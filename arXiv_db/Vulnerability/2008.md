> Spreadsheets provide many of the key links between information systems, closing the gap between business needs and the capability of central systems. Recent regulations have brought these vulnerable parts of information supply chains into focus. The risk they present to the organisation depends on the role that they fulfil, with generic differences between their use as modeling tools and as operational applications. Four sections of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) are particularly relevant to the use of spreadsheets. Compliance with each of these sections is dependent on maintaining the integrity of those spreadsheets acting as operational applications. This can be achieved manually but at high cost. There are a range of commercially available off-the-shelf solutions that can reduce this cost. These may be divided into those that assist in the debugging of logic and more recently the arrival of solutions that monitor the change and user activity taking place in business-critical spreadsheets. ClusterSeven provides one of these monitoring solutions, highlighting areas of operational risk whilst also establishing a database of information to deliver new business intelligence.

<summary>2008-03-25 18:08:03 - Secure Hop-by-Hop Aggregation of End-to-End Concealed Data in Wireless Sensor Networks</summary>

- *Esam Mlaih, Salah A. Aly*

- `0803.3448v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3448v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3448v1)

> In-network data aggregation is an essential technique in mission critical wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for achieving effective transmission and hence better power conservation. Common security protocols for aggregated WSNs are either hop-by-hop or end-to-end, each of which has its own encryption schemes considering different security primitives. End-to-end encrypted data aggregation protocols introduce maximum data secrecy with in-efficient data aggregation and more vulnerability to active attacks, while hop-by-hop data aggregation protocols introduce maximum data integrity with efficient data aggregation and more vulnerability to passive attacks.   In this paper, we propose a secure aggregation protocol for aggregated WSNs deployed in hostile environments in which dual attack modes are present. Our proposed protocol is a blend of flexible data aggregation as in hop-by-hop protocols and optimal data confidentiality as in end-to-end protocols. Our protocol introduces an efficient O(1) heuristic for checking data integrity along with cost-effective heuristic-based divide and conquer attestation process which is $O(\ln{n})$ in average -O(n) in the worst scenario- for further verification of aggregated results.

<summary>2008-04-08 05:22:27 - Cryptanalysis of Yang-Wang-Chang's Password Authentication Scheme with Smart Cards</summary>

- *Al-Sakib Khan Pathan, Choong Seon Hong*

- `0804.1185v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1185v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.1185v1)

> In 2005, Yang, Wang, and Chang proposed an improved timestamp-based password authentication scheme in an attempt to overcome the flaws of Yang-Shieh_s legendary timestamp-based remote authentication scheme using smart cards. After analyzing the improved scheme proposed by Yang-Wang-Chang, we have found that their scheme is still insecure and vulnerable to four types of forgery attacks. Hence, in this paper, we prove that, their claim that their scheme is intractable is incorrect. Also, we show that even an attack based on Sun et al._s attack could be launched against their scheme which they claimed to resolve with their proposal.

<summary>2008-04-23 20:01:01 - Service Cloaking and Authentication at Data Link Layer</summary>

- *Arun Kumar S P*

- `0804.3796v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3796v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.3796v1)

> This paper discusses that there is significant benefit in providing stronger security at lower layers of the network stack for hosts connected to a network. It claims to reduce the attack vulnerability of a networked host by providing security mechanisms in a programmable Network Interface Card (NIC). Dynamic access control mechanisms are implemented in hardware to restrict access to the services provided, only to authenticated hosts. This reduces server vulnerability to various layer 2 attacks. Also the services will be immune to zero-day vulnerabilities due to the minimal code execution paths. To this end, it presents architecture and implementation details of a programmable network interface card equipped with these measures. It works alongside, and augments, existing security protocols making deployment practical.

<summary>2008-06-10 09:34:30 - SPAM over Internet Telephony and how to deal with it</summary>

- *Andreas U. Schmidt, Nicolai Kuntze, Rachid El Khayari*

- `0806.1610v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1610v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.1610v1)

> In our modern society telephony has developed to an omnipresent service. People are available at anytime and anywhere. Furthermore the Internet has emerged to an important communication medium. These facts and the raising availability of broadband internet access has led to the fusion of these two services. Voice over IP or short VoIP is the keyword, that describes this combination. The advantages of VoIP in comparison to classic telephony are location independence, simplification of transport networks, ability to establish multimedia communications and the low costs. Nevertheless one can easily see, that combining two technologies, always brings up new challenges and problems that have to be solved. It is undeniable that one of the most annoying facet of the Internet nowadays is email spam. According to different sources email spam is considered to be 80 to 90 percent of the email traffic produced. The threat of so called voice spam or Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is even more fatal, for the annoyance and disturbance factor is much higher. As instance an email that hits the inbox at 4 p.m. is useless but will not disturb the user much. In contrast a ringing phone at 4 p.m. will lead to a much higher disturbance. From the providers point of view both email spam and voice spam produce unwanted traffic and loss of trust of customers into the service. In order to mitigate this threat different approaches from different parties have been developed. This paper focuses on state of the art anti voice spam solutions, analyses them and reveals their weak points. In the end a SPIT producing benchmark tool will be introduced, that attacks the presented anti voice spam solutions. With this tool it is possible for an administrator of a VoIP network to test how vulnerable his system is.

<summary>2008-08-19 22:54:32 - Secure Neighbor Discovery in Wireless Networks: Formal Investigation of Possibility</summary>

- *Marcin Poturalski, Panos Papadimitratos, Jean-Pierre Hubaux*

- `0808.2668v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2668v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.2668v1)

> Wireless communication enables a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from commodity to tactical systems. Neighbor discovery (ND), that is, determining which devices are within direct radio communication, is a building block of network protocols and applications, and its vulnerability can severely compromise their functionalities. A number of proposals to secure ND have been published, but none have analyzed the problem formally. In this paper, we contribute such an analysis: We build a formal model capturing salient characteristics of wireless systems, most notably obstacles and interference, and we provide a specification of a basic variant of the ND problem. Then, we derive an impossibility result for a general class of protocols we term "time-based protocols," to which many of the schemes in the literature belong. We also identify the conditions under which the impossibility result is lifted. Moreover, we explore a second class of protocols we term "time- and location-based protocols," and prove they can secure ND.

<summary>2008-09-08 15:17:34 - An Information-Theoretical View of Network-Aware Malware Attacks</summary>

- *Zesheng Chen, Chuanyi Ji*

- `0805.0802v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0802v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.0802v2)

> This work investigates three aspects: (a) a network vulnerability as the non-uniform vulnerable-host distribution, (b) threats, i.e., intelligent malwares that exploit such a vulnerability, and (c) defense, i.e., challenges for fighting the threats. We first study five large data sets and observe consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new metric, referred to as the non-uniformity factor, which quantifies the unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the Renyi information entropy and better characterizes the non-uniformity of a distribution than the Shannon entropy. Next, we analyze the propagation speed of network-aware malwares in view of information theory. In particular, we draw a relationship between Renyi entropies and randomized epidemic malware-scanning algorithms. We find that the infection rates of malware-scanning methods are characterized by the Renyi entropies that relate to the information bits in a non-unform vulnerable-host distribution extracted by a randomized scanning algorithm. Meanwhile, we show that a representative network-aware malware can increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a non-uniformity factor when compared to a random-scanning malware at an early stage of malware propagation. This quantifies that how much more rapidly the Internet can be infected at the early stage when a malware exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a network-wide vulnerability. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of defense strategies on the spread of network-aware malwares. Our results demonstrate that counteracting network-aware malwares is a significant challenge for the strategies that include host-based defense and IPv6.

<summary>2008-09-08 15:34:03 - Network Coding Security: Attacks and Countermeasures</summary>

- *Luísa Lima, João P. Vilela, Paulo F. Oliveira, João Barros*

- `0809.1366v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1366v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.1366v1)

> By allowing intermediate nodes to perform non-trivial operations on packets, such as mixing data from multiple streams, network coding breaks with the ruling store and forward networking paradigm and opens a myriad of challenging security questions. Following a brief overview of emerging network coding protocols, we provide a taxonomy of their security vulnerabilities, which highlights the differences between attack scenarios in which network coding is particularly vulnerable and other relevant cases in which the intrinsic properties of network coding allow for stronger and more efficient security solutions than classical routing. Furthermore, we give practical examples where network coding can be combined with classical cryptography both for secure communication and secret key distribution. Throughout the paper we identify a number of research challenges deemed relevant towards the applicability of secure network coding in practical networks.

<summary>2008-10-24 18:42:57 - Dynamics, robustness and fragility of trust</summary>

- *Dusko Pavlovic*

- `0808.0732v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0732v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.0732v3)

> Trust is often conveyed through delegation, or through recommendation. This makes the trust authorities, who process and publish trust recommendations, into an attractive target for attacks and spoofing. In some recent empiric studies, this was shown to lead to a remarkable phenomenon of *adverse selection*: a greater percentage of unreliable or malicious web merchants were found among those with certain types of trust certificates, then among those without. While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in trust authorities, or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics suggests that public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if trust authorities were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the process of trust building, if trust is not breached too often, naturally leads to power-law distributions: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust. The evolutionary processes with such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are known to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We recommend some ways to decrease the vulnerability of trust building, and suggest some ideas for exploration.

<summary>2008-10-25 21:29:03 - Enhancements to A Lightweight RFID Authentication Protocol</summary>

- *Xiaowen Zhang, Zhanyang Zhang, Xinzhou Wei*

- `0810.3345v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3345v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3345v3)

> Vajda and Buttyan (VB) proposed a set of five lightweight RFID authentication protocols. Defend, Fu, and Juels (DFJ) did cryptanalysis on two of them - XOR and SUBSET. To the XOR protocol, DFJ proposed repeated keys attack and nibble attack. In this paper, we identify the vulnerability existed in the original VB's successive session key permutation algorithm. We propose three enhancements to prevent DFJ's attacks and make XOR protocol stronger without introducing extra resource cost.
