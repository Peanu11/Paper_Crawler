> Deploying cloud computing in an enterprise infrastructure bring significant security concerns. Successful implementation of cloud computing in an enterprise requires proper planning and understanding of emerging risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and possible countermeasures. We believe enterprise should analyze the company/organization security risks, threats, and available countermeasures before adopting this technology. In this paper, we have discussed security risks and concerns in cloud computing and enlightened steps that an enterprise can take to reduce security risks and protect their resources. We have also explained cloud computing strengths/benefits, weaknesses, and applicable areas in information risk management.

> After attacking the RSA by injecting fault and corresponding countermeasures, works appear now about the need for protecting RSA public elements against fault attacks. We provide here an extension of a recent attack based on the public modulus corruption. The difficulty to decompose the "Left-To-Right" exponentiation into partial multiplications is overcome by modifying the public modulus to a number with known factorization. This fault model is justified here by a complete study of faulty prime numbers with a fixed size. The good success rate of this attack combined with its practicability raises the question of using faults for changing algebraic properties of finite field based cryptosystems.

<summary>2011-02-07 03:49:40 - Secure Routing in Wireless Mesh Networks</summary>

- *Jaydip Sen*

- `1102.1226v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1226v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.1226v1)

> Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising concept to meet the challenges in next-generation networks such as providing flexible, adaptive, and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective solutions to the service providers. Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point (AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are required to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to the wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that do not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are connected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to conventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other networks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for WMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols for WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all assumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does not hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in WMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks. First, it identifies security vulnerabilities in the medium access control (MAC) and the network layers. Various possibilities of compromising data confidentiality, data integrity, replay attacks and offline cryptanalysis are also discussed. Then various types of attacks in the MAC and the network layers are discussed. After enumerating the various types of attacks on the MAC and the network layer, the chapter briefly discusses on some of the preventive mechanisms for these attacks.

<summary>2011-02-21 05:17:11 - Location Cheating: A Security Challenge to Location-based Social Network Services</summary>

- *Wenbo He, Xue Liu, Mai Ren*

- `1102.4135v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4135v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.4135v1)

> Location-based mobile social network services such as foursquare and Gowalla have grown exponentially over the past several years. These location-based services utilize the geographical position to enrich user experiences in a variety of contexts, including location-based searching and location-based mobile advertising. To attract more users, the location-based mobile social network services provide real-world rewards to the user, when a user checks in at a certain venue or location. This gives incentives for users to cheat on their locations. In this report, we investigate the threat of location cheating attacks, find the root cause of the vulnerability, and outline the possible defending mechanisms. We use foursquare as an example to introduce a novel location cheating attack, which can easily pass the current location verification mechanism (e.g., cheater code of foursquare). We also crawl the foursquare website. By analyzing the crawled data, we show that automated large scale cheating is possible. Through this work, we aim to call attention to location cheating in mobile social network services and provide insights into the defending mechanisms.

- `1103.1360v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1360v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.1360v2)

> This article presents an asynchronous FPGA architecture for implementing cryptographic algorithms secured against physical cryptanalysis. We discuss the suitability of asynchronous reconfigurable architectures for such applications before proceeding to model the side channel and defining our objectives. The logic block architecture is presented in detail. We discuss several solutions for the interconnect architecture, and how these solutions can be ported to other flavours of interconnect (i.e. single driver). Next We discuss in detail a high speed asynchronous configuration chain architecture used to configure our asynchronous FPGA with simulation results, and we present a 3 X 3 prototype FPGA fabricated in 65 nm CMOS. Lastly we present experiments to test the high speed asynchronous configuration chain and evaluate how far our objectives have been achieved with proposed solutions, and we conclude with emphasis on complementary FPGA CAD algorithms, and the effect of CMOS variation on Side-Channel Vulnerability.

<summary>2011-03-23 11:33:57 - An Improved Efficient Key Distribution Mechanism for Large-Scale Heterogeneous Mobile Sensor Networks</summary>

- *Ashok Kumar Das*

- `1103.4496v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4496v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.4496v1)

> Due to resource constraints of the sensor nodes, traditional public key cryptographic techniques are not feasible in most sensor network architectures. Several symmetric key distribution mechanisms are proposed for establishing pairwise keys between sensor nodes in sensor networks, but most of them are not scalable and also are not much suited for mobile sensor networks because they incur much communication as well as computational overheads. Moreover, these schemes are either vulnerable to a small number of compromised sensor nodes or involve expensive protocols for establishing keys. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for establishing keys between sensor nodes with the help of additional high-end sensor nodes, called the auxiliary nodes. Our scheme provides unconditional security against sensor node captures and high network connectivity. In addition, our scheme requires minimal storage requirement for storing keys mainly due to only a single key before deployment in each node in the sensor network, supports efficiently addition of new nodes after initial deployment and also works for any deployment topology.

- `1103.4676v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4676v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.4676v1)

> Pairwise key establishment is one of the fundamental security services in sensor networks which enables sensor nodes in a sensor network to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques. It is not feasible to apply traditional public key management techniques in resource-constrained sensor nodes, and also because the sensor nodes are vulnerable to physical capture. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme called the identity based key pre-distribution using a pseudo random function (IBPRF), which has better trade-off between communication overhead, network connectivity and resilience against node capture compared to the other key pre-distribution schemes. Our scheme can be easily adapted in mobile sensor networks. This scheme supports the addition of new sensor nodes after the initial deployment and also works for any deployment topology. In addition, we propose an improved version of our scheme to support large sensor networks.

<summary>2011-03-24 04:40:12 - An Unconditionally Secure Key Management Scheme for Large-Scale Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks</summary>

- `1103.4678v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4678v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.4678v1)

> Key establishment in sensor networks becomes a challenging problem because of the resource limitations of the sensors and also due to vulnerability to physical capture of the sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose an unconditionally secure probabilistic group-based key pre-distribution scheme for a heterogeneous wireless sensor network. The proposed scheme always guarantees that no matter how many sensor nodes are compromised, the non-compromised nodes can still communicate with 100% secrecy, i.e., the proposed scheme is always unconditionally secure against node capture attacks. Moreover, it provides significantly better trade-off between communication overhead, computational overhead, network connectivity and security against node capture as compared to the existing key pre-distribution schemes. It also supports dynamic node addition after the initial deployment of the nodes in the network.

<summary>2011-04-03 19:52:12 - PadSteg: Introducing Inter-Protocol Steganography</summary>

- *Bartosz Jankowski, Wojciech Mazurczyk, Krzysztof Szczypiorski*

- `1104.0422v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0422v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.0422v1)

> Hiding information in network traffic may lead to leakage of confidential information. In this paper we introduce a new steganographic system: the PadSteg (Padding Steganography). To authors' best knowledge it is the first information hiding solution which represents inter-protocol steganography i.e. usage of relation between two or more protocols from the TCP/IP stack to enable secret communication. PadSteg utilizes ARP and TCP protocols together with an Etherleak vulnerability (improper Ethernet frame padding) to facilitate secret communication for hidden groups in LANs (Local Area Networks). Basing on real network traces we confirm that PadSteg is feasible in today's networks and we estimate what steganographic bandwidth is achievable while limiting the chance of disclosure. We also point at possible countermeasures against PadSteg.

<summary>2011-04-12 16:35:34 - Responsibility Modeling for the Sociotechnical Risk Analysis of Coalitions of Systems</summary>

- *David Greenwood, Ian Sommerville*

- `1104.2265v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2265v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.2265v1)

> Society is challenging systems engineers by demanding ever more complex and integrated systems. With the rise of cloud computing and systems-of-systems (including cyber-physical systems) we are entering an era where mission critical services and applications will be dependent upon 'coalitions-of-systems'. Coalitions-of-systems (CoS) are a class of system similar to systems-of-systems but they differ in that they interact to further overlapping self-interests rather than an overarching mission. Assessing the sociotechnical risks associated with CoS is an open research question of societal importance as existing risk analysis techniques typically focus on the technical aspects of systems and ignore risks associated with coalition partners reneging on responsibilities or leaving the coalition. We demonstrate that a responsibility modeling based risk analysis approach enables the identification of sociotechnical risks associated with CoS. The approach identifies hazards and associated risks that may arise when relying upon a coalition of human/organizational/technical agents to provision a service or application. Through a case study of a proposed cloud IT infrastructure migration we show how the technique identifies vulnerabilities that may arise because of human, organizational or technical agents failing to discharge responsibilities.

<summary>2011-04-26 05:50:02 - Security Through Amnesia: A Software-Based Solution to the Cold Boot Attack on Disk Encryption</summary>

- *Patrick Simmons*

- `1104.4843v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4843v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.4843v1)

> Disk encryption has become an important security measure for a multitude of clients, including governments, corporations, activists, security-conscious professionals, and privacy-conscious individuals. Unfortunately, recent research has discovered an effective side channel attack against any disk mounted by a running machine\cite{princetonattack}. This attack, known as the cold boot attack, is effective against any mounted volume using state-of-the-art disk encryption, is relatively simple to perform for an attacker with even rudimentary technical knowledge and training, and is applicable to exactly the scenario against which disk encryption is primarily supposed to defend: an adversary with physical access. To our knowledge, no effective software-based countermeasure to this attack supporting multiple encryption keys has yet been articulated in the literature. Moreover, since no proposed solution has been implemented in publicly available software, all general-purpose machines using disk encryption remain vulnerable. We present Loop-Amnesia, a kernel-based disk encryption mechanism implementing a novel technique to eliminate vulnerability to the cold boot attack. We offer theoretical justification of Loop-Amnesia's invulnerability to the attack, verify that our implementation is not vulnerable in practice, and present measurements showing our impact on I/O accesses to the encrypted disk is limited to a slowdown of approximately 2x. Loop-Amnesia is written for x86-64, but our technique is applicable to other register-based architectures. We base our work on loop-AES, a state-of-the-art open source disk encryption package for Linux.

- `1105.1846v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1846v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.1846v1)

> Recent Microsoft security bulletins show that kernel vulnerabilities are becoming more and more important security threats. Despite the pretty extensive security mitigations many of the kernel vulnerabilities are still exploitable. Successful kernel exploitation typically grants the attacker maximum privilege level and results in total machine compromise.   To protect against kernel exploitation, we have developed a tool which statically rewrites the Microsoft Windows kernel as well as other kernel level modules. Such rewritten binary files allow us to monitor control flow transfers during operating system execution. At this point we are able to detect whether selected control transfer flow is valid or should be considered as an attack attempt. Our solution is especially directed towards preventing remote kernel exploitation attempts. Additionally, many of the local privilege escalation attacks are also blocked (also due to additional mitigation techniques we have implemented). Our tool was tested with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (under both virtual and physical machines) on IA-32 compatible processors. Our apparatus is also completely standalone and does not require any third party software.

<summary>2011-06-07 09:09:18 - DDoS Attack and Defense Scheme in Wireless Ad hoc Networks</summary>

- `1106.1287v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1287v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1287v1)

> The wireless ad hoc networks are highly vulnerable to distributed denial of service(DDoS) attacks because of its unique characteristics such as open network architecture, shared wireless medium and stringent resource constraints. These attacks throttle the tcp throughput heavily and reduce the quality of service(QoS) to end systems gradually rather than refusing the clients from the services completely. In this paper, we discussed the DDoS attacks and proposed a defense scheme to improve the performance of the ad hoc networks. Our proposed defense mechanism uses the medium access control (MAC) layer information to detect the attackers. The status values from MAC layer that can be used for detection are Frequency of receiving RTS/CTS packets, Frequency of sensing a busy channel and the number of RTS/DATA retransmissions. Once the attackers are identified, all the packets from those nodes will be blocked. The network resources are made available to the legitimate users. We perform the simulation with Network Simulator NS2 and we proved that our proposed system improves the network performance.

- `1106.3746v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3746v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.3746v1)

> In security protocol analysis, the traditional choice to consider a single Dolev-Yao attacker is supported by the fact that models with multiple collaborating Dolev-Yao attackers have been shown to be reducible to models with one Dolev-Yao attacker. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach and investigate the case of multiple non-collaborating attackers. After formalizing the framework for multi-attacker scenarios, we show with a case study that concurrent competitive attacks can interfere with each other. We then present a new strategy to defend security protocols, based on active exploitation of attack interference. The paper can be seen as providing two proof-of-concept results: (i) it is possible to exploit interference to mitigate protocol vulnerabilities, thus providing a form of protection to protocols; (ii) the search for defense strategies requires scenarios with at least two attackers.

> Vulnerabilities related to weak passwords are a pressing global economic and security issue. We report a novel, simple, and effective approach to address the weak password problem. Building upon chaotic dynamics, criticality at phase transitions, CAPTCHA recognition, and computational round-off errors we design an algorithm that strengthens security of passwords. The core idea of our method is to split a long and secure password into two components. The first component is memorized by the user. The second component is transformed into a CAPTCHA image and then protected using evolution of a two-dimensional dynamical system close to a phase transition, in such a way that standard brute-force attacks become ineffective. We expect our approach to have wide applications for authentication and encryption technologies.

> Password authentication is the most commonly used technique to authenticate the user validity. However, due to its simplicity, it is vulnerable to pseudo attacks. It can be enhanced using various biometric techniques such as thumb impression, finger movement, eye movement etc. In this paper, we concentrate on the most economic technique, based on the user habitual rhythm pattern i.e. not what they type but how they type is the measure for authenticating the user. We consider the latency between key events as the trajectory, and trajectory clustering is used to obtain the hidden patterns of the user. Obtained pattern can be considered as a cluster of measurements that can be used to differentiate from other users. We evaluated the proposed technique on the data obtained from the 100 users.

- `1108.1302v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1302v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1302v1)

> Establishment of pairwise keys between sensor nodes in a sensor network is a difficult problem due to resource limitations of sensor nodes as well as vulnerability to physical captures of sensor nodes by the enemy. Public-key cryptosystems are not much suited for most resource-constrained sensor networks. Recently, elliptic curve cryptographic techniques show that public key cryptosystem is also feasible for resource-constrained sensor networks. However, most researchers accept that the symmetric key cryptosystems are viable options for resource-constrained sensor networks. In this paper, we first develop a basic principle to address the key pre-distribution problem in mobile sensor networks. Then, using this developed basic principle, we propose a scheme which takes the advantage of the post-deployment knowledge. Our scheme is a modified version of the key prioritization technique proposed by Liu and Ning. Our improved scheme provides reasonable network connectivity and security. Moreover, the proposed scheme works for any deployment topology.

> Spam messes up users inbox, consumes resources and spread attacks like DDoS, MiM, phishing etc. Phishing is a byproduct of email and causes financial loss to users and loss of reputation to financial institutions. In this paper we examine the characteristics of phishing and technology used by Phishers. In order to counter anti-phishing technology, phishers change their mode of operation; therefore a continuous evaluation of phishing only helps us combat phisher effectiveness. In our study, we collected seven hundred thousand spam from a corporate server for a period of 13 months from February 2008 to February 2009. From the collected data, we identified different kinds of phishing scams and mode of operation. Our observation shows that phishers are dynamic and depend more on social engineering techniques rather than software vulnerabilities. We believe that this study will develop more efficient anti-phishing methodologies. Based on our analysis, we developed an anti-phishing methodology and implemented in our network. The results show that this approach is highly effective to prevent phishing attacks. The proposed approach reduced more than 80% of the false negatives and more than 95% of phishing attacks in our network.

> Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regularly deployed in unattended and hostile environments. The WSN is vulnerable to security threats and susceptible to physical capture. Thus, it is necessary to use effective mechanisms to protect the network. It is widely known, that the intrusion detection is one of the most efficient security mechanisms to protect the network against malicious attacks or unauthorized access. In this paper, we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system for clustered WSN. Our intrusion framework uses a combination between the Anomaly Detection based on support vector machine (SVM) and the Misuse Detection. Experiments results show that most of routing attacks can be detected with low false alarm.

The principle interface is provided through a local web server which supports an interface similar to Google.com's normal web page. Indexing of local files occurs when the system is idle, and understands a number of common file types. A optional feature is that Google Desktop can integrate a short summary of a local search results with Google.com web searches. This summary includes 30-40 character snippets of local files. We have uncovered a vulnerability that would release private local data to an unauthorized remote entity. Using two different attacks, we expose the small snippets of private local data to a remote third party.

> The session initiation protocol (SIP) is a powerful signaling protocol that controls communication on the Internet, establishing, maintaining, and terminating the sessions. The services that are enabled by SIP are equally applicable in the world of mobile and ubiquitous computing. In 2009, Tsai proposed an authenticated key agreement scheme as an enhancement to SIP. Very recently, Arshad et al. demonstrated that Tsai's scheme was vulnerable to offline password guessing attack and stolen-verifier attack. They also pointed that Tsai's scheme did not provide known-key secrecy and perfect forward secrecy. In order to overcome the weaknesses, Arshad et al. also proposed an improved mutual authentication scheme based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem for SIP and claimed that their scheme can withstand various attacks. In this paper, we do a cryptanalysis of Arshad et al.'s scheme and show that Arshad et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to the password guessing attack.

> Many open-source projects land security fixes in public repositories before shipping these patches to users. This paper presents attacks on such projects - taking Firefox as a case-study - that exploit patch metadata to efficiently search for security patches prior to shipping. Using access-restricted bug reports linked from patch descriptions, security patches can be immediately identified for 260 out of 300 days of Firefox 3 development. In response to Mozilla obfuscating descriptions, we show that machine learning can exploit metadata such as patch author to search for security patches, extending the total window of vulnerability by 5 months in an 8 month period when examining up to two patches daily. Finally we present strong evidence that further metadata obfuscation is unlikely to prevent information leaks, and we argue that open-source projects instead ought to keep security patches secret until they are ready to be released.

Existing social network-based solutions to mitigate the Sybil attacks in DHT routing have a high state requirement and do not provide an adequate level of privacy. For instance, such techniques require a user to reveal their social network contacts. We design X-Vine, a protection mechanism for distributed hash tables that operates entirely by communicating over social network links. As with traditional peer-to-peer systems, X-Vine provides robustness, scalability, and a platform for innovation. The use of social network links for communication helps protect participant privacy and adds a new dimension of trust absent from previous designs. X-Vine is resilient to denial of service via Sybil attacks, and in fact is the first Sybil defense that requires only a logarithmic amount of state per node, making it suitable for large-scale and dynamic settings. X-Vine also helps protect the privacy of users social network contacts and keeps their IP addresses hidden from those outside of their social circle, providing a basis for pseudonymous communication. We first evaluate our design with analysis and simulations, using several real world large-scale social networking topologies. We show that the constraints of X-Vine allow the insertion of only a logarithmic number of Sybil identities per attack edge; we show this mitigates the impact of malicious attacks while not affecting the performance of honest nodes. Moreover, our algorithms are efficient, maintain low stretch, and avoid hot spots in the network. We validate our design with a PlanetLab implementation and a Facebook plugin.

> Collaborative spectrum sensing can significantly improve the detection performance of secondary unlicensed users (SUs). However, the performance of collaborative sensing is vulnerable to sensing data falsification attacks, where malicious SUs (attackers) submit manipulated sensing reports to mislead the fusion center's decision on spectrum occupancy. Moreover, attackers may not follow the fusion center's decision regarding their spectrum access. This paper considers a challenging attack scenario where multiple rational attackers overhear all honest SUs' sensing reports and cooperatively maximize attackers' aggregate spectrum utilization. We show that, without attack-prevention mechanisms, honest SUs are unable to transmit over the licensed spectrum, and they may further be penalized by the primary user for collisions due to attackers' aggressive transmissions. To prevent such attacks, we propose two novel attack-prevention mechanisms with direct and indirect punishments. The key idea is to identify collisions to the primary user that should not happen if all SUs follow the fusion center's decision. Unlike prior work, the proposed simple mechanisms do not require the fusion center to identify and exclude attackers. The direct punishment can effectively prevent all attackers from behaving maliciously. The indirect punishment is easier to implement and can prevent attacks when the attackers care enough about their long-term reward.

> Intra-session network coding is known to be vulnerable to pollution attacks. In this work, first, we introduce a novel homomorphic MAC scheme called SpaceMac, which allows an intermediate node to verify if its received packets belong to a specific subspace, even if the subspace is expanding over time. Then, we use SpaceMac as a building block to design a cooperative scheme that provides complete defense against pollution attacks: (i) it can detect polluted packets early at intermediate nodes and (ii) it can identify the exact location of all, even colluding, attackers, thus making it possible to eliminate them. Our scheme is cooperative: parents and children of any node cooperate to detect any corrupted packets sent by the node, and nodes in the network cooperate with a central controller to identify the exact location of all attackers. We implement SpaceMac in both C/C++ and Java as a library, and we make the library available online. Our evaluation on both a PC and an Android device shows that (i) SpaceMac's algorithms can be computed quickly and efficiently, and (ii) our cooperative defense scheme has low computation and significantly lower communication overhead than other comparable state-of-the-art schemes.

> The challenging number is used for the detection of Spoofing attack. The IP Spoofing is considered to be one of the potentially brutal attack which acts as a tool for the DDoS attack which is considered to be a major threat among security problems in today's internet. These kinds of attack are extremely severe. They bring down business of company drastically. DDoS attack can easily exhaust the computing and communication resources of its victim within a short period of time. There are attacks exploiting some vulnerability or implementation bug in the software implementation of a service to bring that down and some attacks will use all the available resources at the target machine. This deals on attacks that consume all the bandwidth available to the victim machine. While concentrating on the bandwidth attack the TCP SYN flood is the more prominent attack. TCP/IP protocol suite is the most widely used protocol suite for data communication. The TCP SYN flood works by exhausting the TCP connection queue of the host and thus denying legitimate connection request. There are various methods used to detect and prevent this attack, one of which is to block the packet based on SYN flag count from the same IP address. This kind of prevention methods becomes unsuitable when the attackers use the Spoofed IP address. The SYN spoofing becomes a major tool the TCP SYN flooding. For the prevention of this kind of attacks, the TCP specific probing is used in the proposed scheme where the client is requested challenging number while sending the ACK in the three way hand shake. This is very useful to find the Spoofed IP Packets/TCP SYN flood and preventing them.

> The development of the SJ Framework for session-based distributed programming is part of recent and ongoing research into integrating session types and practical, real-world programming languages. SJ programs featuring session types (protocols) are statically checked by the SJ compiler to verify the key property of communication safety, meaning that parties engaged in a session only communicate messages, including higher-order communications via session delegation, that are compatible with the message types expected by the recipient.   This paper presents current work on security aspects of the SJ Framework. Firstly, we discuss our implementation experience from improving the SJ Runtime platform with security measures to protect and augment communication safety at runtime. We implement a transport component for secure session execution that uses a modified TLS connection with authentication based on the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol. The key technical point is the delicate treatment of secure session delegation to counter a previous vulnerability. We find that the modular design of the SJ Runtime, based on the notion of an Abstract Transport for session communication, supports rapid extension to utilise additional transports whilst separating this concern from the application-level session programming task. In the second part of this abstract, we formally prove the target security properties by modelling the extended SJ delegation protocols in the pi-calculus.

> Recognition systems are commonly designed to authenticate users at the access control levels of a system. A number of voice recognition methods have been developed using a pitch estimation process which are very vulnerable in low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) environments thus, these programs fail to provide the desired level of accuracy and robustness. Also, most text independent speaker recognition programs are incapable of coping with unauthorized attempts to gain access by tampering with the samples or reference database. The proposed text-independent voice recognition system makes use of multilevel cryptography to preserve data integrity while in transit or storage. Encryption and decryption follow a transform based approach layered with pseudorandom noise addition whereas for pitch detection, a modified version of the autocorrelation pitch extraction algorithm is used. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can decrypt the signal under test with exponentially reducing Mean Square Error over an increasing range of SNR. Further, it outperforms the conventional algorithms in actual identification tasks even in noisy environments. The recognition rate thus obtained using the proposed method is compared with other conventional methods used for speaker identification.

> In multi-hop mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs),mobile nodes cooperate with each other without using any infrastructure such as access points or base stations. Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.

> A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of autonomous nodes that communicate with each other by forming a multi-hop radio network and maintaining connections in a decentralized manner. Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms,absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Most of the routing protocols for MANETs are thus vulnerable to various types of attacks. Ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) is a very popular routing algorithm. However, it is vulnerable to the well-known black hole attack, where a malicious node falsely advertises good paths to a destination node during the route discovery process. This attack becomes more sever when a group of malicious nodes cooperate each other. In this paper, a defense mechanism is presented against a coordinated attack by multiple black hole nodes in a MANET. The simulation carried out on the proposed scheme has produced results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the mechanism in detection of the attack while maintaining a reasonable level of throughput in the network.

> We study the automatic synthesis of fair non-repudiation protocols, a class of fair exchange protocols, used for digital contract signing. First, we show how to specify the objectives of the participating agents and the trusted third party (TTP) as path formulas in LTL and prove that the satisfaction of these objectives imply fairness; a property required of fair exchange protocols. We then show that weak (co-operative) co-synthesis and classical (strictly competitive) co-synthesis fail, whereas assume-guarantee synthesis (AGS) succeeds. We demonstrate the success of assume-guarantee synthesis as follows: (a) any solution of assume-guarantee synthesis is attack-free; no subset of participants can violate the objectives of the other participants; (b) the Asokan-Shoup-Waidner (ASW) certified mail protocol that has known vulnerabilities is not a solution of AGS; (c) the Kremer-Markowitch (KM) non-repudiation protocol is a solution of AGS; and (d) AGS presents a new and symmetric fair non-repudiation protocol that is attack-free. To our knowledge this is the first application of synthesis to fair non-repudiation protocols, and our results show how synthesis can both automatically discover vulnerabilities in protocols and generate correct protocols. The solution to assume-guarantee synthesis can be computed efficiently as the secure equilibrium solution of three-player graph games.

> Even though passwords are the most convenient means of authentication, they bring along themselves the threat of dictionary attacks. Dictionary attacks may be of two kinds: online and offline. While offline dictionary attacks are possible only if the adversary is able to collect data for a successful protocol execution by eavesdropping on the communication channel and can be successfully countered using public key cryptography, online dictionary attacks can be performed by anyone and there is no satisfactory solution to counter them. This paper presents a new authentication protocol which is called CompChall (computational challenge). The proposed protocol uses only one way hash functions as the building blocks and attempts to eliminate online dictionary attacks by implementing a challenge-response system. This challenge-response system is designed in a fashion that it does not pose any difficulty to a genuine user but is time consuming and computationally intensive for an adversary trying to launch a large number of login requests per unit time as in the case of an online dictionary attack. The protocol is stateless and thus less vulnerable to DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.

- `1111.5382v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5382v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.5382v1)

> Here we present a range-limited approach to centrality measures in both non-weighted and weighted directed complex networks. We introduce an efficient method that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality based on shortest paths of lengths not longer than $\ell = 1,...,L$ in case of non-weighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities based on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than $w_{\ell}=\ell \Delta$, $\ell=1,2...,L=R/\Delta$. These measures provide a systematic description on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its network neighborhoods 1-step out, 2-steps out, etc. up to including the whole network. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws for large non-weighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality measures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently estimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the traditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the ranking top-list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities quickly freezes as function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top-list can be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest node-to-node distance for a network of $N$ nodes, exploiting the aforementioned scaling behavior. These observations are illustrated on model networks and on a large social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs ($\sim 5.5\times 10^6$ nodes and $\sim 2.7\times 10^7$ edges). Finally, we apply these concepts to efficiently detect the vulnerability backbone of a network (defined as the smallest percolating cluster of the highest betweenness nodes and edges) and illustrate the importance of weight-based centrality measures in weighted networks in detecting such backbones.

> Cryptography algorithm standards play a key role both to the practice of information security and to cryptography theory research. Among them, the MQV and HMQV protocols ((H)MQV, in short) are a family of (implicitly authenticated) Diffie-Hellman key-exchange (DHKE) protocols that are widely standardized and deployed. In this work, from some new perspectives and approaches and under some new design rationales and insights, we develop a new family of practical implicitly authenticated DHKE protocols, which enjoy notable performance among security, privacy, efficiency and easy deployment. We make detailed comparisons between our new DHKE protocols and (H)MQV, showing that the newly developed protocols outperform HMQV in most aspects. Along the way, guided by our new design rationales, we also identify a new vulnerability (H)MQV, which brings some new perspectives (e.g., computational fairness) to the literature.

This paper focuses on differential cryptanalysis of the algorithm and finds that some properties of IEAS can support a differential attack to recover equivalent secret key with a little small number of known plain-images. Detailed approaches of the cryptanalysis for cryptanalyzing IEAS of the lower round number are presented and the breaking method can be extended to the case of higher round number. Both theoretical analysis and experiment results are provided to support vulnerability of IEAS against differential attack. In addition, some other security defects of IEAS, including insensitivity with respect to changes of plain-images and insufficient size of key space, are also reported.
