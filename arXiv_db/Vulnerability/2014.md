> Relay transmission can enhance coverage and throughput, while it can be vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to the additional transmission of the source message at the relay. Thus, whether or not one should use relay transmission for secure communication is an interesting and important problem. In this paper, we consider the transmission of a confidential message from a source to a destination in a decentralized wireless network in the presence of randomly distributed eavesdroppers. The source-destination pair can be potentially assisted by randomly distributed relays. For an arbitrary relay, we derive exact expressions of secure connection probability for both colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers. We further obtain lower bound expressions on the secure connection probability, which are accurate when the eavesdropper density is small. By utilizing these lower bound expressions, we propose a relay selection strategy to improve the secure connection probability. By analytically comparing the secure connection probability for direct transmission and relay transmission, we address the important problem of whether or not to relay and discuss the condition for relay transmission in terms of the relay density and source-destination distance. These analytical results are accurate in the small eavesdropper density regime.

> The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which is an inter connection of networks through an insecure public channel i.e. Internet demands for authenticating the remote user trying to access the secure network resources. In 2013, Ankita et al. proposed an improved three factor remote user authentication scheme. In this poster we will show that Ankita et al scheme is vulnerable to known session specific temporary information attack, on successfully performing the attack, the adversary can perform all other major cryptographic attacks. As a part of our contribution, we will propose an improved scheme which is resistance to all major cryptographic attacks and overcomes the defects in Ankita et al. scheme.

- `1401.3592v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3592v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3592v1)

> This thesis aims to use intelligent systems to extend and improve performance and security of cryptographic techniques. Genetic algorithms framework for cryptanalysis problem is addressed. A novel extension to the differential cryptanalysis using genetic algorithm is proposed and a fitness measure based on the differential characteristics of the cipher being attacked is also proposed. The complexity of the proposed attack is shown to be less than quarter of normal differential cryptanalysis of the same cipher by applying the proposed attack to both the basic Substitution Permutation Network and the Feistel Network. The basic models of modern block ciphers are attacked instead of actual cipher to prove that the attack is applicable to other ciphers vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. A new attack for block cipher based on the ability of neural networks to perform an approximation of mapping is proposed. A complete problem formulation is explained and implementation of the attack on some hypothetical Feistel cipher not vulnerable to differential or linear attacks is presented. A new block cipher based on the neural networks is proposed. A complete cipher structure is given and a key scheduling is also shown. The main properties of neural network being able to perform mapping between large dimension domains in a very fast and a very small memory compared to S-Boxes is used as a base for the cipher.

> We develop a modeling technique based on interpreted systems in order to verify temporal-epistemic properties over access control policies. This approach enables us to detect information flow vulnerabilities in dynamic policies by verifying the knowledge of the agents gained by both reading and reasoning about system information. To overcome the practical limitations of state explosion in model-checking temporal-epistemic properties, we introduce a novel abstraction and refinement technique for temporal-epistemic safety properties in ACTLK (ACTL with knowledge modality K) and a class of interesting properties that does fall in this category.

- `1401.7444v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7444v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7444v1)

> As mobile phones have evolved into `smartphones', with complex operating systems running third- party software, they have become increasingly vulnerable to malicious applications (malware). We introduce a new design for mitigating malware attacks against smartphone users, based on a small trusted computing base module, denoted uTCB. The uTCB manages sensitive data and sensors, and provides core services to applications, independently of the operating system. The user invokes uTCB using a simple secure attention key, which is pressed in order to validate physical possession of the device and authorize a sensitive action; this protects private information even if the device is infected with malware. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of uTCB based on ARM's TrustZone, a secure execution environment increasingly found in smartphones, and evaluate our implementation using simulations.

> SAML assertions are becoming popular method for passing authentication and authorisation information between identity providers and consumers using various single sign-on protocols. However their practical security strongly depends on correct implementation, especially on the consumer side. Somorovsky and others have demonstrated a number of XML signature related vulnerabilities in SAML assertion validation frameworks. This article demonstrates how bad library documentation and examples can lead to vulnerable consumer code and how this can be avoided.

<summary>2014-02-06 00:35:37 - TouchIn: Sightless Two-factor Authentication on Multi-touch Mobile Devices</summary>

- `1402.1216v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1216v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1216v1)

> Mobile authentication is indispensable for preventing unauthorized access to multi-touch mobile devices. Existing mobile authentication techniques are often cumbersome to use and also vulnerable to shoulder-surfing and smudge attacks. This paper focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating TouchIn, a two-factor authentication system on multi-touch mobile devices. TouchIn works by letting a user draw on the touchscreen with one or multiple fingers to unlock his mobile device, and the user is authenticated based on the geometric properties of his drawn curves as well as his behavioral and physiological characteristics. TouchIn allows the user to draw on arbitrary regions on the touchscreen without looking at it. This nice sightless feature makes TouchIn very easy to use and also robust to shoulder-surfing and smudge attacks. Comprehensive experiments on Android devices confirm the high security and usability of TouchIn.

> Vulnerability Discovery with attack Injection security threats are increasing for the server software, when software is developed, the software tested for the functionality. Due to unawareness of software vulnerabilities most of the software before pre-Release the software should be thoroughly tested for not only functionality reliability, but should be tested for the security flows (or) vulnerabilities. The approaches such as fuzzers, Fault injection, vulnerabilities scanners, static vulnerabilities analyzers, Run time prevention mechanisms and software Rejuvenation are identifying the un-patched software which is open for security threats address to solve the problem "security testing". These techniques are useful for generating attacks but cannot be extendable for the new land of attacks. The system called proactive vulnerability attack injection tool is suitable for adding new attacks injection vectors, methods to define new protocol states (or) Specification using the interface of tool includes Network server protocol specification using GUI, Attacks generator, Attack injector, monitoring module at the victim injector, monitoring module at the victim machine and the attacks injection report generation. This tool can address most of the vulnerabilities (or) security flows.

<summary>2014-02-10 17:23:11 - NDTAODV: Neighbor Defense Technique for Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector(AODV) to mitigate flood attack in MANETS</summary>

- *Akshai Aggarwal, Savita Gandhi, Nirbhay Chaubey, Naren Tada, Srushti Trivedi*

- `1405.6216v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6216v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6216v1)

> Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are collections of mobile nodes that can communicate with one another using multihop wireless links. MANETs are often deployed in the environments, where there is no fixed infrastructure and centralized management. The nodes of mobile ad hoc networks are susceptible to compromise. In such a scenario, designing an efficient, reliable and secure routing protocol has been a major challengesue over the last many years. The routing protocol Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) has no security measures in-built in it. It is vulnerable to many types of routing attacks. The flood attack is one of them. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to secure Ad hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol against flood attacks. To deal with a flood attack, we have proposed Neighbor Defense Technique for Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (NDTAODV). This makes AODV more robust. The proposed technique has been designed to isolate the flood attacker with the use of timers, peak value and hello alarm technique. We have simulated our work in Network Simulator NS-2.33 (NS-2) with different pause times by way of different number of malicious nodes. We have compared the performance of NDTAODV with the AODV in normal situation as well as in the presence of malicious attacks. We have considered Packet Delivery Fraction (PDF), Average Throughput (AT) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL) for comparing the performance of NDTAODV and AODV.

- `1402.6497v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6497v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6497v1)

> Considering computer systems, security is the major concern with usability. Security policies need to be developed to protect information from unauthorized access. Passwords and secrete codes used between users and information systems for secure user authentication with the system. Playing a vital role in security, easily guessed passwords are links to vulnerability. They allow invader to put system resources significantly closer to access them, other accounts on nearby machines and possibly even administrative privileges with different threats and vulnerabilities (e.g., phishing, key logging and malwares). The purpose of this system is to introduce the concept and methodology which helps organization and users to implement stronger password policies. This paper studies a password stealing and reuse issues of password based authentication systems. Techniques and concepts of authentication are discussed which gives rise to a novel approach of two-factor authentication. Avoiding password reuse is a crucial issue in information systems which can at some extent contribute to password stealing issue also. In the proposed system, each participating website possesses a user's unique phone number, telecommunication services in registration and recovery phases and a long-term password used to generate one-time password for each login session on all websites.

- *U. Herath, J. Alawatugoda, R. G. Ragel*

- `1403.1322v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1322v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.1322v1)

> Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm which is extensively used in secure electronic data transmission. When introduced, although it was tested and declared as secure, in 2005, a researcher named Bernstein claimed that it is vulnerable to side channel attacks. The cache-based timing attack is the type of side channel attack demonstrated by Bernstein, which uses the timing variation in cache hits and misses. This kind of attacks can be prevented by masking the actual timing information from the attacker. Such masking can be performed by altering the original AES software implementation while preserving its semantics. This paper presents possible software implementation level countermeasures against Bernstein's cache timing attack. Two simple software based countermeasures based on the concept of "constant-encryption-time" were demonstrated against the remote cache timing attack with positive outcomes, in which we establish a secured environment for the AES encryption.

<summary>2014-03-08 01:08:45 - Text Entry Method Affects Password Security</summary>

- `1403.1910v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1910v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.1910v1)

> Text-based passwords continue to be the prime form of authentication to computer systems. Today, they are increasingly created and used with mobile text entry methods, such as touchscreens and mobile keyboards, in addition to traditional physical keyboards. This raises a foundational question for usable security: whether text entry methods affect password generation and password security. This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63 participants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual accounts using a different text entry method. Participants were also asked to recall their passwords afterwards. We applied analysis of structures and probabilities, with standard and recent security metrics and also performed cracking attacks on the collected data. The results show a significant effect of text entry methods on passwords. In particular, one of the experimental groups created passwords with significantly more lowercase letters per password than the control group ($t(60) = 2.99, p = 0.004$). The choices for character types in each group were also significantly different ($p=0.048, FET$). Our cracking attacks consequently expose significantly different resistance across groups ($p=0.031, FET$) and text entry method vulnerabilities. Our findings contribute to the understanding of password security in the context of usable interfaces.

> It is estimated that Italian Mafias registered 135 billion euros in profits only in 2010. Part of this huge amount of money, coming mostly from the drugs, prostitution and arms illicit markets, is often used to invest into legitimate private economies. As a consequence, the affected economies destabilise, become entrenched with violent forms of competition and are bound to stagnation. Nonetheless, few are the attempts to uncover the patterns followed by criminal organisations in their business ventures. The reason lays mostly in the poor availability of data on criminal activity, or in the highly risky task of gather it.   This paper partially fills this gap thanks to access to information about the Sicilian Mafia in a city. More specifically, it tries to analyse the nature and extent of criminal infiltration into the legitimate private economy of the case-study using network techniques. The research demonstrates that sectors with a high degree of centrality and comprising fewer firms are the most vulnerable to this kind of security threat. It also shows that centrality is also the key criterion that makes a firm sensitive to infiltration, provided it belongs to a susceptible economic sector.

> Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks exhaust victim's bandwidth or services. Traditional architecture of Internet is vulnerable to DDoS attacks and an ongoing cycle of attack & defense is observed. In this paper, different types and techniques of DDoS attacks and their countermeasures are reviewed. The significance of this paper is the coverage of many aspects of countering DDoS attacks including new research on the topic. We survey different papers describing methods of defense against DDoS attacks based on entropy variations, traffic anomaly parameters, neural networks, device level defense, botnet flux identifications and application layer DDoS defense. We also discuss some traditional methods of defense such as traceback and packet filtering techniques so that readers can identify major differences between traditional and current techniques of defense against DDoS attacks. Before the discussion on countermeasures, we mention different attack types under DDoS with traditional and advanced schemes while some information on DDoS trends in the year 2012 Quarter-1 is also provided. We identify that application layer DDoS attacks possess the ability to produce greater impact on the victim as they are driven by legitimate-like traffic making it quite difficult to identify and distinguish from legitimate requests. The need of improved defense against such attacks is therefore more demanding in research. The study conducted in this paper can be helpful for readers and researchers to recognize better techniques of defense in current times against DDoS attacks and contribute with more research on the topic in the light of future challenges identified in this paper.

- `1403.5628v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5628v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5628v1)

> Vulnerability is a weakness, shortcoming or flaw in the system or network infrastructure which can be used by an attacker to harm the system, disrupt its normal operation and use it for his financial, competitive or other motives or just for cyber escapades. In this paper, we re-examined the various types of attacks on industrial control systems as well as on social networking users. We have listed which all vulnerabilities were exploited for executing these attacks and their effects on these systems and social networks. The focus will be mainly on the vulnerabilities that are used in OSNs as the convertors which convert the social network into antisocial network and these networks can be further used for the network attacks on the users associated with the victim user whereby creating a consecutive chain of attacks on increasing number of social networking users. Another type of attack, Stuxnet Attack which was originally designed to attack Iran's nuclear facilities is also discussed here which harms the system it controls by changing the code in that target system. The Stuxnet worm is a very treacherous and hazardous means of attack and is the first of its kind as it allows the attacker to manipulate real time equipment.

- `1403.5871v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5871v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5871v1)

> Wireless networks are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in which a malicious node poses as many identities in order to gain disproportionate influence. Many defenses based on spatial variability of wireless channels exist, but depend either on detailed, multi-tap channel estimation - something not exposed on commodity 802.11 devices - or valid RSSI observations from multiple trusted sources, e.g., corporate access points - something not directly available in ad hoc and delay-tolerant networks with potentially malicious neighbors. We extend these techniques to be practical for wireless ad hoc networks of commodity 802.11 devices. Specifically, we propose two efficient methods for separating the valid RSSI observations of behaving nodes from those falsified by malicious participants. Further, we note that prior signalprint methods are easily defeated by mobile attackers and develop an appropriate challenge-response defense. Finally, we present the Mason test, the first implementation of these techniques for ad hoc and delay-tolerant networks of commodity 802.11 devices. We illustrate its performance in several real-world scenarios.

> With the increasing concern for security in the network, many approaches are laid out that try to protect the network from unauthorised access. New methods have been adopted in order to find the potential discrepancies that may damage the network. Most commonly used approach is the vulnerability assessment. By vulnerability, we mean, the potential flaws in the system that make it prone to the attack. Assessment of these system vulnerabilities provide a means to identify and develop new strategies so as to protect the system from the risk of being damaged. This paper focuses on the usage of various vulnerability scanners and their related methodology to detect the various vulnerabilities available in the web applications or the remote host across the network and tries to identify new mechanisms that can be deployed to secure the network.

- `1403.7293v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7293v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.7293v1)

> Rijndael was standardized in 2001 by National Institute of Standard and Technology as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is still being used to encrypt financial, military and even government confidential data. In 2005, Bernstein illustrated a remote cache timing attack on AES using the client-server architecture and therefore proved a side channel in its software implementation. Over the years, a number of countermeasures have been proposed against cache timing attacks both using hardware and software. Although the software based countermeasures are flexible and easy to deploy, most of such countermeasures are vulnerable to statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel software based countermeasure against cache timing attacks, known as constant time encryption, which we believe is secure against statistical analysis. The countermeasure we proposed performs rescheduling of instructions such that the encryption rounds will consume constant time independent of the cache hits and misses. Through experiments, we prove that our countermeasure is secure against Bernstein's cache timing attack.

> Cache timing attack is a type of side channel attack where the leaking timing information due to the cache behaviour of a crypto system is used by an attacker to break the system. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was considered a secure encryption standard until 2005 when Daniel Bernstein claimed that the software implementation of AES is vulnerable to cache timing attack. Bernstein demonstrated a remote cache timing attack on a software implementation of AES. The original AES implementation can methodically be altered to prevent the cache timing attack by hiding the natural cache-timing pattern during the encryption while preserving its semantics. The alternations while preventing the attack should not make the implementation very slow. In this paper, we report outcomes of our experiments on designing and implementing a number of possible countermeasures.

> Security risk management can be applied on well-defined or existing systems; in this case, the objective is to identify existing vulnerabilities, assess the risks and provide for the adequate countermeasures. Security risk management can also be applied very early in the system's development life-cycle, when its architecture is still poorly defined; in this case, the objective is to positively influence the design work so as to produce a secure architecture from the start. The latter work is made difficult by the uncertainties on the architecture and the multiple round-trips required to keep the risk assessment study and the system architecture aligned. This is particularly true for very large projects running over many years. This paper addresses the issues raised by those risk assessment studies performed early in the system's development life-cycle. Based on industrial experience, it asserts that attack trees can help solve the human cognitive scalability issue related to securing those large, continuously-changing system-designs. However, big attack trees are difficult to build, and even more difficult to maintain. This paper therefore proposes a systematic approach to automate the construction and maintenance of such big attack trees, based on the system's operational and logical architectures, the system's traditional risk assessment study and a security knowledge database.

> Information is the key asset of all organizations and can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically, transmitted by mail or by electronic means, shown in films, or spoken in conversation. In today's competitive business environment, such information is constantly under threat from many sources, which can be internal, external, accidental, or malicious. Joomla is a very popular Content Management System (CMS) used for web page maintenance. This highly versatile software has found itself in both large corporate web portals, and simple web pages such as blogs. Such popularity increases its vulnerability to potential attacks and therefore needs an appropriate security management. ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) created the series of standards aimed at providing a model for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). This paper shows how principles set in ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards can be used to improve security of Joomla based web portals.

> Ever since the introduction of the internet, it has been void of any privacy. The majority of internet traffic currently is and always has been unencrypted. A number of anonymous communication overlay networks exist whose aim it is to provide privacy to its users. However, due to the nature of the internet, there is major difficulty in getting these networks to become both decentralized and anonymous. We list reasons for having anonymous networks, discern the problems in achieving decentralization and sum up the biggest initiatives in the field and their current status. To do so, we use one exemplary network, the Tor network. We explain how Tor works, what vulnerabilities this network currently has, and possible attacks that could be used to violate privacy and anonymity. The Tor network is used as a key comparison network in the main part of the report: a tabular overview of the major anonymous networking technologies in use today.

> Physical implementations of cryptographic algorithms leak information, which makes them vulnerable to so-called side-channel attacks. The problem of secure computation in the presence of leakage is generally known as leakage resilience. In this work, we establish a connection between leakage resilience and fault-tolerant quantum computation. We first prove that for a general leakage model, there exists a corresponding noise model in which fault tolerance implies leakage resilience. Then we show how to use constructions for fault-tolerant quantum computation to implement classical circuits that are secure in specific leakage models.

> This paper address a new problem in RFID authentication research for the first time. That is, existing RFID authentication schemes generally assume that the backend server is absolutely secure, however, this assumption is rarely tenable in practical conditions. It disables existing RFID authentication protocols from being safely applied to a reallife scenario in which the backend server is actually vulnerable, compromised or even malicious itself. We propose an RFID authentication scheme against an unsecure backend server. It is based on hash chain, searching over encrypted data, and coprivacy, defending against the privacy revealing to the backend server. The proposed scheme is scalable, resistant to desynchronization attacks, and provides mutual authentication in only three frontend communication steps. Moreover, it is the first scheme meeting the special security and privacy requirement for a cloud-based RFID authentication scenario in which the backend server is untrustworthy to readers held by cloud clients.

> Telecare medicine information systems (TMIS) present the platform to deliver clinical service door to door. The technological advances in mobile computing are enhancing the quality of healthcare and a user can access these services using its mobile device. Existing authentication schemes for TMIS are either vulnerable to attacks or they have higher computational cost. We propose a biometric based efficient authentication scheme for TMIS which only requires the computation of the hash and XOR functions.

- `1405.0660v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0660v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0660v1)

> Modern cloud computing platforms based on virtual machine monitors carry a variety of complex business that present many network security vulnerabilities. At present, the traditional architecture employs a number of security devices at front-end of cloud computing to protect its network security. Under the new environment, however, this approach can not meet the needs of cloud security. New cloud security vendors and academia also made great efforts to solve network security of cloud computing, unfortunately, they also cannot provide a perfect and effective method to solve this problem. We introduce a novel network security architecture for cloud computing (NetSecCC) that addresses this problem. NetSecCC not only provides an effective solution for network security issues of cloud computing, but also greatly improves in scalability, fault-tolerant, resource utilization, etc. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype about NetSecCC and proved by experiments that NetSecCC is an effective architecture with minimal performance overhead that can be applied to the extensive practical promotion in cloud computing.

> Systems of systems (SoSs) are particularly vulnerable to faults and other threats to their dependability, but frequently inhabit domains that demand high levels of dependability. For this reason fault tolerance analysis is important in SoS engineering. The COMPASS project has previously proposed a Fault Tolerance Architecture Framework (FMAF), consisting of a collection of viewpoints that support systematic reasoning about faults in an SoS at the architectural level. The FMAF has been demonstrated previously with an analysis of an example fault in an emergency response SoS. In this paper we present further examples of the FMAF's practical use, by analysing different types of faults drawn from the same emergency response case study. These example faults exercise different aspects of the FMAF, demonstrate its use in more complex fault modelling scenarios, and raise new questions for further development.

> Critical Infrastructures (CIs), such as smart power grids, transport systems, and financial infrastructures, are more and more vulnerable to cyber threats, due to the adoption of commodity computing facilities. Despite the use of several monitoring tools, recent attacks have proven that current defensive mechanisms for CIs are not effective enough against most advanced threats. In this paper we explore the idea of a framework leveraging multiple data sources to improve protection capabilities of CIs. Challenges and opportunities are discussed along three main research directions: i) use of distinct and heterogeneous data sources, ii) monitoring with adaptive granularity, and iii) attack modeling and runtime combination of multiple data analysis techniques.

> The Kish key distribution system has been proposed as a class ical alternative to quantum key distribution. The idealized Kish scheme elegantly promise s secure key distribution by exploiting thermal noise in a transmission line. However, we demonstrate that it is vulnerable to nonidealities in its components, such as the finite resistance of the transmission line connecting its endpoints. We introduce a novel attack against this nonideality using directional wave measurements, and experimentally demonstrate its efficacy. Our attack is based on causality: in a spatially distributed system, propagation is needed for thermodynamic equilibration, and that leaks information.

> This paper studies a variant of the McEliece cryptosystem able to ensure that the code used as the public key is no longer permutation-equivalent to the secret code. This increases the security level of the public key, thus opening the way for reconsidering the adoption of classical families of codes, like Reed-Solomon codes, that have been longly excluded from the McEliece cryptosystem for security reasons. It is well known that codes of these classes are able to yield a reduction in the key size or, equivalently, an increased level of security against information set decoding; so, these are the main advantages of the proposed solution. We also describe possible vulnerabilities and attacks related to the considered system, and show what design choices are best suited to avoid them.

> Contactless technologies such as RFID, NFC, and sensor networks are vulnerable to mafia and distance frauds. Both frauds aim at passing an authentication protocol by cheating on the actual distance between the prover and the verifier. To cope these security issues, distance-bounding protocols have been designed. However, none of the current proposals simultaneously resists to these two frauds without requiring additional memory and computation. The situation is even worse considering that just a few distance-bounding protocols are able to deal with the inherent background noise on the communication channels. This article introduces a noise-resilient distance-bounding protocol that resists to both mafia and distance frauds. The security of the protocol is analyzed with respect to these two frauds in both scenarios, namely noisy and noiseless channels. Analytical expressions for the adversary's success probabilities are provided, and are illustrated by experimental results. The analysis, performed in an already existing framework for fairness reasons, demonstrates the undeniable advantage of the introduced lightweight design over the previous proposals.

<summary>2014-05-24 08:38:29 - A Sink-driven Approach to Detecting Exposed Component Vulnerabilities in Android Apps</summary>

- *Daoyuan Wu, Xiapu Luo, Rocky K. C. Chang*

- `1405.6282v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6282v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6282v1)

> Android apps could expose their components for cooperating with other apps. This convenience, however, makes apps susceptible to the exposed component vulnerability (ECV), in which a dangerous API (commonly known as sink) inside its component can be triggered by other (malicious) apps. In the prior works, detecting these ECVs use a set of sinks pertaining to the ECVs under detection. In this paper, we argue that a more comprehensive and effective approach should start by a systematic selection and classification of vulnerability-specific sinks (VSinks). The set of VSinks is much larger than those used in the previous works. Based on these VSinks, our sink-driven approach can detect different kinds of ECVs in an app in two steps. First, VSinks and their categories are identified through a typical forward reachability analysis. Second, based on each VSink's category, a corresponding detection method is used to identify the ECV via a customized backward dataflow analysis. We also design a semi-auto guided analysis and validation capability for system-only broadcast checking to remove some false positives. We implement our sink-driven approach in a tool called ECVDetector and evaluate it with the top 1K Android apps. Using ECVDetector we successfully identify a total of 49 vulnerable apps across all four ECV categories we have defined. To our knowledge, most of them are previously undisclosed, such as the very popular Go SMS Pro and Clean Master. Moreover, the performance of ECVDetector is high, requiring only 9.257 seconds on average to process each component.

> Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) consist of wireless mobile nodes which coordinate with each other to form temporary network without its pre-existing infrastructure. AODV is popular Ad-hoc distance vector routing reactive protocol which is used to find correct & shortest route to destination. Due to openness, dynamic, infrastructure-less nature, MANET are vulnerable to various attacks. One of these possible attacks is a Black Hole Attack in which a mobile node falsely replies to the source node that it is having a shortest path to the destination without checking its routing table. Therefore source node send all of its data to the black hole node and it deprives all the traffic of the source node. In this paper, We are proposing a technique to detect and prevent the multiple black hole nodes from MANET so that source to destination communication can be made easily. We also analysed the performance of the network in terms of number of packets sent, received, throughput, energy of network before attack and after detection & prevention of Attack. From these analysis, we can conclude that performance decreased due to attack can be improved after detection & prevention black hole attack in MANET.

- `1204.1216v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1216v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1216v3)

> Web applications require exchanging parameters between a client and a server to function properly. In real-world systems such as online banking transfer, traversing multiple pages with parameters contributed by both the user and server is a must, and hence the applications have to enforce workflow and parameter dependency controls across multiple requests. An application that applies insufficient server-side input validations is however vulnerable to parameter tampering attacks, which manipulate the exchanged parameters. Existing fuzzing-based scanning approaches however neglected these important controls, and this caused their fuzzing requests to be dropped before they can reach any vulnerable code.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identify the workflow and parameter dependent constraints, which are then maintained and leveraged for automatic detection of server acceptances during fuzzing. We realized the approach by building a generic blackbox parameter tampering scanner. It successfully uncovered a number of severe vulnerabilities, including one from the largest multi-national banking website, which other scanners miss.

> Motivated by the effectiveness of correlation attacks against Tor, the censorship arms race, and observations of malicious relays in Tor, we propose that Tor users capture their trust in network elements using probability distributions over the sets of elements observed by network adversaries. We present a modular system that allows users to efficiently and conveniently create such distributions and use them to improve their security. The major components of this system are (i) an ontology of network-element types that represents the main threats to and vulnerabilities of anonymous communication over Tor, (ii) a formal language that allows users to naturally express trust beliefs about network elements, and (iii) a conversion procedure that takes the ontology, public information about the network, and user beliefs written in the trust language and produce a Bayesian Belief Network that represents the probability distribution in a way that is concise and easily sampleable. We also present preliminary experimental results that show the distribution produced by our system can improve security when employed by users; further improvement is seen when the system is employed by both users and services.

In 2013, Yan proposed a biometric based remote user authentication scheme and claimed that his scheme is secure. Recently, Dheerendra et al. demonstrated some drawbacks in Yan et al scheme and proposed an improved scheme to erase the drawbacks of Yan et al scheme. We analyze Dheerendra et al scheme and identify that their scheme is vulnerable to off-line identity guessing attack, and on successfully mounting it, the attacker can perfom all major cryptographic attacks.

> Applications written in low-level languages without type or memory safety are especially prone to memory corruption. Attackers gain code execution capabilities through such applications despite all currently deployed defenses by exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities. Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is a promising defense mechanism that restricts open control-flow transfers to a static set of well-known locations. We present Lockdown, an approach to dynamic CFI that protects legacy, binary-only executables and libraries. Lockdown adaptively learns the control-flow graph of a running process using information from a trusted dynamic loader. The sandbox component of Lockdown restricts interactions between different shared objects to imported and exported functions by enforcing fine-grained CFI checks. Our prototype implementation shows that dynamic CFI results in low performance overhead.

> It is no longer a debate that quality is an essential requirement in any software product, especially in a highly competitive market and a context of mission critical product. To obtain better product quality, software metrics are the only reliable indicators provided to assess and measure this attribute of a software product. Several metrics have been elaborated but none of them were really convenient in an object oriented ecosystem. However, the MOOD metrics have proven their efficiency in gauging the software quality at system level, while CK Metrics measure the quality of software at class level . These metrics, well suited for Object-Oriented design, allow measuring object oriented design properties such as coupling, cohesion, encapsulation, Inheritance and polymorphism. The goal of the present study is using the mentioned metrics to assess the quality of two different case studies, MARF and GIPSY. For this purpose, different tools such as McCabe, Logiscope and, JDeodorant have been used to measure the quality of these projects by implementing in different manners the metrics composing the CK and MOOD suite metrics, whilst MARFCAT has been used to detect vulnerable code files in both case studies. The present study puts the light on the strengths of these tools to measure the quality of proven and largely researched software products.

We will first introduce the TLS protocol and its underlying components: X.509 certificates, ciphers, and protocol versions. Next we will have a look at TLS hardening for web servers, and how to plug various vulnerabilities: CRIME, BREACH, BEAST, session renegotiation, Heartbleed, and others. We will finally see how the know-how acquired on hardening web servers can be used for other protocols and tools such as Dovecot, Sendmail, SquirrelMail, RoundCube, and OpenVPN.

> Previous research about sensor based attacks on Android platform focused mainly on accessing or controlling over sensitive device components, such as camera, microphone and GPS. These approaches get data from sensors directly and need corresponding sensor invoking permissions.   This paper presents a novel approach (GVS-Attack) to launch permission bypassing attacks from a zero permission Android application (VoicEmployer) through the speaker. The idea of GVS-Attack utilizes an Android system built-in voice assistant module -- Google Voice Search. Through Android Intent mechanism, VoicEmployer triggers Google Voice Search to the foreground, and then plays prepared audio files (like "call number 1234 5678") in the background. Google Voice Search can recognize this voice command and execute corresponding operations. With ingenious designs, our GVS-Attack can forge SMS/Email, access privacy information, transmit sensitive data and achieve remote control without any permission.   Also we found a vulnerability of status checking in Google Search app, which can be utilized by GVS-Attack to dial arbitrary numbers even when the phone is securely locked with password. A prototype of VoicEmployer has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of GVS-Attack in real world. In theory, nearly all Android devices equipped with Google Services Framework can be affected by GVS-Attack. This study may inspire application developers and researchers rethink that zero permission doesn't mean safety and the speaker can be treated as a new attack surface.

> Conventional cryptography methods alone are not adequate for secure routing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). These networks are more vulnerable to security attacks due to their diverse applications, lack of supervision and limitations in view of resource, processing and storage. To mitigate these problems, trust is widely used as a tool to provide better security by aiding routing protocols. In recent years, numerous researchers have proposed wide variety of solutions based on trust. However, all these solutions carry their own design. In this paper, we attempt to present steps for a systematic design of trust management systems for WSNs. In addition, we address the techniques followed by scholars in implementing trust frameworks. Furthermore, we provide discussion on state-of-the-art research in designing trust systems with summary and comparisons.

> Users often choose passwords that are easy to remember but also easy to guess by attackers. Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of textual passwords to shoulder surfing and keystroke loggers. It remains a critical challenge in password research to develop an authentication scheme that addresses these security issues, in addition to offering good memorability. Motivated by psychology research on humans' cognitive strengths and weaknesses, we explore the potential of cognitive questions as a way to address the major challenges in user authentication. We design, implement, and evaluate Q-A, a novel cognitive-question-based password system that requires a user to enter the letter at a given position in her answer for each of six personal questions (e.g. "What is the name of your favorite childhood teacher?"). In this scheme, the user does not need to memorize new, artificial information as her authentication secret. Our scheme offers 28 bits of theoretical password space, which has been found sufficient to prevent online brute-force attacks. Q-A is also robust against shoulder surfing and keystroke loggers. We conducted a multi-session in-lab user study to evaluate the usability of Q-A; 100% of users were able to remember their Q-A password over the span of one week, although login times were high. We compared our scheme with random six character passwords and found that login success rate in Q-A was significantly higher. Based on our results, we suggest that Q-A would be most appropriate in contexts that demand high security and where logins occur infrequently (e.g., online bank accounts).

> Ubiquitous computing allows to make data and services within the reach of users anytime and anywhere. This makes ubiquitous networks vulnerable to attacks coming from either inside or outside the network. To ensure and enhance networks security, several solutions have been implemented. These solutions are inefficient and or incomplete. Solving these challenges in security with new requirement of Ubicomp, could provide a potential future for such systems towards better mobility and higher confidence level of end user services. We investigate the possibility to detect network intrusions, based on security nodes abilities. Specifically, we show how authentication can help build user profiles in each network node. Authentication is based on permissions and restrictions to access to information and services on ubiquitous network. As a result, our idea realizes a protection of nodes and assures security of network.

> Off-Chain transactions allow for the immediate transfer of Cryptocurrency between two parties, without delays or unavoidable transaction fees. Such capabilities are critical for mainstream Cryptocurrency adaption. They allow for the "Coffee-Coin Criteria"; under which a customer orders a coffee and pays for that coffee in bitcoins. This is not possible with On-Chain transactions today. Unfortunately, all existing Off-Chain transaction protocols are notoriously unreliable The current generation of third-party facilitators are vulnerable to hacker-based attacks. As Mt. Gox tragically demonstrated, centralized-transaction institutions are easy targets for Cryptocurrency thieves. The slightest security flaw in a third-party system will pounced on by hackers, who will proceed to devour it like ants devouring a crab. Under such circumstances, it no wonder that the Public treats most Cryptocurrency services with a constant shadow of suspicion. For Bitcoin to flourish, its anti-hierarchy principles must be applied to safe Off-Chain transactions. First and foremost, we need a new hacker-proof protocol that can easily be executed by any experienced developer. Preferably, the protocol will be open-sourced for full reliability and transparency. This paper presents one such procedure, which allows for he safe transmission of Bitcoin private key control by way of Cryptocubic transactions.

This leads to less secure systems, as the security mechanisms are only applied as an afterthought and therefore do not integrate well with the rest of the design. Also, several statistics about discovered vulnerabilities in existing systems suggest, that most of the vulnerabilities of a system are not caused by errors in the cryptographic primitives, but in other parts of the implementation. So integrating security concerns early in the design process seems a promising approach for increasing the security of the resulting system.   This work evaluates how the choice of the architectural style affects the security of the resulting system. The evaluation is done on the example of an existing certification authority (CA). The requirements for the system are gathered and multiple designs according to different architectural styles are drafted and evaluated using a risk evaluation method. Then the evaluated designs are compared to find out whether there are significant differences.

> The recent financial crisis have generated renewed interests in fragilities of global financial networks among economists and regulatory authorities. In particular, a potential vulnerability of the financial networks is the "financial contagion" process in which insolvencies of individual entities propagate through the "web of dependencies" to affect the entire system. In this paper, we formalize an extension of a financial network model originally proposed by Nier et al. for scenarios such as the OTC derivatives market, define a suitable global stability measure for this model, and perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of this stability measure over more than 700,000 combinations of networks types and parameter combinations. Based on our evaluations, we discover many interesting implications of our evaluations of this stability measure, and derive topological properties and parameters combinations that may be used to flag the network as a possible fragile network. An interactive software FIN-STAB for computing the stability is available from the website www2.cs.uic.edu/~dasgupta/financial-simulator-files

> By offering sophisticated services and centralizing a huge volume of personal data, modern smartphones changed the way we socialize, entertain and work. To this aim, they rely upon complex hardware/software frameworks leading to a number of vulnerabilities, attacks and hazards to profile individuals or gather sensitive information. However, the majority of works evaluating the security degree of smartphones neglects steganography, which can be mainly used to: i) exfiltrate confidential data via camouflage methods, and ii) conceal valuable or personal information into innocent looking carriers.   Therefore, this paper surveys the state of the art of steganographic techniques for smartphones, with emphasis on methods developed over the period 2005 to the second quarter of 2014. The different approaches are grouped according to the portion of the device used to hide information, leading to three different covert channels, i.e., local, object and network. Also, it reviews the relevant approaches used to detect and mitigate steganographic attacks or threats. Lastly, it showcases the most popular software applications to embed secret data into carriers, as well as possible future directions.

> Recently, spectrum sharing has been considered as a promising solution to improve the spectrum utilization. It however may be vulnerable to security problems as the primary and secondary network access the same resource. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of a cognitive radio network in the presence of an eavesdropper (EAV) who illegally listens to the primary user (PU) communication in which the transmit power of the secondary transmitter (SU-Tx) is subject to the joint constraint of peak transmit power of the SU-Tx and outage probability of the PU. Accordingly, an adaptive transmit power policy and an analytical expression of symbol error probability are derived for the SU. Most importantly, security evaluations of primary network in terms of the probability of existence of non-zero secrecy capacity and outage probability of secrecy capacity are obtained. Numerical results reveal a fact that the security of the primary network does not only depends on the channel mean powers between primary and secondary networks, but also strongly depends on the channel condition of the SU-Tx to EAV link and transmit power policy of the SU-Tx.

> After 38 years of birthday Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE), there are many proposed improvements in the DHKE protocol to encounter modern security issues. This protocol seems quite simple to be implemented, but it can be vulnerable to many types of attacks. In this work, we propose the Chained Key Exchange scheme as a case study to explore cryptographic computation capability of embedded microcontroller. We choose ARM RaspberryPi board as hardware platform for experimental setup. To enable RasberberryPi system on chip (SoC) to perform cryptographic computation, we modified the GNU GMP Bignum library to support a simple primitive cryptographic computation in the UBOOT firmware. The main purpose of our study is to determine whether there is any gap between cryptographic protocol-scheme (in term of theoretical) and its engineering implementation. Our scheme will be integrated with Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) application in the UBOOT firmware. Our proposed scheme in the TFTP protocol will secure the sharing of secrets and symmetric keys (e.g., AES256). After that, the symmetric encryption algorithm can be used to encrypt data in the cases of remote system updates, patching and upgrades (e.g., firmware, kernel or application).

> Securing browsers in mobile devices is very challenging, because these browser apps usually provide browsing services to other apps in the same device. A malicious app installed in a device can potentially obtain sensitive information through a browser app. In this paper, we identify four types of attacks in Android, collectively known as FileCross, that exploits the vulnerable file:// to obtain users' private files, such as cookies, bookmarks, and browsing histories. We design an automated system to dynamically test 115 browser apps collected from Google Play and find that 64 of them are vulnerable to the attacks. Among them are the popular Firefox, Baidu and Maxthon browsers, and the more application-specific ones, including UC Browser HD for tablet users, Wikipedia Browser, and Kids Safe Browser. A detailed analysis of these browsers further shows that 26 browsers (23%) expose their browsing interfaces unintentionally. In response to our reports, the developers concerned promptly patched their browsers by forbidding file:// access to private file zones, disabling JavaScript execution in file:// URLs, or even blocking external file:// URLs. We employ the same system to validate the ten patches received from the developers and find one still failing to block the vulnerability.

> We develop the first basic Operational Risk perspective on key risk management issues associated with the development of new forms of electronic currency in the real economy. In particular, we focus on understanding the development of new risks types and the evolution of current risk types as new components of financial institutions arise to cater for an increasing demand for electronic money, micro-payment systems, Virtual money and cryptographic (Crypto) currencies. In particular, this paper proposes a framework of risk identification and assessment applied to Virtual and Crypto currencies from a banking regulation perspective. In doing so, it addresses the topical issues of understanding important key Operational Risk vulnerabilities and exposure risk drivers under the framework of the Basel II/III banking regulation, specifically associated with Virtual and Crypto currencies. This is critical to consider should such alternative currencies continue to grow in utilisation to the point that they enter into the banking sector, through commercial banks and financial institutions who are beginning to contemplate their recognition in terms of deposits, transactions and exchangeability for fiat currencies.   We highlight how some of the features of Virtual and Crypto currencies are important drivers of Operational Risk, posing both management and regulatory challenges that must start to be considered and addressed both by regulators, central banks and security exchanges. In this paper we focus purely on the Operational Risk perspective of banks operating in an environment where such electronic Virtual currencies are available. Some aspects of this discussion are directly relevant now, whilst others can be understood as discussions to raise awareness of issues in Operational Risk that will arise as Virtual currency start to interact more widely in the real economy.

> Traditionally, 802.11-based networks that relied on wired equivalent protocol (WEP) were especially vulnerable to packet sniffing. Today, wireless networks are more prolific, and the monitoring devices used to find them are mobile and easy to access. Securing wireless networks can be difficult because these networks consist of radio transmitters and receivers, and anybody can listen, capture data and attempt to compromise it. In recent years, a range of technologies and mechanisms have helped make networking more secure. This paper holistically evaluated various enhanced protocols proposed to solve WEP related authentication, confidentiality and integrity problems. It discovered that strength of each solution depends on how well the encryption, authentication and integrity techniques work. The work suggested using a Defence-in-Depth Strategy and integration of biometric solution in 802.11i. Comprehensive in-depth comparative analysis of each of the security mechanisms is driven by review of related work in WLAN security solutions.

> Active security is mainly concerned with performing one or more security functions when a host in a communication network is subject to an attack. Such security functions include appropriate actions against attackers. To properly afford active security actions a set of software subsystems should be integrated together so that they can automatically detect and appropriately address any vulnerability in the underlying network. This work presents integrated model for active security response model. The proposed model introduces Active Response Mechanism (ARM) for tracing anonymous attacks in the network back to their source. This work is motivated by the increased frequency and sophistication of denial-of-service attacks and by the difficulty in tracing packets with incorrect, or "spoofed", source addresses. This paper presents within the proposed model two tracing approaches based on:   1.Sleepy Watermark Tracing (SWT) for unauthorized access attacks.   2.Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM) in the network for Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. On the basis of the proposed model a cooperative network security tools such as firewall, intrusion detection system with IP tracing mechanism has been designed for taking a rapid active response against real IPs for attackers. The proposed model is able to detect network vulnerabilities, trace attack source IP and reconfigure the attacked subnetworks.

> Modern virtualized service infrastructures expose attack vectors that enable attacks of high severity, such as attacks targeting hypervisors. A malicious user of a guest VM (virtual machine) may execute an attack against the underlying hypervisor via hypercalls, which are software traps from a kernel of a fully or partially paravirtualized guest VM to the hypervisor. The exploitation of a vulnerability of a hypercall handler may have severe consequences such as altering hypervisor's memory, which may result in the execution of malicious code with hypervisor privilege. Despite the importance of vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers, there is not much publicly available information on them. This significantly hinders advances towards securing hypercall interfaces. In this work, we provide in-depth technical information on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers. Our vulnerability analysis is based on reverse engineering the released patches fixing the considered vulnerabilities. For each analyzed vulnerability, we provide background information essential for understanding the vulnerability, and information on the vulnerable hypercall handler and the error causing the vulnerability. We also show how the vulnerability can be triggered and discuss the state of the targeted hypervisor after the vulnerability has been triggered.

> ZigBee has been recently drawing a lot of attention as a promising solution for ubiquitous computing. The ZigBee devices are normally resource-limited, making the network susceptible to a variety of security threats. This paper presents a severe attack on ZigBee networks termed as ghost, which leverages the underlying vulnerabilities of the IEEE 802.15.4 security suites to deplete the energy of the devices. We manifest that the impact of ghost is severe as it can reduce the lifetime of devices from years to days and facilitate a variety of threats including denial of service and replay attacks. We highlight that merely deploying a standard suite of advanced security techniques does not necessarily guarantee improved security, but instead might be leveraged by adversaries to cause severe disruption in the network. We propose several recommendations on how to localize and withstand the ghost and other related attacks in ZigBee networks. Extensive simulations are provided to show the impact of the ghost and the performance of the proposed recommendations. Moreover, physical experiments also have been conducted and the observations confirm the severity of the impact by the ghost attack. We believe that the presented work will aid the researchers to improve the security of ZigBee further.

> Wireless ad hoc networks have gained lots of attention due to their ease and low cost of deployment. This has made ad hoc networks of great importance in numerous military and civilian applications. But, the lack of centralized management of these networks makes them vulnerable to a number of security attacks. One of the attacks is packet drop attack, where a compromised node drops packets maliciously. Several techniques have been proposed to detect the packet drop attack in wireless ad hoc networks. Therefore, in this paper we review some of the packet drop attack detection techniques and comparatively analyze them basing on; their ability to detect the attack under different attack strategies (partial and or cooperate attacks), environments and the computational and communication overheads caused in the process of detection.

> In the past years technological advances such as the increasing bandwidth in network infrastructures and new software developments such as message and agent-based systems gave rise to the field of cloud technologies, which have evolved from abstract concepts to concrete solutions, ranging from flexible, platform-independent systems to highly specialized software solutions. In this paper we introduce and evaluate two anomaly detection methods to achieve a higher level of security in a specific cloud solution for interactive media, the Media Cloud from Alcatel-Lucent. The Media Cloud focuses on real-time processing of interactive media applications, allowing for optimal resource planning using highly specific functional components. The proposed anomaly detection methods are designed to work complimentary to each other and are capable of detecting known and unknown vulnerabilities and security issues, offering very low false positive rates and very high detection rates, as is shown by the evaluation on real Media Cloud data and synthetic data. The proposed methods use behavioral and structural features, and are capable of locating the detected anomalies as well, giving the executing analyst easy insight into the running processes.

> Since the first publication of the "OWASP Top 10" (2004), cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have always been among the top 5 web application security bugs. Black-box vulnerability scanners are widely used in the industry to reproduce (XSS) attacks automatically. In spite of the technical sophistication and advancement, previous work showed that black-box scanners miss a non-negligible portion of vulnerabilities, and report non-existing, non-exploitable or uninteresting vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, these results hold true even for XSS vulnerabilities, which are relatively simple to trigger if compared, for instance, to logic flaws.   Black-box scanners have not been studied in depth on this vertical: knowing precisely how scanners try to detect XSS can provide useful insights to understand their limitations, to design better detection methods. In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a detailed and systematic study on 6 black-box web scanners (both proprietary and open source) that we conducted in coordination with the respective vendors. To this end, we developed an automated tool to (1) extract the payloads used by each scanner, (2) distill the "templates" that have originated each payload, (3) evaluate them according to quality indicators, and (4) perform a cross-scanner analysis. Unlike previous work, our testbed application, which contains a large set of XSS vulnerabilities, including DOM XSS, was gradually retrofitted to accomodate for the payloads that triggered no vulnerabilities.   Our analysis reveals a highly fragmented scenario. Scanners exhibit a wide variety of distinct payloads, a non-uniform approach to fuzzing and mutating the payloads, and a very diverse detection effectiveness.

> Research in information security has generally focused on providing a comprehensive interpretation of threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks, in particular to evaluate their danger and prioritize responses accordingly. Most of the current approaches propose advanced techniques to detect intrusions and complex attacks but few of these approaches propose well defined methodologies to react against a given attack. In this paper, we propose a novel and systematic method to select security countermeasures from a pool of candidates, by ranking them based on the technical and financial impact associated to each alternative. The method includes industrial evaluation and simulations of the impact associated to a given security measure which allows to compute the return on response investment for different candidates. A simple case study is proposed at the end of the paper to show the applicability of the model.

> A Cardiac Implantable Medical device (IMD) is a device, which is surgically implanted into a patient's body, and wirelessly configured using an external programmer by prescribing physicians and doctors. A set of lethal attacks targeting these devices can be conducted due to the use of vulnerable wireless communication and security protocols, and the lack of security protection mechanisms deployed on IMDs. In this paper, we propose a system for postmortem analysis of lethal attack scenarios targeting cardiac IMDs. Such a system reconciles in the same framework conclusions derived by technical investigators and deductions generated by pathologists. An inference system integrating a library of medical rules is used to automatically infer potential medical scenarios that could have led to the death of a patient. A Model Checking based formal technique allowing the reconstruction of potential technical attack scenarios on the IMD, starting from the collected evidence, is also proposed. A correlation between the results obtained by the two techniques allows to prove whether a potential attack scenario is the source of the patient's death.

> Computing platforms such as smartphones frequently access Web content using many separate applications rather than a single Web browser application. These applications often deal with sensitive user information such as financial data or passwords, and use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to protect it from unauthorized eavesdropping. However, recent studies have confirmed a wide-spread misconfiguration of SSL verification in applications. This paper considers the difficulty faced by Android application developers when modifying SSL code for using common features like pinning or using a self-signed SSL certificate. For example, developing an application that accesses a test Web server with a self-signed certificate requires additional code to remove SSL verification; however, this code is not always removed in production versions of the application. To mitigate vulnerabilities introduced because of the complexity of customizing SSL code in Android applications, we propose that common SSL configuration should be specified in the application's package manifest. We provide two concrete suggestions: 1) linking the application's debug state to SSL verification, and 2) pinning certificates and CAs in the manifest. We evaluate the appropriateness of these two suggestions on over 13,000 applications from Google's Play Store, of which 3,302 use SSL in non-advertisement code, and find that 1,889 (57.20%) of these SSL applications would benefit.

> Expecting the shipment of 1 billion Android devices in 2017, cyber criminals have naturally extended their vicious activities towards Google's mobile operating system. With an estimated number of 700 new Android applications released every day, keeping control over malware is an increasingly challenging task. In recent years, a vast number of static and dynamic code analysis platforms for analyzing Android applications and making decision regarding their maliciousness have been introduced in academia and in the commercial world. These platforms differ heavily in terms of feature support and application properties being analyzed. In this paper, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art dynamic code analysis platforms for Android and evaluate their effectiveness with samples from known malware corpora as well as known Android bugs like Master Key. Our results indicate a low level of diversity in analysis platforms resulting from code reuse that leaves the evaluated systems vulnerable to evasion. Furthermore the Master Key bugs could be exploited by malware to hide malicious behavior from the sandboxes.

> Like many desktop operating systems in the 1990s, Android is now in the process of including support for multi-user scenarios. Because these scenarios introduce new threats to the system, we should have an understanding of how well the system design addresses them. Since the security implications of multi-user support are truly pervasive, we developed a systematic approach to studying the system and identifying problems. Unlike other approaches that focus on specific attacks or threat models, ours systematically identifies critical places where access controls are not present or do not properly identify the subject and object of a decision. Finding these places gives us insight into hypothetical attacks that could result, and allows us to design specific experiments to test our hypothesis.   Following an overview of the new features and their implementation, we describe our methodology, present a partial list of our most interesting hypotheses, and describe the experiments we used to test them. Our findings indicate that the current system only partially addresses the new threats, leaving the door open to a number of significant vulnerabilities and privacy issues. Our findings span a spectrum of root causes, from simple oversights, all the way to major system design problems. We conclude that there is still a long way to go before the system can be used in anything more than the most casual of sharing environments.

> With Firefox OS, Mozilla is making a serious push for an HTML5-based mobile platform. In order to assuage security concerns over providing hardware access to web applications, Mozilla has introduced a number of mechanisms that make the security landscape of Firefox OS distinct from both the desktop web and other mobile operating systems. From an application security perspective, the two most significant of these mechanisms are the the introduction of a default Content Security Policy and code review in the market. This paper describes how lightweight static analysis can augment these mechanisms to find vulnerabilities which have otherwise been missed. We provide examples of privileged applications in the market that contain vulnerabilities that can be automatically detected.   In addition to these findings, we show some of the challenges that occur when desktop software is repurposed for a mobile operating system. In particular, we argue that the caching of certificate overrides across applications--a known problem in Firefox OS--generates a counter-intuitive user experience that detracts from the security of the system.

> HTML5-based mobile apps become more and more popular, mostly because they are much easier to be ported across different mobile platforms than native apps. HTML5-based apps are implemented using the standard web technologies, including HTML5, JavaScript and CSS; they depend on some middlewares, such as PhoneGap, to interact with the underlying OS.   Knowing that JavaScript is subject to code injection attacks, we have conducted a systematic study on HTML5-based mobile apps, trying to evaluate whether it is safe to rely on the web technologies for mobile app development. Our discoveries are quite surprising. We found out that if HTML5-based mobile apps become popular--it seems to go that direction based on the current projection--many of the things that we normally do today may become dangerous, including reading from 2D barcodes, scanning Wi-Fi access points, playing MP4 videos, pairing with Bluetooth devices, etc. This paper describes how HTML5-based apps can become vulnerable, how attackers can exploit their vulnerabilities through a variety of channels, and what damage can be achieved by the attackers. In addition to demonstrating the attacks through example apps, we have studied 186 PhoneGap plugins, used by apps to achieve a variety of functionalities, and we found that 11 are vulnerable. We also found two real HTML5-based apps that are vulnerable to the attacks.

> Mobile networks are vulnerable to signalling attacks and storms that are caused by traffic patterns that overload the control plane, and differ from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet since they directly attack the control plane, and also reserve wireless bandwidth without actually using it. Such attacks can result from malware and mobile botnets, as well as from poorly designed applications, and can cause service outages in 3G and 4G networks which have been experienced by mobile operators. Since the radio resource control (RRC) protocol in 3G and 4G networks is particularly susceptible to such attacks, we analyze their effect with a mathematical model that helps to predict the congestion that is caused by an attack. A detailed simulation model of a mobile network is used to better understand the temporal dynamics of user behavior and signalling in the network and to show how RRC based signalling attacks and storms cause significant problems in the control plane and the user plane of the network. Our analysis also serves to identify how storms can be detected, and to propose how system parameters can be chosen to mitigate their effect.

> With millions of apps that can be downloaded from official or third-party market, Android has become one of the most popular mobile platforms today. These apps help people in all kinds of ways and thus have access to lots of user's data that in general fall into three categories: sensitive data, data to be shared with other apps, and non-sensitive data not to be shared with others. For the first and second type of data, Android has provided very good storage models: an app's private sensitive data are saved to its private folder that can only be access by the app itself, and the data to be shared are saved to public storage (either the external SD card or the emulated SD card area on internal FLASH memory). But for the last type, i.e., an app's non-sensitive and non-shared data, there is a big problem in Android's current storage model which essentially encourages an app to save its non-sensitive data to shared public storage that can be accessed by other apps. At first glance, it seems no problem to do so, as those data are non-sensitive after all, but it implicitly assumes that app developers could correctly identify all sensitive data and prevent all possible information leakage from private-but-non-sensitive data. In this paper, we will demonstrate that this is an invalid assumption with a thorough survey on information leaks of those apps that had followed Android's recommended storage model for non-sensitive data. Our studies showed that highly sensitive information from billions of users can be easily hacked by exploiting the mentioned problematic storage model. Although our empirical studies are based on a limited set of apps, the identified problems are never isolated or accidental bugs of those apps being investigated. On the contrary, the problem is rooted from the vulnerable storage model recommended by Android. To mitigate the threat, we also propose a defense framework.

> In recent years, Information Security has become a notable issue in the energy sector. After the invention of The Stuxnet worm in 2010, data integrity, privacy and confidentiality has received significant importance in the real-time operation of the control centres. New methods and frameworks are being developed to protect the National Critical Infrastructures like energy sector. In the recent literatures, it has been shown that the key real-time operational tools (e.g., State Estimator) of any Energy Management System (EMS) are vulnerable to Cyber Attacks. In this chapter, one such cyber attack named False Data Injection Attack is discussed. A literature review with a case study is considered to explain the characteristics and significance of such data integrity attacks.

> Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) bring together a global crowd of thousands of learners for several weeks or months. In theory, the openness and scale of MOOCs can promote iterative dialogue that facilitates group cognition and knowledge construction. Using data from two successive instances of a popular business strategy MOOC, we filter observed communication patterns to arrive at the "significant" interaction networks between learners and use complex network analysis to explore the vulnerability and information diffusion potential of the discussion forums. We find that different discussion topics and pedagogical practices promote varying levels of 1) "significant" peer-to-peer engagement, 2) participant inclusiveness in dialogue, and ultimately, 3) modularity, which impacts information diffusion to prevent a truly "global" exchange of knowledge and learning. These results indicate the structural limitations of large-scale crowd-based learning and highlight the different ways that learners in MOOCs leverage, and learn within, social contexts. We conclude by exploring how these insights may inspire new developments in online education.

> Secure communication over a wiretap channel is considered in the disadvantaged wireless environment, where the eavesdropper channel is (possibly much) better than the main channel. We present a method to exploit inherent vulnerabilities of the eavesdropper's receiver to obtain everlasting secrecy. Based on an ephemeral cryptographic key pre-shared between the transmitter Alice and the intended recipient Bob, a random jamming signal is added to each symbol. Bob can subtract the jamming signal before recording the signal, while the eavesdropper Eve is forced to perform these non-commutative operations in the opposite order. Thus, information-theoretic secrecy can be obtained, hence achieving the goal of converting the vulnerable "cheap" cryptographic secret key bits into "valuable" information-theoretic (i.e. everlasting) secure bits. We evaluate the achievable secrecy rates for different settings, and show that, even when the eavesdropper has perfect access to the output of the transmitter (albeit through an imperfect analog-to-digital converter), the method can still achieve a positive secrecy rate. Next we consider a wideband system, where Alice and Bob perform frequency hopping in addition to adding the random jamming to the signal, and we show the utility of such an approach even in the face of substantial eavesdropper hardware capabilities.

> In this article, virtualization security concerns in the cloud computing domain are reviewed. The focus is toward virtual machine (VM) security where attacks and vulnerabilities such as VM escape, VM hopping, cross-VM side-channel, VM-based rootkits (VMBRs), VM mobility, and VM remote are mentioned and discussed according to their relevance in the clouds. For each attack we outline how they affect the security of cloud systems. Countermeasures and security measures to detect or prevent them through techniques such as VM detection, GuardHype, VM introspection, VM image scanning, etc. are also discussed. Through the surveyed work we present a classification of VM threats within the clouds. Finally, we include our observations and those of other researchers on this matter of cloud virtualization security.

> Discovering the malicious or vulnerable anchor node is an essential problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In wireless sensor networks, anchor nodes are the nodes that know its current location. Neighbouring nodes or non-anchor nodes calculate its location coordinate (or location reference) with the help of anchor nodes. Ingenuous localization is not possible in the presence of a cheating anchor node or a cheating node. Nowadays, its a challenging task to identify the cheating anchor node or cheating node in a network. Even after finding out the location of the cheating anchor node, there is no assurance, that the identified node is legitimate or not. This paper aims to localize the cheating anchor nodes using trilateration algorithm and later associate it with Mahalanobis distance to obtain maximum accuracy in detecting malicious or cheating anchor nodes during localization. We were able to attain a considerable reduction in the error achieved during localization. For implementation purpose, we simulated our scheme using ns3 network simulator.

> Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied to dimensionality reduction and data pre-processing for different applications in engineering, biology and social science. Classical PCA and its variants seek for linear projections of the original variables to obtain a low dimensional feature representation with maximal variance. One limitation is that it is very difficult to interpret the results of PCA. In addition, the classical PCA is vulnerable to certain noisy data. In this paper, we propose a convex sparse principal component analysis (CSPCA) algorithm and apply it to feature analysis. First we show that PCA can be formulated as a low-rank regression optimization problem. Based on the discussion, the l 2 , 1 -norm minimization is incorporated into the objective function to make the regression coefficients sparse, thereby robust to the outliers. In addition, based on the sparse model used in CSPCA, an optimal weight is assigned to each of the original feature, which in turn provides the output with good interpretability. With the output of our CSPCA, we can effectively analyze the importance of each feature under the PCA criteria. The objective function is convex, and we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize it. We apply the CSPCA algorithm to feature selection and conduct extensive experiments on six different benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection algorithms.

> By developing communications and increase of access points, computer networks have been vulnerable considerably against wide range of information attacks, specially new and complicated attacks. Every day, replication attacks attack millions of network and mobile users. Increase in amount of replication attack may be a potential danger for income of SMS or network and causes losing customers of these services provider. Humans or software can be used to encounter these replication attacks. It is obvious that lonely absolute use of each method will not result in a proper answer to encounter replication attack`s problem. Since replication attack is one of the important problems of information protection and security in organizations for computer and mobile phone users, while reviewing types of replication attacks and methods of encountering, this paper uses similarities between pathologies in body and invader factors in replication attacks, a model is provided based on biological simulation methods existing in body`s adapted immune system to encounter these threats.

> Single Sign-On (SSO) systems simplify login procedures by using an an Identity Provider (IdP) to issue authentication tokens which can be consumed by Service Providers (SPs). Traditionally, IdPs are modeled as trusted third parties. This is reasonable for SSO systems like Kerberos, MS Passport and SAML, where each SP explicitely specifies which IdP he trusts. However, in open systems like OpenID and OpenID Connect, each user may set up his own IdP, and a discovery phase is added to the protocol flow. Thus it is easy for an attacker to set up its own IdP. In this paper we use a novel approach for analyzing SSO authentication schemes by introducing a malicious IdP. With this approach we evaluate one of the most popular and widely deployed SSO protocols - OpenID. We found four novel attack classes on OpenID, which were not covered by previous research, and show their applicability to real-life implementations. As a result, we were able to compromise 11 out of 16 existing OpenID implementations like Sourceforge, Drupal and ownCloud. We automated discovery of these attacks in a open source tool OpenID Attacker, which additionally allows fine-granular testing of all parameters in OpenID implementations. Our research helps to better understand the message flow in the OpenID protocol, trust assumptions in the different components of the system, and implementation issues in OpenID components. It is applicable to other SSO systems like OpenID Connect and SAML. All OpenID implementations have been informed about their vulnerabilities and we supported them in fixing the issues.

> With the phenomenal growth in the Internet, network security has become an integral part of computer and information security. In order to come up with measures that make networks more secure, it is important to learn about the vulnerabilities that could exist in a computer network and then have an understanding of the typical attacks that have been carried out in such networks. The first half of this paper will expose the readers to the classical network attacks that have exploited the typical vulnerabilities of computer networks in the past and solutions that have been adopted since then to prevent or reduce the chances of some of these attacks. The second half of the paper will expose the readers to the different network security controls including the network architecture, protocols, standards and software/ hardware tools that have been adopted in modern day computer networks.

> In this paper we revisit some major orthodoxies which lie at the heart of the bitcoin crypto currency and its numerous clones. In particular we look at The Longest Chain Rule, the monetary supply policies and the exact mechanisms which implement them. We claim that these built-in properties are not as brilliant as they are sometimes claimed. A closer examination reveals that they are closer to being... engineering mistakes which other crypto currencies have copied rather blindly. More precisely we show that the capacity of current crypto currencies to resist double spending attacks is poor and most current crypto currencies are highly vulnerable. Satoshi did not implement a timestamp for bitcoin transactions and the bitcoin software does not attempt to monitor double spending events. As a result major attacks involving hundreds of millions of dollars can occur and would not even be recorded. Hundreds of millions have been invested to pay for ASIC hashing infrastructure yet insufficient attention was paid to network neutrality and to insure that the protection layer it promises is effective and cannot be abused. In this paper we develop a theory of Programmed Self-Destruction of crypto currencies. We observe that most crypto currencies have mandated abrupt and sudden transitions. These affect their hash rate and therefore their protection against double spending attacks which we do not limit the to the notion of 51% attacks which is highly misleading. In addition we show that smaller bitcoin competitors are substantially more vulnerable. In addition to small hash rate, many bitcoin competitors mandate incredibly important adjustments in miner reward. We exhibit examples of 'alt-coins' which validate our theory and for which the process of programmed decline and rapid self-destruction has clearly already started.

> Good quality entropy sources are indispensable in most modern cryptographic protocols. Unfortunately, many currently deployed networked devices do not include them and may be vulnerable to Random Number Generator (RNG) attacks. Since most of these systems allow firmware upgrades and have serial communication facilities, the potential for retrofitting them with secure hardware-based entropy sources exists. To this aim, very low-cost, robust, easy to deploy solutions are required. Here, a retrofittable, sub 10$ entropy source based on chaotic dynamics is illustrated, capable of a 32 kbit/s rate or more and offering multiple serial communication options including USB, I2C, SPI or USART. Operation is based on a loop built around the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) hosted on a standard microcontroller.

> The policy objective of safeguarding financial stability has stimulated a wave of research on systemic risk analytics, yet it still faces challenges in measurability. This paper models systemic risk by tapping into expert knowledge of financial supervisors. We decompose systemic risk into a number of interconnected segments, for which the level of vulnerability is measured. The system is modeled in the form of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), in which nodes represent vulnerability in segments and links their interconnectedness. A main problem tackled in this paper is the aggregation of values in different interrelated nodes of the network to obtain an estimate systemic risk. To this end, the Choquet integral is employed for aggregating expert evaluations of measures, as it allows for the integration of interrelations among factors in the aggregation process. The approach is illustrated through two applications in a European setting. First, we provide an estimation of systemic risk with a of pan-European set-up. Second, we estimate country-level risks, allowing for a more granular decomposition. This sets a starting point for the use of the rich, oftentimes tacit, knowledge in policy organizations.
