> Harvard architecture CPU design is common in the embedded world. Examples of Harvard-based architecture devices are the Mica family of wireless sensors. Mica motes have limited memory and can process only very small packets. Stack-based buffer overflow techniques that inject code into the stack and then execute it are therefore not applicable. It has been a common belief that code injection is impossible on Harvard architectures. This paper presents a remote code injection attack for Mica sensors. We show how to exploit program vulnerabilities to permanently inject any piece of code into the program memory of an Atmel AVR-based sensor. To our knowledge, this is the first result that presents a code injection technique for such devices. Previous work only succeeded in injecting data or performing transient attacks. Injecting permanent code is more powerful since the attacker can gain full control of the target sensor. We also show that this attack can be used to inject a worm that can propagate through the wireless sensor network and possibly create a sensor botnet. Our attack combines different techniques such as return oriented programming and fake stack injection. We present implementation details and suggest some counter-measures.

> We consider large-scale sensor networks with n nodes, out of which k are in possession, (e.g., have sensed or collected in some other way) k information packets. In the scenarios in which network nodes are vulnerable because of, for example, limited energy or a hostile environment, it is desirable to disseminate the acquired information throughout the network so that each of the n nodes stores one (possibly coded) packet and the original k source packets can be recovered later in a computationally simple way from any (1 + \epsilon)k nodes for some small \epsilon > 0.   We developed two distributed algorithms for solving this problem based on simple random walks and Fountain codes. Unlike all previously developed schemes, our solution is truly distributed, that is, nodes do not know n, k or connectivity in the network, except in their own neighborhoods, and they do not maintain any routing tables. In the first algorithm, all the sensors have the knowledge of n and k. In the second algorithm, each sensor estimates these parameters through the random walk dissemination. We present analysis of the communication/transmission and encoding/decoding complexity of these two algorithms, and provide extensive simulation results as well

<summary>2009-06-03 14:32:37 - Dynamic Data Flow Analysis via Virtual Code Integration (aka The SpiderPig case)</summary>

- *Piotr Bania*

- `0906.0724v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0724v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.0724v1)

> Paper addresses the process of dynamic data flow analysis using virtual code integration (VCI), often refered to as dynamic binary rewriting. This article will try to demonstrate all of the techniques that were applied in the SpiderPig project. It will also discuss the main differences between the methods that were employed and those used in other available software, as well as introducing other related work. SpiderPig's approach was found to be very fast and was transparent enough for reliable and usable data flow analysis. It was created with the purpose of providing a tool which would aid vulnerability and security researchers with tracing and analyzing any necessary data and its further propagation through a program. At the current state it works on IA-32 platforms with Microsoft Windows systems and it supports FPU, SSE, MMX and all of the IA-32 general instructions. SpiderPig also demonstrates the usage of a virtual code integration (VCI) framework which allows for modifying the target application code at the instruction level. By this I mean that the VCI framework allows for custom code insertion, original code modification and full customization of the original application's code. Instructions can be swapped out, deleted or modified at a whim, without corrupting the surrounding code and side-effects of the modification are resolved.

- *Ram Kumar Singh, Prof. T. Ramajujam*

- `0906.5031v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5031v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.5031v1)

> The exponential growth of Internet traffic has made public servers increasingly vulnerable to unauthorized accesses and intrusions. In addition to maintaining low latency for the client, filtering unauthorized accesses has become one of the major concerns of a server maintainer. This implementation of an Intrusion Detection System distinguishes between the traffic coming from clients and the traffic originated from the attackers, in an attempt to simultaneously mitigate the problems of both latency and security. We then present the results of a series of stress and scalability tests, and suggest a number of potential uses for such a system. As computer attacks are becoming more and more difficult to identify the need for better and more efficient intrusion detection systems increases. The main problem with current intrusion detection systems is high rate of false alarms. Using honeypots provides effective solution to increase the security.

- *Abdelkader Lahmadi, Olivier Festor*

- `0907.3045v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3045v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.3045v1)

> SIP-based networks are becoming the de-facto standard for voice, video and instant messaging services. Being exposed to many threats while playing an major role in the operation of essential services, the need for dedicated security management approaches is rapidly increasing. In this paper we present an original security management approach based on a specific vulnerability aware SIP stateful firewall. Through known attack descriptions, we illustrate the power of the configuration language of the firewall which uses the capability to specify stateful objects that track data from multiple SIP elements within their lifetime. We demonstrate through measurements on a real implementation of the firewall its efficiency and performance.

- *Marc-André Laverdière, Serguei A. Mokhov, Djamel Benredjem*

- `0906.2512v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2512v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.2512v2)

> The functions standardized as part of ISO C 1999 and their addendums improved very little the security options from the previously available library. The largest flaw remained that no function asked for the buffer size of destination buffers for any function copying data into a user-supplied buffer. According to earlier research we performed, we know that error condition handling was the first solution to security vulnerabilities, followed by precondition validation. The standard C functions typically perform little precondition validation and error handling, allowing for a wide range of security issues to be introduced in their use. ISO/IEC TR 24731, titled as "TR 24731: Safer C library functions", defines 41 new library functions for memory copying, string handling (both for normal and wide character strings), time printing, sorting, searching etc. Another innovation it brings is a constraint handling architecture, forcing error handling when certain security-related preconditions are violated when the functions are called. It also specifies the null-termination of all strings manipulated through its function and introduces a new unsigned integer type that helps preventing integer overflows and underflows. It is currently implemented by Microsoft as part of their Visual Studio 2005 and above. We examine the architecture of our implementation of ISO/IEC TR 24731. We first introduce our architectural philosophy before informing the reader about the Siemens Four View Model, an architectural methodology for the conception of large-scale software systems. Afterwards, we examine each of the view, as architected for our library. Finally, we conclude with other software engineering matters that were of high importance in the development of our implementation.

<summary>2009-08-03 10:47:42 - Performance Evaluation of Mesh based Multicast Reactive Routing Protocol under Black Hole Attack</summary>

- *E. A. Mary Anita, V. Vasudevan*

- `0908.0222v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0222v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0222v1)

> A mobile ad-hoc network is an autonomous system of mobile nodes connected by wireless links in which nodes cooperate by forwarding packets for each other thereby enabling communication beyond direct wireless transmission range. The wireless and dynamic nature of ad-hoc networks makes them vulnerable to attacks especially in routing protocols. Providing security in mobile ad-hoc networks has been a major issue over the recent years. One of the prominent mesh base reactive multicast routing protocols used in ad-hoc networks is On Demand Multicast Routing protocol (ODMRP). The security of ODMRP is compromised by a primary routing attack called black hole attack. In this attack a malicious node advertises itself as having the shortest path to the node whose packets it wants to intercept. This paper discusses the impact of black hole attack on ODMRP under various scenarios. The performance is evaluated using metrics such as packet delivery ratio and end to end delay for various numbers of senders and receivers via simulation. Simulations are carried out using network simulator ns-2. The results enable us to propose solutions to counter the effect of black hole attack.

<summary>2009-08-07 14:02:40 - Vulnerability analysis of three remote voting methods</summary>

- *Chantal Enguehard, Rémi Lehn*

- `0908.1059v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1059v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1059v1)

> This article analyses three methods of remote voting in an uncontrolled environment: postal voting, internet voting and hybrid voting. It breaks down the voting process into different stages and compares their vulnerabilities considering criteria that must be respected in any democratic vote: confidentiality, anonymity, transparency, vote unicity and authenticity. Whether for safety or reliability, each vulnerability is quantified by three parameters: size, visibility and difficulty to achieve. The study concludes that the automatisation of treatments combined with the dematerialisation of the objects used during an election tends to substitute visible vulnerabilities of a lesser magnitude by invisible and widespread vulnerabilities.

> Inspired by our earlier work on Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) secrecy, we propose a simple, yet efficient, security overlay protocol to existing 802.11 networks. Our work targets networks secured by the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol because of its widespread use and vulnerability to a multitude of security threats. By exploiting the existing ARQ protocol in the 802.11 standard, our proposed opportunistic secrecy scheme is shown to defend against all known passive WEP attacks. Moreover, our implementation on the madwifi-ng driver is used to establish the achievability of a vanishing secrecy outage probability in several realistic scenarios.

> Web application (WA) expands its usages to provide more and more services and it has become one of the most essential communication channels between service providers and the users. To augment the users experience many web applications are using client side scripting languages such as JavaScript but this growing of JavaScript is increasing serious security vulnerabilities in web application too, such as cross site scripting (XSS). In this paper, I survey all the techniques those have been used to detect XSS and arrange a number of analyses to evaluate performances of those methodologies. This paper points major difficulties to detect XSS. I do not implement any solution of this vulnerability problem because my focus is for reviewing this issue. But, I believe that this assessment will be cooperative for further research on this concern as this treatise figure out everything on this transcendent security problem.

- `0909.0576v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0576v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.0576v1)

> Wireless Sensor networks (WSN) is an emerging technology and have great potential to be employed in critical situations like battlefields and commercial applications such as building, traffic surveillance, habitat monitoring and smart homes and many more scenarios. One of the major challenges wireless sensor networks face today is security. While the deployment of sensor nodes in an unattended environment makes the networks vulnerable to a variety of potential attacks, the inherent power and memory limitations of sensor nodes makes conventional security solutions unfeasible. The sensing technology combined with processing power and wireless communication makes it profitable for being exploited in great quantity in future. The wireless communication technology also acquires various types of security threats. This paper discusses a wide variety of attacks in WSN and their classification mechanisms and different securities available to handle them including the challenges faced.

> Secure access of communication networks has become an increasingly important area of consideration for the communication service providers of present day. Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) networks are proving to be an efficient and cost effective solution for the provisioning of high rate wireless traffic links in static and mobile domains. The secure access of these networks is necessary to ensure their superior operation and revenue efficacy. Although authentication process is a key to secure access in BWA networks, the breaches present in them limit the networks performance. In this paper, the vulnerabilities in the authentication frameworks of BWA networks have been unveiled. Moreover, this paper also describes the limitations of these protocols and of the solutions proposed to them due to the involved computational complexities and overheads. The possible attacks on privacy and performance of BWA networks have been discussed and explained in detail.

- `0909.1402v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1402v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.1402v1)

> A mobile ad hoc network (MANETs) is a self-organizing system of mobile nodes that communicate with each other via wireless links with no fixed infrastructure or centralized administration such as base station or access points. Nodes in a MANETs operate both as host as well as routers to forward packets for each other in a multihop fashion. For many applications in wireless networks, multicasting is an important and frequent communication service. By multicasting, since a single message can be delivered to multiple receivers simultaneously. It greatly reduces the transmission cost when sending the same packet to multiple recipients.   The security issue of MANETs in group communications is even more challenging because of involvement of multiple senders and multiple receivers. At that time of multicasting, mobile ad hoc network are unprotected by the attacks of malicious nodes because of vulnerabilities of routing protocols. Some of the attacks are Rushing attack, Blackhole attack, Sybil attack, Neighbor attack and Jellyfish attack.   This paper is based on Rushing attack. In Rushing attack, the attacker exploits the duplicate suppression mechanism by quickly forwarding route discovery packets in order to gain access to the forwarding group and this will affect the Average Attack Success Rate.   In this paper, the goal is to measure the impact of Rushing attack and their node positions which affect the performance metrics of Average Attack Success Rate with respect to three scenarios: near sender, near receiver and anywhere within the network. The performance of the Attack Success Rate with respect to above three scenarios is also compared.

- `0909.2371v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2371v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.2371v1)

> Security is an essential requirement in mobile ad hoc networks to provide protected communication between mobile nodes. Due to unique characteristics of MANETS, it creates a number of consequential challenges to its security design. To overcome the challenges, there is a need to build a multifence security solution that achieves both broad protection and desirable network performance. MANETs are vulnerable to various attacks, blackhole, is one of the possible attacks. Black hole is a type of routing attack where a malicious node advertise itself as having the shortest path to all nodes in the environment by sending fake route reply. By doing this, the malicious node can deprive the traffic from the source node. It can be used as a denial-of-service attack where it can drop the packets later. In this paper, we proposed a DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and Reactive AODV) to prevent security threats of blackhole by notifying other nodes in the network of the incident. The simulation results in ns2 (ver- 2.33) demonstrate that our protocol not only prevents blackhole attack but consequently improves the overall performance of (normal) AODV in presence of black hole attack.

> Vulnerability of dedicated hash functions to various attacks has made the task of designing hash function much more challenging. This provides us a strong motivation to design a new cryptographic hash function viz. HF-hash. This is a hash function, whose compression function is designed by using first 32 polynomials of HFE Challenge-1 with 64 variables by forcing remaining 16 variables as zero. HF-hash gives 256 bits message digest and is as efficient as SHA-256. It is secure against the differential attack proposed by Chabaud and Joux as well as by Wang et. al. applied to SHA-0 and SHA-1.

- `0910.2115v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2115v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.2115v1)

> In 2006, Peris-Lopez et al. [1, 2, 3] initiated the design of ultralightweight RFID protocols -with the UMAP family of protocols- involving only simple bitwise logical or arithmetic operations such as bitwise XOR, OR, AND, and addition. This combination of operations was revealed later to be insufficient for security. Then, Chien et al. proposed the SASI protocol [4] with the aim of offering better security, by adding the bitwise rotation to the set of supported operations. The SASI protocol represented a milestone in the design of ultralightweight protocols, although certain attacks have been published against this scheme [5, 6, 7]. In 2008, a new protocol, named Gossamer [8], was proposed that can be considered a further development of both the UMAP family and SASI. Although no attacks have been published against Gossamer, Lee et al. [9] have recently published an alternative scheme that is highly reminiscent of SASI. In this paper, we show that Lee et al.'s scheme fails short of many of its security objectives, being vulnerable to several important attacks like traceability, full disclosure, cloning and desynchronization.

> Algebraic and fast algebraic attacks are power tools to analyze stream ciphers. A class of symmetric Boolean functions with maximum algebraic immunity were found vulnerable to fast algebraic attacks at EUROCRYPT'06. Recently, the notion of AAR (algebraic attack resistant) functions was introduced as a unified measure of protection against both classical algebraic and fast algebraic attacks. In this correspondence, we first give a decomposition of symmetric Boolean functions, then we show that almost all symmetric Boolean functions, including these functions with good algebraic immunity, behave badly against fast algebraic attacks, and we also prove that no symmetric Boolean functions are AAR functions. Besides, we improve the relations between algebraic degree and algebraic immunity of symmetric Boolean functions.

Usually vulnerable systems need to be stop and put into wait state, hence to insure the data security and privacy while being recovered. This research ensures the availability of services and data to the end user by keeping the data security, privacy and integrity intact. To achieve the specified goals, the behavior of chameleons and concept of hibernation has been considered in combination. Hence the workflow systems become more robust using biologically inspired methods and remain available to the business consumers safely even in a vulnerable state.

> Software has become an integral part of everyday life. Everyday, millions of people perform transaction through internet, ATM, mobile phone, they send email and Egreetings, and use word processing and spreadsheet for various purpose. People use software bearing in mind that it is reliable and can be trust upon and the operation they perform is secured. Now, if these software have exploitable security hole then how can they be safe for use. Security brings value to software in terms of peoples trust. The value provided by secure software is of vital importance because many critical functions are entirely dependent on the software. That is why security is a serious topic which should be given proper attention during the entire SDLC, right from the beginning. For the proper implementation of security in the software, twenty one security rules are proposed in this paper along with validation results. It is found that by applying these rules as per given implementation mechanism, most of the vulnerabilities are eliminated in the software and a more secure software can be built.

> Over the recent years, IP and email spoofing gained much importance for security concerns due to the current changes in manipulating the system performance in different online environments. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used to secure these environments for sharing their data over network and host based IDS approaches. However, the rapid growth of intrusion events over Internet and local area network become responsible for the distribution of different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing systems. The current signature detection approach used by IDS, detects unclear actions based on analyzing and describing the action patterns such as time, text, password etc and has been faced difficulties in updating information, detect unknown novel attacks, maintenance of an IDS which is necessarily connected with analyzing and patching of security holes, and the lack of information on user privileges and attack signature structure. Thus, this paper proposes an EADS (Exception agent detection system) for securing the header information carried by IP over online environments. The study mainly concerns with the deployment of new technique for detecting and eliminating the unknown threats attacks during the data sharing over online environments.

Such approaches remain static and do take into account the population displacement in the estimation of the vulnerability. We propose a decision making tool based on a dynamic vulnerability map to evaluate the difficulty of evacuation in the different sectors of CODAH. We use a Geographic Information system (GIS) to visualize the map which evolves with the road traffic state through a detection of communities in large graphs algorithm.

> We have found a security risk in the Liu's cypher based on random signals and feedback, when it utilizes a large class of noises for communication in its most secure state, the steady state. For the vulnerability to exist, the noise must have a spectrum which can be transformed to white-like noise by linear filtering. For the cracking, we utilize the natural properties of power density spectra and autocorrelation functions. We introduce and demonstrate the method for Lorentzian spectra. Some of the implications of the results concern the transient operation during changing bits, where the modulation products of noise cannot be band-limited therefore the cypher is vulnerable. We propose the application of line filters to provide a proper spectral shape and to improve the security.

> Sensor networks are vulnerable to \emph{false data injection attack} and \emph{path-based DoS} (PDoS) attack. While conventional authentication schemes are insufficient for solving these security conflicts, an \emph{en-route filtering} scheme acts as a defense against these two attacks. To construct an efficient en-route filtering scheme, this paper first presents a Constrained Function based message Authentication (CFA) scheme, which can be thought of as a hash function directly supporting the en-route filtering functionality. Together with the \emph{redundancy property} of sensor networks, which means that an event can be simultaneously observed by multiple sensor nodes, the devised CFA scheme is used to construct a CFA-based en-route filtering (CFAEF) scheme. In contrast to most of the existing methods, which rely on complicated security associations among sensor nodes, our design, which directly exploits an en-route filtering hash function, appears to be novel. We examine the CFA and CFAEF schemes from both the theoretical and numerical aspects to demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness.

> Information and computer security is supported largely by passwords which are the principle part of the authentication process. The most common computer authentication method is to use alphanumerical username and password which has significant drawbacks. To overcome the vulnerabilities of traditional methods, visual or graphical password schemes have been developed as possible alternative solutions to text based scheme. A potential drawback of graphical password schemes is that they are more vulnerable to shoulder surfing than conventional alphanumeric text passwords. When users input their passwords in a public place, they may be at risk of attackers stealing their password. An attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the individuals authentication session. This is referred to as shouldersurfing and is a known risk, of special concern when authenticating in public places. In this paper we will present a survey on graphical password schemes from 2005 till 2009 which are proposed to be resistant against shoulder surfing attacks.

> Network penetration testing identifies the exploits and vulnerabilities those exist within computer network infrastructure and help to confirm the security measures. The objective of this paper is to explain methodology and methods behind penetration testing and illustrate remedies over it, which will provide substantial value for network security Penetration testing should model real world attacks as closely as possible. An authorized and scheduled penetration testing will probably detected by IDS (Intrusion Detection System). Network penetration testing is done by either or manual automated tools. Penetration test can gather evidence of vulnerability in the network. Successful testing provides indisputable evidence of the problem as well as starting point for prioritizing remediation. Penetration testing focuses on high severity vulnerabilities and there are no false positive.

> Google's Android is a comprehensive software framework for mobile communication devices (i.e., smartphones, PDAs). The Android framework includes an operating system, middleware and a set of key applications. The incorporation of integrated access services to the Internet on such mobile devices, however, increases their exposure to damages inflicted by various types of malware. This paper provides a comprehensive security assessment of the Android framework and the security mechanisms incorporated into it. A methodological qualitative risk analysis that we conducted identifies the high-risk threats to the framework and any potential danger to information or to the system resulting from vulnerabilities that have been uncovered and exploited. Our review of current academic and commercial solutions in the area of smartphone security yields a list of applied and recommended defense mechanisms for hardening mobile devices in general and the Android in particular. Lastly, we present five major (high-risk) threats to the Android framework and propose security solutions to mitigate them. We conclude by proposing a set of security mechanisms that should be explored and introduced into Android-powered devices.

<summary>2009-12-30 22:13:59 - GNSS-based positioning: Attacks and Countermeasures</summary>

> Increasing numbers of mobile computing devices, user-portable, or embedded in vehicles, cargo containers, or the physical space, need to be aware of their location in order to provide a wide range of commercial services. Most often, mobile devices obtain their own location with the help of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), integrating, for example, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. Nonetheless, an adversary can compromise location-aware applications by attacking the GNSS-based positioning: It can forge navigation messages and mislead the receiver into calculating a fake location. In this paper, we analyze this vulnerability and propose and evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures. First, we consider replay attacks, which can be effective even in the presence of future cryptographic GNSS protection mechanisms. Then, we propose and analyze methods that allow GNSS receivers to detect the reception of signals generated by an adversary, and then reject fake locations calculated because of the attack. We consider three diverse defense mechanisms, all based on knowledge, in particular, own location, time, and Doppler shift, receivers can obtain prior to the onset of an attack. We find that inertial mechanisms that estimate location can be defeated relatively easy. This is equally true for the mechanism that relies on clock readings from off-the-shelf devices; as a result, highly stable clocks could be needed. On the other hand, our Doppler Shift Test can be effective without any specialized hardware, and it can be applied to existing devices.
