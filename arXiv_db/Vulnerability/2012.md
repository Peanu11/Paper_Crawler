- `1201.0397v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0397v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.0397v1)

> This paper is a proof-of-concept demonstration for a specific digital signatures vulnerability that shows the ineffectiveness of the WYSIWYS (What You See Is What You Sign) concept. The algorithm is fairly simple: the attacker generates a polymorphic file that has two different types of content (text, as a PDF document for example, and image: TIFF - two of the most widely used file formats). When the victim signs the dual content file, he/ she only sees a PDF document and is unaware of the hidden content inside the file. After obtaining the legally signed document from the victim, the attacker simply has to change the extension to the other file format. This will not invalidate the digital signature, as no bits were altered. The destructive potential of the attack is considerable, as the Portable Document Format (PDF) is widely used in e-government and in e-business contexts.

> Recently, Li et al. proposed a dynamic identity based authentication protocol for multi-server architecture. They claimed their protocol is secure and can withstand various attacks. But we found some security loopholes in the protocol. Accordingly, the current paper demonstrates that Li et al.'s protocol is vulnerable to the replay attack, the password guessing attack and the masquerade attack.

> Modern technologies are becoming ever more integrated with each other. Mobile phones are becoming increasing intelligent, and handsets are growing ever more like computers in functionality. We are entering a new era - the age of smart houses, global advanced networks which encompass a wide range of devices, all of them exchanging data with each other. Such trends clearly open new horizons to malicious users, and the potential threats are self evident. In this paper, we study and discuss one of the most famous mobile operating systems 'Symbian'; its vulnerabilities and recommended protection technologies.

<summary>2012-01-17 18:33:44 - On the Security of Non-Linear HB (NLHB) Protocol Against Passive Attack</summary>

- *Mohammad Reza Sohizadeh Abyaneh*

- `1007.4414v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4414v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.4414v3)

> As a variant of the HB authentication protocol for RFID systems, which relies on the complexity of decoding linear codes against passive attacks, Madhavan et al. presented Non-Linear HB(NLHB) protocol. In contrast to HB, NLHB relies on the complexity of decoding a class of non-linear codes to render the passive attacks proposed against HB ineffective. In this paper, we show that passive attacks against HB protocol can still be applicable to NLHB and this protocol does not provide the desired security margin. In our attack, we first linearize the non-linear part of NLHB to obtain a HB equivalent for NLHB, and then exploit the passive attack techniques proposed for the HB to evaluate the security margin of NLHB. The results show that although NLHB's security margin is relatively higher than HB against similar passive attack techniques, it has been overestimated and, in contrary to what is claimed, NLHB is vulnerable to passive attacks against HB, especially when the noise vector in the protocol has a low weight.

<summary>2012-01-22 07:42:13 - A Multi-Path Certification Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks</summary>

- *Jaydip Sen*

- `1201.4536v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4536v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.4536v1)

> A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of autonomous nodes that communicate with each other by forming a multi-hop radio network and maintaining connections in a decentralized manner. Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Most of the routing protocols for MANETs are thus vulnerable to various types of attacks. For security, these protocols are highly dependent on cryptographic key exchange operations. This paper presents a multi-path certification protocol for efficient and reliable key exchange among the nodes in a MANET. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of the protocol.

<summary>2012-02-02 04:53:09 - Cryptographic Path Hardening: Hiding Vulnerabilities in Software through Cryptography</summary>

- *Vijay Ganesh, Michael Carbin, Martin Rinard*

- `1202.0359v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0359v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.0359v1)

> We propose a novel approach to improving software security called Cryptographic Path Hardening, which is aimed at hiding security vulnerabilities in software from attackers through the use of provably secure and obfuscated cryptographic devices to harden paths in programs.   By "harden" we mean that certain error-checking if-conditionals in a given program P are replaced by equivalent" we mean that adversaries cannot use semi-automatic program analysis techniques to reason about the hardened program paths and thus cannot discover as-yet-unknown errors along those paths, except perhaps through black-box dictionary attacks or random testing (which we can never prevent).   Other than these unpreventable attack methods, we can make program analysis aimed at error-finding "provably hard" for a resource-bounded attacker, in the same sense that cryptographic schemes are hard to break. Unlike security-through-obscurity, in Cryptographic Path Hardening we use provably-secure crypto devices to hide errors and our mathematical arguments of security are the same as the standard ones used in cryptography.   One application of Cryptographic Path Hardening is that software patches or filters often reveal enough information to an attacker that they can be used to construct error-revealing inputs to exploit an unpatched version of the program. By "hardening" the patch we make it difficult for the attacker to analyze the patched program to construct error-revealing inputs, and thus prevent him from potentially constructing exploits.

- *Hoda Jannati, Abolfazl Falahati*

- `1202.1971v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1971v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.1971v1)

> Widespread attention is recently paid upon RFID system structure considering its ease of deployment over an extensive range of applications. Due to its several advantages, many technical articles are published to improve its capabilities over specific system implementations. Recently, a lightweight anti-de-synchronization RFID authentication protocol and a lightweight binding proof protocol to guard patient safety are proposed. This contribution provides enough evidence to prove the first introduced protocol vulnerability to de-synchronization attack. It also provides the other protocol's suffering from de-synchronization attack as well as tracking the movements of the tags. This paper also addresses appropriate solutions to fix the security flaws concerning the two described protocols for secure RFID applications.

<summary>2012-02-23 10:04:40 - Mitigation of Random Query String DoS via Gossip</summary>

- *Stefano Ferretti, Vittorio Ghini*

- `1109.4404v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4404v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4404v2)

> This paper presents a mitigation scheme to cope with the random query string Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which is based on a vulnerability of current Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). The attack exploits the fact that edge servers composing a CDN, receiving an HTTP request for a resource with an appended random query string never saw before, ask the origin server for a (novel) copy of the resource. Such characteristics can be employed to take an attack against the origin server by exploiting edge servers. Our strategy adopts a simple gossip protocol executed by edge servers to detect the attack. Based on such a detection, countermeasures can be taken to protect the origin server and the CDN against the attack. We provide simulation results that show the viability of our approach.

<summary>2012-03-04 12:09:01 - Secure and Energy-Efficient Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks</summary>

- *Jaydip Sen*

- `1203.0732v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0732v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0732v1)

> Data aggregation in intermediate nodes (called aggregator nodes) is an effective approach for optimizing consumption of scarce resources like bandwidth and energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, in-network processing poses a problem for the privacy of the sensor data since individual data of sensor nodes need to be known to the aggregator node before the aggregation process can be carried out. In applications of WSNs, privacy-preserving data aggregation has become an important requirement due to sensitive nature of the sensor data. Researchers have proposed a number of protocols and schemes for this purpose. He et al. (INFOCOM 2007) have proposed a protocol - called CPDA - for carrying out additive data aggregation in a privacy-preserving manner for application in WSNs. The scheme has been quite popular and well-known. In spite of the popularity of this protocol, it has been found that the protocol is vulnerable to attack and it is also not energy-efficient. In this paper, we first present a brief state of the art survey on the current privacy-preserving data aggregation protocols for WSNS. Then we describe the CPDA protocol and identify its security vulnerability. Finally, we demonstrate how the protocol can be made secure and energy efficient.

> This chapter discusses the need of security and privacy protection mechanisms in aggregation protocols used in wireless sensor networks (WSN). It presents a comprehensive state of the art discussion on the various privacy protection mechanisms used in WSNs and particularly focuses on the CPDA protocols proposed by He et al. (INFOCOM 2007). It identifies a security vulnerability in the CPDA protocol and proposes a mechanism to plug that vulnerability. To demonstrate the need of security in aggregation process, the chapter further presents various threats in WSN aggregation mechanisms. A large number of existing protocols for secure aggregation in WSN are discussed briefly and a protocol is proposed for secure aggregation which can detect false data injected by malicious nodes in a WSN. The performance of the protocol is also presented. The chapter concludes while highlighting some future directions of research in secure data aggregation in WSNs.

<summary>2012-03-06 16:58:37 - Short expressions of permutations as products and cryptanalysis of the Algebraic Eraser</summary>

- *Arkadius Kalka, Mina Teicher, Boaz Tsaban*

- `0804.0629v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0629v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.0629v5)

> On March 2004, Anshel, Anshel, Goldfeld, and Lemieux introduced the \emph{Algebraic Eraser} scheme for key agreement over an insecure channel, using a novel hybrid of infinite and finite noncommutative groups. They also introduced the \emph{Colored Burau Key Agreement Protocol (CBKAP)}, a concrete realization of this scheme.   We present general, efficient heuristic algorithms, which extract the shared key out of the public information provided by CBKAP. These algorithms are, according to heuristic reasoning and according to massive experiments, successful for all sizes of the security parameters, assuming that the keys are chosen with standard distributions.   Our methods come from probabilistic group theory (permutation group actions and expander graphs). In particular, we provide a simple algorithm for finding short expressions of permutations in $S_n$, as products of given random permutations. Heuristically, our algorithm gives expressions of length $O(n^2\log n)$, in time and space $O(n^3)$. Moreover, this is provable from \emph{the Minimal Cycle Conjecture}, a simply stated hypothesis concerning the uniform distribution on $S_n$. Experiments show that the constants in these estimations are small. This is the first practical algorithm for this problem for $n\ge 256$.   Remark: \emph{Algebraic Eraser} is a trademark of SecureRF. The variant of CBKAP actually implemented by SecureRF uses proprietary distributions, and thus our results do not imply its vulnerability.

<summary>2012-03-12 22:50:58 - Octopus: A Secure and Anonymous DHT Lookup</summary>

- *Qiyan Wang, Nikita Borisov*

- `1203.2668v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2668v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.2668v1)

> Distributed Hash Table (DHT) lookup is a core technique in structured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Its decentralized nature introduces security and privacy vulnerabilities for applications built on top of them; we thus set out to design a lookup mechanism achieving both security and anonymity, heretofore an open problem. We present Octopus, a novel DHT lookup which provides strong guarantees for both security and anonymity. Octopus uses attacker identification mechanisms to discover and remove malicious nodes, severely limiting an adversary's ability to carry out active attacks, and splits lookup queries over separate anonymous paths and introduces dummy queries to achieve high levels of anonymity. We analyze the security of Octopus by developing an event-based simulator to show that the attacker discovery mechanisms can rapidly identify malicious nodes with low error rate. We calculate the anonymity of Octopus using probabilistic modeling and show that Octopus can achieve near-optimal anonymity. We evaluate Octopus's efficiency on Planetlab with 207 nodes and show that Octopus has reasonable lookup latency and manageable communication overhead.

<summary>2012-03-15 11:17:56 - Hybrid Generative/Discriminative Learning for Automatic Image Annotation</summary>

- *Shuang Hong Yang, Jiang Bian, Hongyuan Zha*

- `1203.3530v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3530v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.3530v1)

> Automatic image annotation (AIA) raises tremendous challenges to machine learning as it requires modeling of data that are both ambiguous in input and output, e.g., images containing multiple objects and labeled with multiple semantic tags. Even more challenging is that the number of candidate tags is usually huge (as large as the vocabulary size) yet each image is only related to a few of them. This paper presents a hybrid generative-discriminative classifier to simultaneously address the extreme data-ambiguity and overfitting-vulnerability issues in tasks such as AIA. Particularly: (1) an Exponential-Multinomial Mixture (EMM) model is established to capture both the input and output ambiguity and in the meanwhile to encourage prediction sparsity; and (2) the prediction ability of the EMM model is explicitly maximized through discriminative learning that integrates variational inference of graphical models and the pairwise formulation of ordinal regression. Experiments show that our approach achieves both superior annotation performance and better tag scalability.

- `1203.6036v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6036v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.6036v1)

> This paper proposes a new block cipher termed as "Modular Arithmetic based Block Cipher with Varying Key-Spaces (MABCVK)" that uses private key-spaces of varying lengths to encrypt data files. There is a simple but intelligent use of theory of modular arithmetic in the scheme of the cipher. Based on observed implementation of the proposed cipher on a set of real data files of several types, all results are tabulated and analyzed.The schematic strength of the cipher and the freedom of using a long key-space expectedly can make it reasonably nonvulnerable against possible cryptanalytic attacks. As a part of the future scope of the work, it is also intended to formulate and implement an enhanced scheme that will use a carrier image to have a secure transmission of the private key.

> Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETS) are transient networks of mobile nodes, connected through wireless links, without any fixed infrastructure or central management. Due to the self-configuring nature of these networks, the topology is highly dynamic. This makes the Ad Hoc Routing Protocols in MANETS highly vulnerable to serious security issues. In this paper, we survey the common security threats and attacks and summarize the solutions suggested in the survey to mitigate these security vulnerabilities.

> Recently, the mobile industry has experienced an extreme increment in number of its users. The GSM network with the greatest worldwide number of users succumbs to several security vulnerabilities. Although some of its security problems are addressed in its upper generations, there are still many operators using 2G systems. This paper briefly presents the most important security flaws of the GSM network and its transport channels. It also provides some practical solutions to improve the security of currently available 2G systems.

> The GSM network with the greatest worldwide number of users, succumbs to several security vulnerabilities. The short message service (SMS) is one of its superior and well-tried services with a global availability in the GSM networks. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new secure application layer protocol, called SSMS, to efficiently embed the desired security attributes in the SMS messages to be used as a secure bearer in the m-payment systems. SSMS efficiently embeds the confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in the SMS messages. It provides an elliptic curve-based public key solution that uses public keys for the secret key establishment of a symmetric encryption. It also provides the attributes of public verification and forward secrecy. It efficiently makes the SMS messaging suitable for the m-payment applications where the security is the great concern.

> The Hill cipher is a classical symmetric encryption algorithm that succumbs to the know-plaintext attack. Although its vulnerability to cryptanalysis has rendered it unusable in practice, it still serves an important pedagogical role in cryptology and linear algebra. In this paper, a variant of the Hill cipher is introduced that makes the Hill cipher secure while it retains the efficiency. The proposed scheme includes a ciphering core for which a cryptographic protocol is introduced.

> The electronic mail plays an unavoidable role in the humankind communications. With the great interest for the connection via mobile platforms, and the growing number of vulnerabilities and attacks, it is essential to provide suitable security solutions regarding the limitations of resource restricted platforms. Although some solutions such as PGP and S/MIME are currently available for the secure e-mail over the Internet, they are based on traditional public key cryptography that involves huge computational costs. In this paper, a new secure application-layer protocol, called SMEmail, is introduced that provides several security attributes such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and forward secrecy of message confidentiality for the electronic mails. SMEmail offers an elliptic curve-based public key solution that uses public keys for the secure key establishment of a symmetric encryption, and is so suitable for the resource restricted platforms such as mobile phones.

<summary>2012-03-26 22:14:15 - An Independent Validation of Vulnerability Discovery Models</summary>

- `1203.5830v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5830v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5830v1)

> Having a precise vulnerability discovery model (VDM) would provide a useful quantitative insight to assess software security. Thus far, several models have been proposed with some evidence supporting their goodness-of-fit.   In this work we describe an independent validation of the applicability of six existing VDMs in seventeen releases of the three popular browsers Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. We have collected five different kinds of data sets based on different definitions of a vulnerability. We introduce two quantitative metrics, goodness-of-fit entropy and goodness-of-fit quality, to analyze the impact of vulnerability data sets to the stability as well as quality of VDMs in the software life cycles.   The experiment result shows that the "confirmed-by-vendors' advisories" data sets apparently yields more stable and better results for VDMs. And the performance of the s-shape logistic model (AML) seems to be superior performance in overall. Meanwhile, Anderson thermodynamic model (AT) is indeed not suitable for modeling the vulnerability discovery process. This means that the discovery process of vulnerabilities and normal bugs are different because the interests of people in finding security vulnerabilities are more than finding normal programming bugs.

> In this paper, we propose new sequential methods for detecting port-scan attackers which routinely perform random "portscans" of IP addresses to find vulnerable servers to compromise. In addition to rigorously control the probability of falsely implicating benign remote hosts as malicious, our method performs significantly faster than other current solutions. Moreover, our method guarantees that the maximum amount of observational time is bounded. In contrast to the previous most effective method, Threshold Random Walk Algorithm, which is explicit and analytical in nature, our proposed algorithm involve parameters to be determined by numerical methods. We have developed computational techniques such as iterative minimax optimization for quick determination of the parameters of the new detection algorithm. A framework of multi-valued decision for testing portscanners is also proposed.

> We show how an off-path (spoofing-only) attacker can perform cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and site spoofing/defacement attacks, without requiring vulnerabilities in either web-browser or server and circumventing known defenses. Attacker can also launch devastating denial of service (DoS) attacks, even when the connection between the client and the server is secured with SSL/TLS. The attacks are practical and require a puppet (malicious script in browser sandbox) running on a the victim client machine, and attacker capable of IP-spoofing on the Internet. Our attacks use a technique allowing an off-path attacker to learn the sequence numbers of both client and server in a TCP connection. The technique exploits the fact that many computers, in particular those running Windows, use a global IP-ID counter, which provides a side channel allowing efficient exposure of the connection sequence numbers. We present results of experiments evaluating the learning technique and the attacks that exploit it. Finally, we present practical defenses that can be deployed at the firewall level; no changes to existing TCP/IP stacks are required.

> In-network data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) provides efficient bandwidth utilization and energy-efficient computing.Supporting efficient in-network data aggregation while preserving the privacy of the data of individual sensor nodes has emerged as an important requirement in numerous WSN applications. For privacy-preserving data aggregation in WSNs, He et al. (INFOCOM 2007) have proposed a Cluster-based Private Data Aggregation (CPDA) that uses a clustering protocol and a well-known key distribution scheme for computing an additive aggregation function in a privacy-preserving manner. In spite of the wide popularity of CPDA, it has been observed that the protocol is not secure and it is also possible to enhance its efficiency. In this paper, we first identify a security vulnerability in the existing CPDA scheme, wherein we show how a malicious participant node can launch an attack on the privacy protocol so as to get access to the private data of its neighboring sensor nodes. Next it is shown how the existing CPDA scheme can be made more efficient by suitable modification of the protocol. Further, suitable modifications in the existing protocol have been proposed so as to plug the vulnerability of the protocol.

<summary>2012-05-09 18:45:08 - A Bayesian Framework for Community Detection Integrating Content and Link</summary>

- *Tianbao Yang, Rong Jin, Yun Chi, Shenghuo Zhu*

- `1205.2603v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2603v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2603v1)

> This paper addresses the problem of community detection in networked data that combines link and content analysis. Most existing work combines link and content information by a generative model. There are two major shortcomings with the existing approaches. First, they assume that the probability of creating a link between two nodes is determined only by the community memberships of the nodes; however other factors (e.g. popularity) could also affect the link pattern. Second, they use generative models to model the content of individual nodes, whereas these generative models are vulnerable to the content attributes that are irrelevant to communities. We propose a Bayesian framework for combining link and content information for community detection that explicitly addresses these shortcomings. A new link model is presented that introduces a random variable to capture the node popularity when deciding the link between two nodes; a discriminative model is used to determine the community membership of a node by its content. An approximate inference algorithm is presented for efficient Bayesian inference. Our empirical study shows that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-theart approaches in combining link and content information for community detection.

> Cloud computing is appealing from management and efficiency perspectives, but brings risks both known and unknown. Well-known and hotly-debated information security risks, due to software vulnerabilities, insider attacks, and side-channels for example, may be only the "tip of the iceberg." As diverse, independently developed cloud services share ever more fluidly and aggressively multiplexed hardware resource pools, unpredictable interactions between load-balancing and other reactive mechanisms could lead to dynamic instabilities or "meltdowns." Non-transparent layering structures, where alternative cloud services may appear independent but share deep, hidden resource dependencies, may create unexpected and potentially catastrophic failure correlations, reminiscent of financial industry crashes. Finally, cloud computing exacerbates already-difficult digital preservation challenges, because only the provider of a cloud-based application or service can archive a "live," functional copy of a cloud artifact and its data for long-term cultural preservation. This paper explores these largely unrecognized risks, making the case that we should study them before our socioeconomic fabric becomes inextricably dependent on a convenient but potentially unstable computing model.

> The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. In the first part we look at the estimation problem where we characterize the resilience of a system to attacks and study the possibility of increasing its resilience by a change of parameters. We then propose an efficient algorithm to estimate the state despite the attacks and we characterize its performance. Our approach is inspired from the areas of error-correction over the reals and compressed sensing. In the second part we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.

> Verified boot is an interesting feature of Chromium OS that supposedly can detect any modification in the root file system (rootfs) by a dedicated adversary. However, by exploiting a design flaw in verified boot, we show that an adversary can replace the original rootfs by a malicious rootfs containing exploits such as a spyware or keylogger and still pass the verified boot process. The exploit is based on the fact that a dedicated adversary can replace the rootfs and the corresponding verification information in the bootloader. We experimentally demonstrate an attack using both the base and developer version of Chromium OS in which the adversary installs a spyware in the target system to send cached user data to the attacker machine in plain text which are otherwise encrypted, and thus inaccessible. We also demonstrate techniques to mitigate this vulnerability.

> Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently attracted a lot of interest in the research community due their wide range of applications. Unfortunately, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their proper functioning. This problem is more critical if the network is deployed for some mission-critical applications such as in a tactical battlefield. Random failure of nodes and intentional compromise of nodes by an insider attack in a WSN pose particularly difficult challenges to security engineers as these attacks cannot be defended by traditional cryptography-based mechanisms. In this paper, a security solution is proposed for detecting compromised and faulty nodes in a WSN. The mechanism also isolates a compromised node from the network so that it cannot participate in any network activity. The proposed mechanism is based on misbehavior classification, behaviour monitoring and trust management. It involves minimum computation and communication overhead and is ideally suited for a resource-constrained, high-integrity WSN.

> Port knocking is a technique by which only a single packet or special sequence will permit the firewall to open a port on a machine where all ports are blocked by default. It is a passive authorization technique which offers firewall-level authentication to ensure authorized access to potentially vulnerable network services. In this paper, we present performance evaluation and analytical comparison of three widely used port knocking (PK) algorithms, Aldaba, FWKNOP and SIG-2. Comparative analysis is based upon ten selected parameters; Platforms (Supported OS), Implementation (PK, SPA or both), Protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP), Out of Order packet delivery, NAT (Network Address Translation), Encryption Algorithms, Root privileges (For installation and operation), Weak Passwords, Replay Attacks and IPv6 compatibility. Based upon these parameters, relative performance score has been given to each algorithm. Finally, we deduce that FWKNOP due to compatibility with windows client is the most efficient among chosen PK implementations.

> Any decentralised distributed network is particularly vulnerable to the Sybil attack wherein a malicious node masquerades as several different nodes, called Sybil nodes, simultaneously in an attempt to disrupt the proper functioning of the network. Such attacks may cause damage on a fairly large scale especially since they are difficult to detect and there has been no universally accepted scheme to counter them as yet. In this paper, we discuss the different kinds of Sybil attacks including those occurring in peer-to-peer reputation systems, self-organising networks and even social network systems. In addition, various methods that have been suggested over time to decrease or eliminate their risk completely are also analysed along with their modus operandi.

> Many tools and libraries are readily available to build and operate distributed Web applications. While the setup of operational environments is comparatively easy, practice shows that their continuous secure operation is more difficult to achieve, many times resulting in vulnerable systems exposed to the Internet. Authenticated vulnerability scanners and validation tools represent a means to detect security vulnerabilities caused by missing patches or misconfiguration, but current approaches center much around the concepts of hosts and operating systems. This paper presents a language and an approach for the declarative specification and execution of machine-readable security checks for sets of more fine-granular system components depending on each other in a distributed environment. Such a language, building on existing standards, fosters the creation and sharing of security content among security stakeholders. Our approach is exemplified by vulnerabilities of and corresponding checks for Open Source Software commonly used in today's Internet applications.

> Today, Internet offers many critical applications. So, it becomes very crucial for Internet service providers to ensure traceability of operations and to secure data exchange. Since all these communications are based on the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, it becomes necessary to think to enhance and secure it by proposing a secure version of this protocol that can correct the whole or a part of the DNS protocol weaknesses and vulnerabilities. In this context, DNSsec was created by the IETF to ensure the integrity of DNS data and authentication of the source of such data. DNSsec is based on the key cryptography public to provide different security services. In the present paper, we will present first the DNS protocol and its weaknesses. After that, we will be interested in studying the DNSsec implementation and data exchange, and then give a deep analysis of its weaknesses.

We further identify several applications in software engineering, and propose different network-based quality indicators that address software design, efficiency, reusability, vulnerability, controllability and other. We also highlight various interesting findings, e.g., software systems are highly vulnerable to processes like bug propagation, however, they are not easily controllable.

> The main stretch in the paper is buffer overflow anomaly occurring in major source codes, designed in various programming language. It describes the various as to how to improve your code and increase its strength to withstand security theft occurring at vulnerable areas in the code. The main language used is JAVA, regarded as one of the most object oriented language still create lot of error like stack overflow, illegal/inappropriate method overriding. I used tools confined to JAVA to test as how weak points in the code can be rectified before compiled. The byte code theft is difficult to be conquered, so it's a better to get rid of it in the plain java code itself. The tools used in the research are PMD(Programming mistake detector), it helps to detect line of code that make pop out error in near future like defect in hashcode(memory maps) overriding due to which the java code will not function correctly. Another tool is FindBUGS which provide the tester of the code to analyze the weak points in the code like infinite loop, unsynchronized wait, deadlock situation, null referring and dereferencing. Another tool which provides the base to above tools is JaCoCo code coverage analysis used to detect unreachable part and unused conditions of the code which improves the space complexity and helps in easy clarification of errors.   Through this paper, we design an algorithm to prevent the loss of data. The main audience is the white box tester who might leave out essential line of code like, index variables, infinite loop, and inappropriate hashcode in the major source program. This algorithm serves to reduce the damage in case of buffer overflow

> The use of anonymity-based infrastructures and anonymisers is a plausible solution to mitigate privacy problems on the Internet. Tor (short for The onion router) is a popular low-latency anonymity system that can be installed as an end-user application on a wide range of operating systems to redirect the traffic through a series of anonymising proxy circuits. The construction of these circuits determines both the latency and the anonymity degree of the Tor anonymity system. While some circuit construction strategies lead to delays which are tolerated for activities like Web browsing, they can make the system vulnerable to linking attacks. We evaluate in this paper three classical strategies for the construction of Tor circuits, with respect to their de-anonymisation risk and latency performance. We then develop a new circuit selection algorithm that considerably reduces the success probability of linking attacks while keeping a good degree of performance. We finally conduct experiments on a real-world Tor deployment over PlanetLab. Our experimental results confirm the validity of our strategy and its performance increase for Web browsing.

> The paper presents the implementation of a quantum cryptography protocol for secure communication between servers in the cloud. As computing power increases, classical cryptography and key management schemes based on computational complexity become increasingly susceptible to brute force and cryptanalytic attacks. Current implementations of quantum cryptography are based on the BB84 protocol, which is susceptible to siphoning attacks on the multiple photons emitted by practical laser sources. The three-stage protocol, whose implementation is described in this paper, is a departure from conventional practice and it obviates some of the known vulnerabilities of the current implementations of quantum cryptography. This paper presents an implementation of the three-stage quantum communication protocol in free-space. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first implementation of a quantum protocol where multiple photons can be used for secure communication.

> The security of Android has been recently challenged by the discovery of a number of vulnerabilities involving different layers of the Android stack. We argue that such vulnerabilities are largely related to the interplay among layers composing the Android stack. Thus, we also argue that such interplay has been underestimated from a security point-of-view and a systematic analysis of the Android interplay has not been carried out yet. To this aim, in this paper we provide a simple model of the Android cross-layer interactions based on the concept of flow, as a basis for analyzing the Android interplay. In particular, our model allows us to reason about the security implications associated with the cross-layer interactions in Android, including a recently discovered vulnerability that allows a malicious application to make Android devices totally unresponsive. We used the proposed model to carry out an empirical assessment of some flows within the Android cross-layered architecture. Our experiments indicate that little control is exercised by the Android Security Framework (ASF) over cross-layer interactions in Android. In particular, we observed that the ASF lacks in discriminating the originator of a flow and sensitive security issues arise between the Android stack and the Linux kernel, thereby indicating that the attack surface of the Android platform is wider than expected.

> Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising concept to meet the challenges in next-generation wireless networks such as providing flexible, adaptive, and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective solutions to service providers. As WMNs become an increasingly popular replacement technology for last-mile connectivity to the home networking, community and neighborhood networking, it is imperative to design efficient and secure communication protocols for these networks. However, several vulnerabilities exist in currently existing protocols for WMNs. These security loopholes can be exploited by potential attackers to launch attack on WMNs. The absence of a central point of administration makes securing WMNs even more challenging. The broadcast nature of transmission and the dependency on the intermediate nodes for multi-hop communications lead to several security vulnerabilities in WMNs. The attacks can be external as well as internal in nature. External attacks are launched by intruders who are not authorized users of the network. For example, an intruding node may eavesdrop on the packets and replay those packets at a later point of time to gain access to the network resources. On the other hand, the internal attacks are launched by the nodes that are part of the WMN. On example of such attack is an intermediate node dropping packets which it was supposed to forward. This chapter presents a comprehensive discussion on the current authentication and privacy protection schemes for WMN. In addition, it proposes a novel security protocol for node authentication and message confidentiality and an anonymization scheme for privacy protection of users in WMNs.

- `1209.2531v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2531v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.2531v1)

> EMV, also known as "Chip and PIN", is the leading system for card payments worldwide. It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be introduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can execute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires point-of-sale (POS) terminals or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for each transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered that some EMV implementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to supply this number. This exposes them to a "pre-play" attack which is indistinguishable from card cloning from the standpoint of the logs available to the card-issuing bank, and can be carried out even if it is impossible to clone a card physically (in the sense of extracting the key material and loading it into another card). Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV was supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a survey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence from ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of proof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest manufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of frauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards cannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be mistaken or complicit. Pre-play attacks may also be carried out by malware in an ATM or POS terminal, or by a man-in-the-middle between the terminal and the acquirer. We explore the design and implementation mistakes that enabled the flaw to evade detection until now: shortcomings of the EMV specification, of the EMV kernel certification process, of implementation testing, formal analysis, or monitoring customer complaints. Finally we discuss countermeasures.

> Shannon sought security against the attacker with unlimited computational powers: *if an information source conveys some information, then Shannon's attacker will surely extract that information*. Diffie and Hellman refined Shannon's attacker model by taking into account the fact that the real attackers are computationally limited. This idea became one of the greatest new paradigms in computer science, and led to modern cryptography.   Shannon also sought security against the attacker with unlimited logical and observational powers, expressed through the maxim that "the enemy knows the system". This view is still endorsed in cryptography. The popular formulation, going back to Kerckhoffs, is that "there is no security by obscurity", meaning that the algorithms cannot be kept obscured from the attacker, and that security should only rely upon the secret keys. In fact, modern cryptography goes even further than Shannon or Kerckhoffs in tacitly assuming that *if there is an algorithm that can break the system, then the attacker will surely find that algorithm*. The attacker is not viewed as an omnipotent computer any more, but he is still construed as an omnipotent programmer.   So the Diffie-Hellman step from unlimited to limited computational powers has not been extended into a step from unlimited to limited logical or programming powers. Is the assumption that all feasible algorithms will eventually be discovered and implemented really different from the assumption that everything that is computable will eventually be computed? The present paper explores some ways to refine the current models of the attacker, and of the defender, by taking into account their limited logical and programming powers. If the adaptive attacker actively queries the system to seek out its vulnerabilities, can the system gain some security by actively learning attacker's methods, and adapting to them?

> Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) such as Chord and Kademlia offer an efficient solution for locating resources in peer-to-peer networks. Unfortunately, malicious nodes along a lookup path can easily subvert such queries. Several systems, including Halo (based on Chord) and Kad (based on Kademlia), mitigate such attacks by using a combination of redundancy and diversity in the paths taken by redundant lookup queries. Much greater assurance can be provided, however. We describe Reputation for Directory Services (ReDS), a framework for enhancing lookups in redundant DHTs by tracking how well other nodes service lookup requests. We describe how the ReDS technique can be applied to virtually any redundant DHT including Halo and Kad. We also study the collaborative identification and removal of bad lookup paths in a way that does not rely on the sharing of reputation scores --- we show that such sharing is vulnerable to attacks that make it unsuitable for most applications of ReDS. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that ReDS improves lookup success rates for Halo and Kad by 80% or more over a wide range of conditions, even against strategic attackers attempting to game their reputation scores and in the presence of node churn.

> RFID tags are heavily constrained in computational and storage capabilities, and raise numerous privacy concerns in everyday life due to their vulnerability to different attacks. Both forward security and backward security are required to maintain the privacy of a tag i.e., exposure of a tag's secret key should not reveal the past or future secret keys of the tag. We envisage the need for a formal model for backward security for RFID protocol designs in shared key settings, since the RFID tags are too resource-constrained to support public key settings. However, there has not been much research on backward security for shared key environment since Serge Vaudenay in his Asiacrypt 2007 paper showed that perfect backward security is impossible to achieve without public key settings. We propose a Key-Insulated Mutual Authentication Protocol for shared key environment, KIMAP, which minimizes the damage caused by secret key exposure using insulated keys. Even if a tag's secret key is exposed during an authentication session, forward security and `restricted' backward security of the tag are preserved under our assumptions. The notion of `restricted' backward security is that the adversary misses the protocol transcripts which are needed to update the compromised secret key. Although our definition does not capture perfect backward security, it is still suitable for effective implementation as the tags are highly mobile in practice. We also provide a formal security model of KIMAP. Our scheme is more efficient than previous proposals from the viewpoint of computational requirements.

> Collective intelligence, which aggregates the shared information from large crowds, is often negatively impacted by unreliable information sources with the low quality data. This becomes a barrier to the effective use of collective intelligence in a variety of applications. In order to address this issue, we propose a probabilistic model to jointly assess the reliability of sources and find the true data. We observe that different sources are often not independent of each other. Instead, sources are prone to be mutually influenced, which makes them dependent when sharing information with each other. High dependency between sources makes collective intelligence vulnerable to the overuse of redundant (and possibly incorrect) information from the dependent sources. Thus, we reveal the latent group structure among dependent sources, and aggregate the information at the group level rather than from individual sources directly. This can prevent the collective intelligence from being inappropriately dominated by dependent sources. We will also explicitly reveal the reliability of groups, and minimize the negative impacts of unreliable groups. Experimental results on real-world data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to existing algorithms.

> Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology that employs basic identifier of an object embedded in a chip, transmitted via radio wave, for identification. An RFID Card responds to query or interrogation irrespective of "Who" holds the Card; like a key to a door. Since an attacker can possess the card, access to such object can therefore be easily compromised. This security breach is classified as an unauthorized use of Card, and it forms the bedrock for RFID Card compromise especially in access control. As an on-card authentication mechanism, this research proposed a concept termed Bio-Thentic Card, which can be adopted to prevent this single point of failure of RFID Card. The Bio-Thentic Card was fabricated, tested and assessed in line with the known threats, and attacks; and it was observed to proffer substantive solution to unauthorized use of RFID Card vulnerability

> With the proliferation of wireless networks, mobile devices and medical devices are increasingly being equipped with wireless interfaces, such as Bluetooth and WiFi to allow easy access to and control of the medical devices. Unfortunately, the very presence and usage of such interfaces also expose the medical devices to novel attacks from malicious parties. The emerging threat from malicious mobile devices is significant and severe, since attackers can steal confidential data from a patient's medical device. Also, attackers can compromise the medical device and either feed doctors bad data from it or issue potentially fatal commands to the device, which may even result in the death of the patient. As the mobile devices are often at close proximity to the patient (either in the hospital or home settings), attacks from such devices are hard to prevent. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of this new threat from mobile devices on medical devices and healthcare infrastructure. We also perform a thorough security analysis of a major hospital and uncover potential vulnerabilities. Finally, we propose a set of potential solutions and defenses against such attacks.

> Applications of cyber technologies improve the quality of monitoring and decision making in smart grid. These cyber technologies are vulnerable to malicious attacks, and compromising them can have serious technical and economical problems. This paper specifies the effect of compromising each measurement on the price of electricity, so that the attacker is able to change the prices in the desired direction (increasing or decreasing). Attacking and defending all measurements are impossible for the attacker and defender, respectively. This situation is modeled as a zero sum game between the attacker and defender. The game defines the proportion of times that the attacker and defender like to attack and defend different measurements, respectively. From the simulation results based on the PJM 5 Bus test system, we can show the effectiveness and properties of the studied game.

> Smartphone technology is more and more becoming the predominant communication tool for people across the world. People use their smartphones to keep their contact data, to browse the internet, to exchange messages, to keep notes, carry their personal files and documents, etc. Users while browsing are also capable of shopping online, thus provoking a need to type their credit card numbers and security codes. As the smartphones are becoming widespread so do the security threats and vulnerabilities facing this technology. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS). Major limitations of smartphone technology are its processing power and its scarce energy source since smartphones rely on battery usage. Since smartphones are devices which change their network location as the user moves between different places, intrusion detection systems for smartphone technology are most often classified as IDSs designed for mobile ad-hoc networks. The aim of this research is to give a brief overview of IDS technology, give an overview of major machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms used in IDS technologies, give an overview of security models of iOS and Android and propose a new host-based IDS model for smartphones and create proof-of-concept application for Android platform for the newly proposed model. Keywords: IDS, SVM, Android, iOS;

<summary>2012-12-12 18:10:53 - A Text Steganography Method Using Pangram and Image Mediums</summary>

> Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one apart from the sender and the receiver would realize that a secret communicating is taking place. Unlike cryptography which only scrambles secret data keeping them overt, steganography covers secret data into medium files such as image files and transmits them in total secrecy avoiding drawing eavesdroppers suspicions. However, considering that the public channel is monitored by eavesdroppers, it is vulnerable to stego-attacks which refer to randomly trying to break the medium file and recover the secret data out of it. That is often true because steganalysts assume that the secret data are encoded into a single medium file and not into multiple ones that complement each other. This paper proposes a text steganography method for hiding secret textual data using two mediums; a Pangram sentence containing all the characters of the alphabet, and an uncompressed image file. The algorithm tries to search for every character of the secret message into the Pangram text. The search starts from a random index called seed and ends up on the index of the first occurrence of the character being searched for. As a result, two indexes are obtained, the seed and the offset indexes. Together they are embedded into the three LSBs of the color channels of the image medium. Ultimately, both mediums mainly the Pangram and the image are sent to the receiver. The advantage of the proposed method is that it makes the covert data hard to be recovered by unauthorized parties as it uses two mediums, instead of one, to deliver the secret data. Experiments conducted, illustrated an example that explained how to encode and decode a secret text message using the Pangram and the image mediums.

> Local Area Networks(LAN) at present become an important instrument for organizing of process and information communication in an organization. They provides important purposes such as association of large amount of data, hardware and software resources and expanding of optimum communications. Becase these network do work with valuable information, the problem of security providing is an important issue in organization. So, the stablishment of an information security management system(ISMS) in organization is significant. In this paper, we introduce ISMS and its implementation in LAN scop. The assets of LAN and threats and vulnerabilities of these assets are identified, the risks are evaluated and techniques to reduce them and at result security establishment of the network is expressed.
