> How to apply automated verification technology such as model checking and static program analysis to millions of lines of embedded C/C++ code? How to package this technology in a way that it can be used by software developers and engineers, who might have no background in formal verification? And how to convince business managers to actually pay for such a software? This work addresses a number of those questions. Based on our own experience on developing and distributing the Goanna source code analyzer for detecting software bugs and security vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, we explain the underlying technology of model checking, static analysis and SMT solving, steps involved in creating industrial-proof tools.

<summary>2013-01-04 23:54:49 - Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attacks</summary>

- *James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke*

- `1301.0849v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.0849v1)

> Regular expressions are a concise yet expressive language for expressing patterns. For instance, in networked software, they are used for input validation and intrusion detection. Yet some widely deployed regular expression matchers based on backtracking are themselves vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, since their runtime can be exponential for certain input strings. This paper presents a static analysis for detecting such vulnerable regular expressions. The running time of the analysis compares favourably with tools based on fuzzing, that is, randomly generating inputs and measuring how long matching them takes. Unlike fuzzers, the analysis pinpoints the source of the vulnerability and generates possible malicious inputs for programmers to use in security testing. Moreover, the analysis has a firm theoretical foundation in abstract machines. Testing the analysis on two large repositories of regular expressions shows that the analysis is able to find significant numbers of vulnerable regular expressions in a matter of seconds.

<summary>2013-01-08 11:25:49 - Computational Security Analysis of the UMTS and LTE Authentication and Key Agreement Protocols</summary>

- *Joe-Kai Tsay, Stig MjÃ¸lsnes*

- `1203.3866v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3866v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.3866v2)

> We present a computational security analysis of the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocols for both Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This work constitutes the first security analysis of LTE AKA to date and the first computationally sound analysis of UMTS AKA. Our work is the first formal analysis to consider messages that are sent in the core network, where we take into account details of the carrying protocol (i.e., MAP or Diameter) and of the mechanism for secure transport (i.e., MAPsec/TCAPsec or IPsec ESP). Moreover, we report on a deficiency in the protocol specifications of UMTS AKA and LTE AKA and the specifications of the core network security (called network domain security), which may enable efficient attacks. The vulnerability allows an inside attacker not only to impersonate an honest protocol participant during a run of the protocol but also to subsequently use wireless services on his behalf. UMTS AKA run over MAP with MAPsec seems vulnerable in the most straight-forward application of the attack. On the other hand, our analysis shows that UMTS and LTE AKA over Diameter/IPsec and UMTS AKA over MAP/TCAPsec (with sufficiently long session identifiers) computationally satisfy intended authentication properties as well as some key secrecy properties, assuming that the used primitives meet standard cryptographic assumptions.

- `1301.1912v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1912v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.1912v1)

> This paper presents the results of a series of penetration tests performed on the OpenStack Essex Cloud Management Software. Several different types of penetration tests were performed including network protocol and command line fuzzing, session hijacking and credential theft. Using these techniques exploitable vulnerabilities were discovered that could enable an attacker to gain access to restricted information contained on the OpenStack server, or to gain full administrative privileges on the server. Key recommendations to address these vulnerabilities are to use a secure protocol, such as HTTPS, for communications between a cloud user and the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard, to encrypt all files that store user or administrative login credentials, and to correct a software bug found in the OpenStack Cinder typedelete command.

- `1110.5794v6` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5794v6) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.5794v6)

> Anonymity networks hide user identities with the help of relayed anonymity routers. However, the state-of-the-art anonymity networks do not provide an effective trust model. As a result, users cannot circumvent malicious or vulnerable routers, thus making them susceptible to malicious router based attacks (e.g., correlation attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel social network based trust model to help anonymity networks circumvent malicious routers and obtain secure anonymity. In particular, we design an input independent fuzzy model to determine trust relationships between friends based on qualitative and quantitative social attributes, both of which can be readily obtained from existing social networks. Moreover, we design an algorithm for propagating trust over an anonymity network. We integrate these two elements in STor, a novel social network based Tor. We have implemented STor by modifying the Tor's source code and conducted experiments on PlanetLab to evaluate the effectiveness of STor. Both simulation and PlanetLab experiment results have demonstrated that STor can achieve secure anonymity by establishing trust-based circuits in a distributed way. Although the design of STor is based on Tor network, the social network based trust model can be adopted by other anonymity networks.

> Wireless sensor networks have attracted a lot of interest over the last decade in wireless and mobile computing research community. Applications of these networks are numerous and growing, which range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office to outdoor deployment in adversary's territory in a tactical battleground. However, due to distributed nature and their deployment in remote areas, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their performance. This chapter provides a comprehensive discussion on the state of the art in security technologies for wireless sensor networks. It identifies various possible attacks at different layers of the communication protocol stack in a typical sensor network and their possible countermeasures. A brief discussion on the future direction of research in WSN security is also included.

- `1302.0939v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0939v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.0939v1)

> This book chapter identifies various security threats in wireless mesh network (WMN). Keeping in mind the critical requirement of security and user privacy in WMNs, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of various possible attacks on different layers of the communication protocol stack for WMNs and their corresponding defense mechanisms. First, it identifies the security vulnerabilities in the physical, link, network, transport, application layers. Furthermore, various possible attacks on the key management protocols, user authentication and access control protocols, and user privacy preservation protocols are presented. After enumerating various possible attacks, the chapter provides a detailed discussion on various existing security mechanisms and protocols to defend against and wherever possible prevent the possible attacks. Comparative analyses are also presented on the security schemes with regards to the cryptographic schemes used, key management strategies deployed, use of any trusted third party, computation and communication overhead involved etc. The chapter then presents a brief discussion on various trust management approaches for WMNs since trust and reputation-based schemes are increasingly becoming popular for enforcing security in wireless networks. A number of open problems in security and privacy issues for WMNs are subsequently discussed before the chapter is finally concluded.

<summary>2013-02-06 12:23:14 - Source Code Analysis to Remove Security Vulnerabilities in Java Socket Programs: A Case Study</summary>

- *Natarajan Meghanathan*

- `1302.1338v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1338v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.1338v1)

> This paper presents the source code analysis of a file reader server socket program (connection-oriented sockets) developed in Java, to illustrate the identification, impact analysis and solutions to remove five important software security vulnerabilities, which if left unattended could severely impact the server running the software and also the network hosting the server. The five vulnerabilities we study in this paper are: (1) Resource Injection, (2) Path Manipulation, (3) System Information Leak, (4) Denial of Service and (5) Unreleased Resource vulnerabilities. We analyze the reason why each of these vulnerabilities occur in the file reader server socket program, discuss the impact of leaving them unattended in the program, and propose solutions to remove each of these vulnerabilities from the program. We also analyze any potential performance tradeoffs (such as increase in code size and loss of features) that could arise while incorporating the proposed solutions on the server program. The proposed solutions are very generic in nature, and can be suitably modified to correct any such vulnerabilities in software developed in any other programming language. We use the Fortify Source Code Analyzer to conduct the source code analysis of the file reader server program, implemented on a Windows XP virtual machine with the standard J2SE v.7 development kit.

- `1301.7643v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7643v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.7643v2)

> Phishing attacks have become an increasing threat to online users. Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to respond to them. Our study examines the correlation between the Big Five personality traits and email phishing response. We also examine how these factors affect users behavior on Facebook, including posting personal information and choosing Facebook privacy settings.   Our research shows that when using a prize phishing email, we find a strong correlation between gender and the response to the phishing email. In addition, we find that the neuroticism is the factor most correlated to responding to this email. Our study also found that people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings, which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition, our work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of the phishing risks and that realtime response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by online users.   We believe that better understanding of the traits which contribute to online vulnerability can help develop methods for increasing users privacy and security in the future.

- `1302.2253v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2253v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.2253v1)

> Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted a lot of interest in the research community due to their potential applicability in a wide range of real-world practical applications. However, due to the distributed nature and their deployments in critical applications without human interventions and sensitivity and criticality of data communicated, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security and privacy threats that can adversely affect their performance. These issues become even more critical in cognitive wireless sensor networks (CWSNs) in which the sensor nodes have the capabilities of changing their transmission and reception parameters according to the radio environment under which they operate in order to achieve reliable and efficient communication and optimum utilization of the network resources. This chapter presents a comprehensive discussion on the security and privacy issues in CWSNs by identifying various security threats in these networks and various defense mechanisms to counter these vulnerabilities. Various types of attacks on CWSNs are categorized under different classes based on their natures and targets, and corresponding to each attack class, appropriate security mechanisms are also discussed. Some critical research issues on security and privacy in CWSNs are also identified.

<summary>2013-02-17 23:19:52 - The (Un)Reliability of NVD Vulnerable Versions Data: an Empirical Experiment on Google Chrome Vulnerabilities</summary>

- *Viet Hung Nguyen, Fabio Massacci*

- `1302.4133v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4133v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4133v1)

> NVD is one of the most popular databases used by researchers to conduct empirical research on data sets of vulnerabilities. Our recent analysis on Chrome vulnerability data reported by NVD has revealed an abnormally phenomenon in the data where almost vulnerabilities were originated from the first versions. This inspires our experiment to validate the reliability of the NVD vulnerable version data. In this experiment, we verify for each version of Chrome that NVD claims vulnerable is actually vulnerable. The experiment revealed several errors in the vulnerability data of Chrome. Furthermore, we have also analyzed how these errors might impact the conclusions of an empirical study on foundational vulnerability. Our results show that different conclusions could be obtained due to the data errors.

- `1302.4882v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4882v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4882v1)

> A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of autonomous nodes that communicate with each other by forming a multi-hop radio network and maintaining connections in a decentralized manner. Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Protecting the network layer of a MANET from malicious attacks is an important and challenging security issue, since most of the routing protocols for MANETs are vulnerable to various types of attacks. Ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) is a very popular routing algorithm. However, it is vulnerable to the well-known black hole attack, where a malicious node falsely advertises good paths to a destination node during the route discovery process but drops all packets in the data forwarding phase. This attack becomes more severe when a group of malicious nodes cooperate each other. The proposed mechanism does not apply any cryptographic primitives on the routing messages. Instead, it protects the network by detecting and reacting to malicious activities of the nodes. Simulation results show that the scheme has a significantly high detection rate with moderate network traffic overhead and computation overhead in the nodes.

> A password composition policy restricts the space of allowable passwords to eliminate weak passwords that are vulnerable to statistical guessing attacks. Usability studies have demonstrated that existing password composition policies can sometimes result in weaker password distributions; hence a more principled approach is needed. We introduce the first theoretical model for optimizing password composition policies. We study the computational and sample complexity of this problem under different assumptions on the structure of policies and on users' preferences over passwords. Our main positive result is an algorithm that -- with high probability --- constructs almost optimal policies (which are specified as a union of subsets of allowed passwords), and requires only a small number of samples of users' preferred passwords. We complement our theoretical results with simulations using a real-world dataset of 32 million passwords.

> The rapid proliferation of wireless networks and mobile computing applications has changed the landscape of network security,the wireless networks have changed the way business, organizations work and offered a new range of possibilities and flexibilities; It is clear that wireless solutions are transforming the way we work and live. Employees are able to keep in touch with their e-mail, calendar and employer from mobile devices, but on the other hands they introduced a new security threats appeared. While an attacker needs physical access to a wired network in order to gain access to the network and to accomplish his goals, a wireless network allows anyone within its range to passively monitor the traffic or even start an attack,one of the countermeasures that can be used is the intrusion detection systems in order to allow us to know both the threats affecting our wireless network and our system vulnerabilities in order to prevent those attackers, the IDS its main purpose is to manage the system and its operations and Its duty depends on .

> We point out that arguments for the security of Kish's noise-based cryptographic protocol have relied on an unphysical no-wave limit, which if taken seriously would prevent any correlation from developing between the users. We introduce a noiseless version of the protocol, also having illusory security in the no-wave limit, to show that noise and thermodynamics play no essential role. Then we prove generally that classical electromagnetic protocols cannot establish a secret key between two parties separated by a spacetime region perfectly monitored by an eavesdropper. We note that the original protocol of Kish is vulnerable to passive time-correlation attacks even in the quasi-static limit. Finally we show that protocols of this type can be secure in practice against an eavesdropper with noisy monitoring equipment. In this case the security is a straightforward consequence of Maurer and Wolf's discovery that key can be distilled by public discussion from correlated random variables in a wide range of situations where the eavesdropper's noise is at least partly independent from the users' noise.

> Due to delay and energy constraints, a cognitive radio may not be able to perform spectrum sensing in all available channels. Therefore, a sensing policy is needed to decide which channels to sense. The channel selection problem is the problem of designing such a sensing policy to maximize throughput while avoiding interference to primary users. The channel selection problem can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Channel selection schemes that employ reinforcement machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to belief manipulation attacks that contaminate the knowledge base of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we analyze the security of channel selection algorithms that are based on reinforcement learning and propose mitigation techniques that make these algorithms more robust against belief manipulation attacks.

- `1304.0844v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0844v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0844v1)

> Schulze's rule is used in the elections of a large number of organizations including Wikimedia and Debian. Part of the reason for its popularity is the large number of axiomatic properties, like monotonicity and Condorcet consistency, which it satisfies. We identify a potential shortcoming of Schulze's rule: it is computationally vulnerable to manipulation. In particular, we prove that computing an unweighted coalitional manipulation (UCM) is polynomial for any number of manipulators. This result holds for both the unique winner and the co-winner versions of UCM. This resolves an open question stated by Parkes and Xia (2012). We also prove that computing a weighted coalitional manipulation (WCM) is polynomial for a bounded number of candidates. Finally, we discuss the relation between the unique winner UCM problem and the co-winner UCM problem and argue that they have substantially different necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a successful manipulation.

> Intrusion Detection and/or Prevention Systems (IDPS) represent an important line of defence against a variety of attacks that can compromise the security and proper functioning of an enterprise information system. Along with the widespread evolution of new emerging services, the quantity and impact of attacks have continuously increased, attackers continuously find vulnerabilities at various levels, from the network itself to operating system and applications, exploit them to crack system and services. Network defence and network monitoring has become an essential component of computer security to predict and prevent attacks. Unlike traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) have additional features to secure computer networks. In this paper, we present a detailed study of how deployment of an IDPS plays a key role in its performance and the ability to detect and prevent known as well as unknown attacks. We categorize IDPS based on deployment as Network-based, host-based, and Perimeter-based and Hybrid. A detailed comparison is shown in this paper and finally we justify our proposed solution, which deploys agents at host-level to give better performance in terms of reduced rate of false positives and accurate detection and prevention.

> The fusion of social networks and wearable sensors is becoming increasingly popular, with systems like Fitbit automating the process of reporting and sharing user fitness data. In this paper we show that while compelling, the integration of health data into social networks is fraught with privacy and security vulnerabilities. Case in point, by reverse engineering the communication protocol, storage details and operation codes, we identified several vulnerabilities in Fitbit. We have built FitBite, a suite of tools that exploit these vulnerabilities to launch a wide range of attacks against Fitbit. Besides eavesdropping, injection and denial of service, several attacks can lead to rewards and financial gains. We have built FitLock, a lightweight defense system that protects Fitbit while imposing only a small overhead. Our experiments on BeagleBoard and Xperia devices show that FitLock's end-to-end overhead over Fitbit is only 2.4%.

Math., vol. 6(2), pp.258-264, 2007.], introduced a modified public-key encryption scheme with steganographic approach for security in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. In this cryptosystem, Akleylek et al. attempt to increase security of the P2P networks by mixing ElGamal cryptosystem with knapsack problem. In this paper, we present a ciphertext-only attack against their system to recover message. In addition, we show that for their scheme completeness property is not holds, and therefore, the receiver cannot uniquely decrypts messages. Furthermore, we also show that this system is not chosen-ciphertext secure, thus the proposed scheme is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle-attack, one of the most pernicious attacks against P2P networks. Therefore, this scheme is not suitable to implement in the P2P networks.   We modify this cryptosystem in order to increase its security and efficiency. Our construction is the efficient CCA2-secure variant of the Akleylek et al.'s encryption scheme in the standard model, the de facto security notion for public-key encryption schemes.

> WebView is an essential component in Android and iOS. It enables applications to display content from on-line resources. It simplifies task of performing a network request, parsing the data and rendering it. WebView uses a number of APIs which can interact with the web contents inside WebView. In the current paper, Cross-site scripting attacks or XSS attacks specific to Android WebView are discussed. Cross site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability commonly found in web applications. This vulnerability makes it possible for attackers to run malicious code into victim's WebView,through HttpClient APIs. Using this malicious code, the attackers can steal the victim's credentials, such as cookies. The access control policies (that is,the same origin policy) employed by the browser to protect those credentials can be bypassed by exploiting the XSS vulnerability.

These profiles contain medical and genomic information, including details about medications, procedures and diseases, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, and postal code. By linking demographics to public records such as voter lists, and mining for names hidden in attached documents, we correctly identified 84 to 97 percent of the profiles for which we provided names. Our ability to learn their names is based on their demographics, not their DNA, thereby revisiting an old vulnerability that could be easily thwarted with minimal loss of research value. So, we propose technical remedies for people to learn about their demographics to make better decisions.

> Smart energy grid is an emerging area for new applications of machine learning in a non-stationary environment. Such a non-stationary environment emerges when large-scale failures occur at power distribution networks due to external disturbances such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution networks lie at the edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external disruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn non-stationary behaviors of large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution. This work studies such non-stationary behaviors in three aspects. First, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of failure and recovery of power distribution are developed as geo-location based multivariate non-stationary GI(t)/G(t)/Infinity queues. Third, the non-stationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to be learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale disruptions. One is from Hurricane Ike, where data from an operational network is exact on failures and recoveries. The other is from Hurricane Sandy, where aggregated data is used for inferring failure and recovery processes at one of the impacted areas. Model parameters are learned using real data. Two findings emerge as results of learning: (a) Failure rates behave similarly at the two different provider networks for two different hurricanes but differently at the geographical regions. (b) Both rapid- and slow-recovery are present for Hurricane Ike but only slow recovery is shown for a regional distribution network from Hurricane Sandy.

> We present a second iteration of a machine learning approach to static code analysis and fingerprinting for weaknesses related to security, software engineering, and others using the open-source MARF framework and the MARFCAT application based on it for the NIST's SATE IV static analysis tool exposition workshop's data sets that include additional test cases, including new large synthetic cases. To aid detection of weak or vulnerable code, including source or binary on different platforms the machine learning approach proved to be fast and accurate to for such tasks where other tools are either much slower or have much smaller recall of known vulnerabilities. We use signal and NLP processing techniques in our approach to accomplish the identification and classification tasks. MARFCAT's design from the beginning in 2010 made is independent of the language being analyzed, source code, bytecode, or binary. In this follow up work with explore some preliminary results in this area. We evaluated also additional algorithms that were used to process the data.

> Auctions have a long history, having been recorded as early as 500 B.C. Nowadays, electronic auctions have been a great success and are increasingly used. Many cryptographic protocols have been proposed to address the various security requirements of these electronic transactions, in particular to ensure privacy. Brandt developed a protocol that computes the winner using homomorphic operations on a distributed ElGamal encryption of the bids. He claimed that it ensures full privacy of the bidders, i.e. no information apart from the winner and the winning price is leaked. We first show that this protocol -- when using malleable interactive zero-knowledge proofs -- is vulnerable to attacks by dishonest bidders. Such bidders can manipulate the publicly available data in a way that allows the seller to deduce all participants' bids. Additionally we discuss some issues with verifiability as well as attacks on non-repudiation, fairness and the privacy of individual bidders exploiting authentication problems.

- `1305.3883v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3883v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.3883v1)

> In this paper, we present a hybrid approach for buffer overflow detection in C code. The approach makes use of static and dynamic analysis of the application under investigation. The static part consists in calculating taint dependency sequences (TDS) between user controlled inputs and vulnerable statements. This process is akin to program slice of interest to calculate tainted data- and control-flow path which exhibits the dependence between tainted program inputs and vulnerable statements in the code. The dynamic part consists of executing the program along TDSs to trigger the vulnerability by generating suitable inputs. We use genetic algorithm to generate inputs. We propose a fitness function that approximates the program behavior (control flow) based on the frequencies of the statements along TDSs. This runtime aspect makes the approach faster and accurate. We provide experimental results on the Verisec benchmark to validate our approach.

- `1208.0412v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0412v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.0412v2)

> Comparing to well protected data frames, Wi-Fi management frames (MFs) are extremely vulnerable to various attacks. Since MFs are transmitted without encryption, attackers can forge them easily. Such attacks can be detected in cooperative environment such as Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS). However, in non-cooperative environment it is difficult for a single station to identify these spoofing attacks using Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based detection, due to the strong correlation of RSS to both the transmission power (Txpower) and the location of the sender.   By exploiting some unique characteristics (i.e., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of the Channel State Information (CSI), a standard feature in 802.11n Specification, we design a prototype, called CSITE, to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames by a single station without external support. Our design CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance finger-print. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we implement a prototype of our design and conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency: we observe about 8 times improvement by CSITE over RSS-based method on the falsely accepted attacking frames.

- `1305.6350v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6350v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6350v1)

> Recently, Li et al. analyzed Lee et al.'s multi-server authentication scheme and proposed a novel smart card and dynamic ID based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environments. They claimed that their scheme can resist several kinds of attacks. However, through careful analysis, we find that Li et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to stolen smart card and offline dictionary attack, replay attack, impersonation attack and server spoofing attack. By analyzing other similar schemes, we find that the certain type of dynamic ID based multi-server authentication scheme in which only hash functions are used and no registration center participates in the authentication and session key agreement phase is hard to provide perfect efficient and secure authentication. To compensate for these shortcomings, we improve the recently proposed Liao et al.'s multi-server authentication scheme which is based on pairing and self-certified public keys, and propose a novel dynamic ID based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environments. Liao et al.'s scheme is found vulnerable to offline dictionary attack and denial of service attack, and cannot provide user's anonymity and local password verification. However, our proposed scheme overcomes the shortcomings of Liao et al.'s scheme. Security and performance analyses show the proposed scheme is secure against various attacks and has many excellent features.

> The trend toward a highly mobile workforce and the ubiquity of graphical interfaces (such as the stylus and touch-screen) has enabled the emergence of graphical authentications in Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) [1]. However, most of the current graphical password schemes are vulnerable to shoulder-surfing [2,3], a known risk where an attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the authentication session. Several approaches have been developed to deal with this problem, but they have significant usability drawbacks, usually in the time and effort to log in, making them less suitable for authentication [4, 8]. For example, it is time-consuming for users to log in CHC [4] and there are complex text memory requirements in scheme proposed by Hong [5]. With respect to the scheme proposed by Weinshall [6], not only is it intricate to log in, but also the main claim of resisting shoulder-surfing is proven false [7]. In this paper, we introduce a new graphical password scheme which provides a good resistance to shouldersurfing and preserves a desirable usability.

> A precise vulnerability discovery model (VDM) will provide a useful insight to assess software security, and could be a good prediction instrument for both software vendors and users to understand security trends and plan ahead patching schedule accordingly. Thus far, several models have been proposed and validated. Yet, no systematically independent validation by somebody other than the author exists. Furthermore, there are a number of issues that might bias previous studies in the field. In this work, we fill in the gap by introducing an empirical methodology that systematically evaluates the performance of a VDM in two aspects: quality and predictability. We further apply this methodology to assess existing VDMs. The results show that some models should be rejected outright, while some others might be adequate to capture the discovery process of vulnerabilities. We also consider different usage scenarios of VDMs and find that the simplest linear model is the most appropriate choice in terms of both quality and predictability when browsers are young. Otherwise, logistics-based models are better choices.

> In today's world, Web applications play a very important role in individual life as well as in any country's development. Web applications have gone through a very rapid growth in the recent years and their adoption is moving faster than that was expected few years ago. Now-a-days, billions of transactions are done online with the aid of different Web applications. Though these applications are used by hundreds of people, in many cases the security level is weak, which makes them vulnerable to get compromised. In most of the scenarios, a user has to be identified before any communication is established with the backend database. An arbitrary user should not be allowed access to the system without proof of valid credentials. However, a crafted injection gives access to unauthorized users. This is mostly accomplished via SQL Injection input. In spite of the development of different approaches to prevent SQL injection, it still remains an alarming threat to Web applications. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on various types of SQL Injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and their prevention techniques. Alongside presenting our findings from the study, we also note down future expectations and possible development of countermeasures against SQL Injection attacks.

> Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are often deployed in hostile environments, which make such networks highly vulnerable and increase the risk of attacks against this type of network. WSN comprise of large number of sensor nodes with different hardware abilities and functions. Due to the limited memory resources and energy constraints, complex security algorithms cannot be used in sensor networks. Therefore, it is necessary to balance between the security level and the associated energy consumption overhead to mitigate the security risks. Hierarchical routing protocol is more energy-efficient than other routing protocols in WSNs. Many secure cluster-based routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to overcome these constraints. In this paper, we discuss Secure Energy-Efficient Hierarchical Routing Protocols in WSNs and compare them in terms of security, performance and efficiency. Security issues for WSNs and their solutions are also discussed.

To remedy these weaknesses, in this paper we propose a novel anonymous authentication scheme for roaming service in global mobility networks. Security and performance analyses show the proposed scheme is more suitable for the low-power and resource-limited mobile devices, and is secure against various attacks and has many excellent features.

> In electronic marketplaces, after each transaction buyers will rate the products provided by the sellers. To decide the most trustworthy sellers to transact with, buyers rely on trust models to leverage these ratings to evaluate the reputation of sellers. Although the high effectiveness of different trust models for handling unfair ratings have been claimed by their designers, recently it is argued that these models are vulnerable to more intelligent attacks, and there is an urgent demand that the robustness of the existing trust models has to be evaluated in a more comprehensive way. In this work, we classify the existing trust models into two broad categories and propose an extendable e-marketplace testbed to evaluate their robustness against different unfair rating attacks comprehensively. On top of highlighting the robustness of the existing trust models for handling unfair ratings is far from what they were claimed to be, we further propose and validate a novel combination mechanism for the existing trust models, Discount-then-Filter, to notably enhance their robustness against the investigated attacks.

> The DC-nets approach to anonymity has long held attraction for its strength against traffic analysis, but practical implementations remain vulnerable to internal disruption or "jamming" attacks requiring time-consuming tracing procedures to address. We present Verdict, the first practical anonymous group communication system built using proactively verifiable DC-nets: participants use public key cryptography to construct DC-net ciphertexts, and knowledge proofs to detect and detect and exclude misbehavior before disruption. We compare three alternative constructions for verifiable DC-nets, one using bilinear maps and two based on simpler ElGamal encryption. While verifiable DC-nets incurs higher computation overheads due to the public-key cryptography involved, our experiments suggest Verdict is practical for anonymous group messaging or microblogging applications, supporting groups of 100 clients at 1 second per round or 1000 clients at 10 seconds per round. Furthermore, we show how existing symmetric-key DC-nets can "fall back" to a verifiable DC-net to quickly identify mis- behavior improving previous detections schemes by two orders of magnitude than previous approaches.

> Recent studies have shown that a significant number of mobile applications, often handling sensitive data such as bank accounts and login credentials, suffers from SSL vulnerabilities. Most of the time, these vulnerabilities are due to improper use of the SSL protocol (in particular, in its \emph{handshake} phase), resulting in applications exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, we present MITHYS, a system able to: (i) detect applications vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, and (ii) protect them against these attacks. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal by means of a prototype implementation in Android, named MITHYSApp. A thorough set of experiments assesses the validity of our solution in detecting and protecting mobile applications from man-in-the-middle attacks, without introducing significant overheads. Finally, MITHYSApp does not require any special permissions nor OS modifications, as it operates at the application level. These features make MITHYSApp immediately deployable on a large user base.

With the emergence of the first large-scale mobile botnets, the core network has also become vulnerable to distributed denial-of-service attacks such as the signaling attack. Furthermore, complementary access methods such as Wi-Fi and femtocells introduce additional vulnerabilities for the mobile users as well as the core network.

> As the rollout of secure route origin authentication with the RPKI slowly gains traction among network operators, there is a push to standardize secure path validation for BGP (i.e., S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in "partial deployment" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.

> An infrastructure network is a self-organizing network with help of Access Point (AP) of wireless links connecting nodes to another. The nodes can communicate without an ad hoc. They form an uninformed topology (BSS/ESS), where the nodes play the role of routers and are free to move randomly. Infrastructure networks proved their efficiency being used in different fields but they are highly vulnerable to security attacks and dealing with this is one of the main challenges of these networks at present. In recent times some clarification are proposed to provide authentication, confidentiality, availability, secure routing and intrusion avoidance in infrastructure networks. Implementing security in such dynamically changing networks is a hard task. Infrastructure network characteristics should be taken into consideration to be clever to design efficient solutions. Here we spotlight on civilizing the flow transmission privacy in infrastructure networks based on multipath routing. Certainly, we take benefit of the being of multiple paths between nodes in an infrastructure network to increase the confidentiality robustness of transmitted data with the help of Access Point. In our approach the original message to secure is split into shares through access point that are encrypted and combined then transmitted along different disjointed existing paths between sender and receiver. Even if an intruder achieve something to get one or more transmitted distribute the likelihood that the unique message will be reconstituted is very squat.

> An ad hoc network is a self-organizing network with help of Access Point (AP) of wireless links connecting nodes to another. The nodes can communicate without infrastructure network. They form an random topology (BSS/ESS), where the nodes play the role of routers and are free to move arbitrarily. Ad hoc networks confirmed their efficiency being used in different fields but they are highly vulnerable to security attacks and dealing with this is one of the main challenges of these networks today. In recent times, a few solutions are proposed to provide authentication, confidentiality, availability, secure routing and intrusion prevention in ad hoc networks. Employ security in such dynamically changing networks is a hard task. Ad hoc network uniqueness must be taken into contemplation to be clever to design efficient clarification. Here we spotlight on improving the flow transmission confidentiality in ad hoc networks based on unipath routing. Definitely, we take advantage of the being of multiple paths between nodes in an ad hoc network to increase the confidentiality robustness of transmitted data with the help of Access Point. In our approach the original message to secure is split into shares through access point that are encrypted and combined then transmitted along different disjointed existing paths between sender and receiver. Still if an attacker succeeds to attain one or more transmitted contribute to the probability that the unique message will be reconstituted is very low.

> Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are deployed on most present server, desktop, and even mobile platforms. Nowadays, a growing number of applications leverage the high parallelism offered by this architecture to speed-up general purpose computation. This phenomenon is called GPGPU computing (General Purpose GPU computing). The aim of this work is to discover and highlight security issues related to CUDA, the most widespread platform for GPGPU computing. In particular, we provide details and proofs-of-concept about a novel set of vulnerabilities CUDA architectures are subject to, that could be exploited to cause severe information leak. Following (detailed) intuitions rooted on sound engineering security, we performed several experiments targeting the last two generations of CUDA devices: Fermi and Kepler. We discovered that these two families do suffer from information leakage vulnerabilities. In particular, some vulnerabilities are shared between the two architectures, while others are idiosyncratic of the Kepler architecture. As a case study, we report the impact of one of these vulnerabilities on a GPU implementation of the AES encryption algorithm. We also suggest software patches and alternative approaches to tackle the presented vulnerabilities. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work showing that information leakage in CUDA is possible using just standard CUDA instructions. We expect our work to pave the way for further research in the field.

> Recently efficient model-checking tools have been developed to find flaws in security protocols specifications. These flaws can be interpreted as potential attacks scenarios but the feasability of these scenarios need to be confirmed at the implementation level. However, bridging the gap between an abstract attack scenario derived from a specification and a penetration test on real implementations of a protocol is still an open issue. This work investigates an architecture for automatically generating abstract attacks and converting them to concrete tests on protocol implementations. In particular we aim to improve previously proposed blackbox testing methods in order to discover automatically new attacks and vulnerabilities. As a proof of concept we have experimented our proposed architecture to detect a renegotiation vulnerability on some implementations of SSL/TLS, a protocol widely used for securing electronic transactions.

> Wireless sensor networks have emerged as an important and new area in wireless and mobile computing research because of their numerous potential applications that range from indoor deployment scenarios in home and office to outdoor deployment in adversary's territory in tactical battleground. Since in many WSN applications, lives and livelihoods may depend on the timeliness and correctness of sensor data obtained from dispersed sensor nodes, these networks must be secured to prevent any possible attacks that may be launched on them. Security is, therefore, an important issue in WSNs. However, this issue becomes even more critical in cognitive wireless sensor networks, a type of WSN in which the sensor nodes have the capabilities of changing their transmission and reception parameters according to the radio environment under which they operate in order to achieve reliable and efficient communication and optimum utilization of the network resources. This survey paper presents a comprehensive discussion on various security issues in CWSNs by identifying numerous security threats in these networks and defense mechanisms to counter these vulnerabilities. Various types of attacks on CWSNs are categorized under different classes based on their natures and tragets, and corresponding to each attack class, appropriate security mechanisms are presented. The paper also identifies some open problems in this emerging area of wireless networking.

> Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become popular as a new paradigm for information exchange and are being used in many applications such as file sharing, distributed computing, video conference, VoIP, radio and TV broadcasting. This popularity comes with security implications and vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. Especially duo to direct communication between two end nodes in P2P networks, these networks are potentially vulnerable to "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks. In this paper, we propose a new public-key cryptosystem for P2P networks that is robust against Man-in-the-Middle adversary. This cryptosystem is based on RSA and knapsack problems. Our precoding-based algorithm uses knapsack problem for performing permutation and padding random data to the message. We show that comparing to other proposed cryptosystems, our algorithm is more efficient and it is fully secure against an active adversary.

> Cloud Computing is a recent computing model provides consistent access to wide area distributed resources. It revolutionized the IT world with its services provision infrastructure, less maintenance cost, data and service availability assurance, rapid accessibility and scalability. Grid and Cloud Computing Intrusion Detection System detects encrypted node communication and find the hidden attack trial which inspects and detects those attacks that network based and host based cant identify. It incorporates Knowledge and behavior analysis to identify specific intrusions. Signature based IDS monitor the packets in the network and identifies those threats by matching with database but It fails to detect those attacks that are not included in database. Signature based IDS will perform poor capturing in large volume of anomalies. Another problem is that Cloud Service Provider hides the attack that is caused by intruder, due to distributed nature cloud environment has high possibility for vulnerable resources. By impersonating legitimate users, the intruders can use a services abundant resources maliciously. In Proposed System we combine few concepts which are available with new intrusion detection techniques. Here to merge Entropy based System with Anomaly detection System for providing multilevel Distributed Denial of Service. This is done in two steps: First, Users are allowed to pass through router in network site in that it incorporates Detection Algorithm and detects for legitimate user. Second, again it pass through router placed in cloud site in that it incorporates confirmation Algorithm and checks for threshold value, if its beyond the threshold value it considered as legitimate user, else its an intruder found in environment.

> To encourage users to use stronger and more secure passwords, modern web browsers offer users password management services, allowing users to save previously entered passwords locally onto their hard drives. We present Lupin, a tool that automatically extracts these saved passwords without the user's knowledge. Lupin allows a network adversary to obtain passwords as long as the login form appears on a non-HTTPS page. Unlike existing password sniffing tools, Lupin can obtain passwords for websites users are not visiting. Furthermore, Lupin can extract passwords embedded in login forms with a destination address served in HTTPS. To determine the number of websites vulnerable to our attack, we crawled the top 45,000 most popular websites from Alexa's top website list and discovered that at least 28% of these sites are vulnerable. To further demonstrate the feasibility of our attack, we tested Lupin under controlled conditions using one of the authors' computers. Lupin was able to extract passwords from 1,000 websites in less than 35 seconds. We suggest techniques for web developers to protect their web applications from attack, and we propose alternative designs for a secure password manager.

> In its Vision and Strategy for Software for Science, Engineering, and Education the NSF states that it will invest in activities that: "Recognize that software strategies must include the secure and reliable deployment and operation of services, for example by campuses or national facilities or industry, where identity, authentication, authorization and assurance are crucial operational capabilities." and "Result in high-quality, usable, secure, vulnerability-free, sustainable, robust, well-tested, and maintainable/evolvable software; and which promotes the sustainability of solid and useful on-going investments."   Such statements evidence that security should indeed be a first-class consideration of the software ecosystem. In this position paper, we share some thoughts related to research software security. Our thoughts are based on the observation that security is not a binary, all-or-nothing attribute, but a range of practices and requirements depending on how the software is expected to be deployed and used. We propose that the community leverage the concept of a maturity model, and work to agree on a research software security maturity model. This model would categorize different sets of security needs of the deployment community, and provide software developers a roadmap for advancing the security maturity of their software. The intent of this paper is not to express such a comprehensive maturity model, but instead to start a conversation and set some initial requirements.

> Remote user authentication is desirable for a Telecare medicine information system (TMIS) to verify the correctness of remote users. In 2013, Jiang et al. proposed privacy preserving authentication scheme for TMIS. Recently, Wu and Xu analyzed Jiang's scheme and identify serious security flaws in their scheme, namely, user impersonation attack, DoS attack and off-line password guessing attack. In this article, we analyze Wu and Xu's scheme and show that their scheme is also vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack and does not protect user anonymity. Moreover, we identify the inefficiency of incorrect input detection of the login phase in Wu and Xu's scheme, where the smart card executes the login session in-spite of wrong input.

> (U.S) Rule-based policies to mitigate software risk suggest to use the CVSS score to measure the individual vulnerability risk and act accordingly: an HIGH CVSS score according to the NVD (National (U.S.) Vulnerability Database) is therefore translated into a "Yes". A key issue is whether such rule is economically sensible, in particular if reported vulnerabilities have been actually exploited in the wild, and whether the risk score do actually match the risk of actual exploitation.   We compare the NVD dataset with two additional datasets, the EDB for the white market of vulnerabilities (such as those present in Metasploit), and the EKITS for the exploits traded in the black market. We benchmark them against Symantec's threat explorer dataset (SYM) of actual exploit in the wild. We analyze the whole spectrum of CVSS submetrics and use these characteristics to perform a case-controlled analysis of CVSS scores (similar to those used to link lung cancer and smoking) to test its reliability as a risk factor for actual exploitation.   We conclude that (a) fixing just because a high CVSS score in NVD only yields negligible risk reduction, (b) the additional existence of proof of concepts exploits (e.g. in EDB) may yield some additional but not large risk reduction, (c) fixing in response to presence in black markets yields the equivalent risk reduction of wearing safety belt in cars (you might also die but still..). On the negative side, our study shows that as industry we miss a metric with high specificity (ruling out vulns for which we shouldn't worry).   In order to address the feedback from BlackHat 2013's audience, the final revision (V3) provides additional data in Appendix A detailing how the control variables in the study affect the results.

> Existing captcha solutions on the Internet are a major source of user frustration. Game captchas are an interesting and, to date, little-studied approach claiming to make captcha solving a fun activity for the users. One broad form of such captchas -- called Dynamic Cognitive Game (DCG) captchas -- challenge the user to perform a game-like cognitive task interacting with a series of dynamic images. We pursue a comprehensive analysis of a representative category of DCG captchas. We formalize, design and implement such captchas, and dissect them across: (1) fully automated attacks, (2) human-solver relay attacks, and (3) usability. Our results suggest that the studied DCG captchas exhibit high usability and, unlike other known captchas, offer some resistance to relay attacks, but they are also vulnerable to our novel dictionary-based automated attack.

In order to facilitate timely discovery of such knowledge, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm, PACE, for identifying and classifying relevant entities in text sources. The main contribution of this paper is an enhancement of the traditional bootstrapping method for entity extraction by employing a time-memory trade-off that simultaneously circumvents a costly corpus search while strengthening pattern nomination, which should increase accuracy. An implementation in the cyber-security domain is discussed as well as challenges to Natural Language Processing imposed by the security domain.

> Wireless sensor network comprises of small sensor nodes with limited resources. Clustered networks have been proposed in many researches to reduce the power consumption in sensor networks. LEACH is one of the most interested techniques that offer an efficient way to minimize the power consumption in sensor networks. However, due to the characteristics of restricted resources and operation in a hostile environment, WSNs are subjected to numerous threats and are vulnerable to attacks. This research proposes a solution that can be applied on LEACH to increase the level of security. In Watchdog-LEACH, some nodes are considered as watchdogs and some changes are applied on LEACH protocol for intrusion detection. Watchdog-LEACH is able to protect against a wide range of attacks and it provides security, energy efficiency and memory efficiency. The result of simulation shows that in comparison to LEACH, the energy overhead is about 2% so this method is practical and can be applied to WSNs.

> The Telecare medicine information system (TMIS) is developed to provide Telecare services to the remote user. A user can access remote medical servers using internet without moving from his place. Although remote user and server exchange their messages/data via public networks. An adversary is considered to be enough powerful that he may have full control over the public network. This makes these Telecare services vulnerable to attacks. To ensure secure communication between the user and server many password based authentication schemes have been proposed. In 2013, Hao et al. presented chaotic maps-based password authentication scheme for TMIS. Recently, Lee identified that Hao et al.'s scheme fails to satisfy key agreement property, such that a malicious server can predetermine the session key. Lee also presented an efficient chaotic map-based password authentication and key agreement scheme using Smart cards for TMIS. In this article, we briefly review Lee's scheme and demonstrates the weakness of Lee's scheme. The study shows that the Lee's scheme inefficiency of password change phase causes denial of service attack and login phase results extra computation and communication overhead.

> Cloud Computing has been envisioned as the next generation architecture of IT Enterprise. The Cloud computing concept offers dynamically scalable resources provisioned as a service over the Internet. Economic benefits are the main driver for the Cloud, since it promises the reduction of capital expenditure and operational expenditure. In order for this to become reality, however, there are still some challenges to be solved. Most important among these are security and trust issues,since the users data has to be released to the Cloud and thus leaves the protection sphere of the data owner.In contrast to traditional solutions, where the IT services are under proper physical,logical and personnel controls, Cloud Computing moves the application software and databases to the large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges which have not been well understood. Security is to save data from danger and vulnerability. There are so many dangers and vulnerabilities to be handled. Various security issues and some of their solution are explained and are concentrating mainly on public cloud security issues and their solutions. Data should always be encrypted when stored(using separate symmetric encryption keys)and transmitted. If this is implemented appropriately, even if another tenant can access the data, all that will appear is gibberish. So a method is proposed such that we are encrypting the whole data along with the cryptographic key.

> A significant limitation of current cyber security research and techniques is its reactive and applied nature. This leads to a continuous 'cyber cycle' of attackers scanning networks, developing exploits and attacking systems, with defenders detecting attacks, analyzing exploits and patching systems. This reactive nature leaves sensitive systems highly vulnerable to attack due to un-patched systems and undetected exploits. Some current research attempts to address this major limitation by introducing systems that implement moving target defense. However, these ideas are typically based on the intuition that a moving target defense will make it much harder for attackers to find and scan vulnerable systems, and not on theoretical mathematical foundations. The continuing lack of fundamental science and principles for developing more secure systems has drawn increased interest into establishing a 'science of cyber security'. This paper introduces the concept of using cybernetics, an interdisciplinary approach of control theory, systems theory, information theory and game theory applied to regulatory systems, as a foundational approach for developing cyber security principles. It explores potential applications of cybernetics to cyber security from a defensive perspective, while suggesting the potential use for offensive applications. Additionally, this paper introduces the fundamental principles for building non-stationary systems, which is a more general solution than moving target defenses. Lastly, the paper discusses related works concerning the limitations of moving target defense and one implementation based on non-stationary principles.

> With the rapid advancement of wireless network technology, usage of WSN in real time applications like military, forest monitoring etc. found increasing. Generally WSN operate in an unattended environment and handles critical data. Authenticating the user trying to access the sensor memory is one of the critical requirements. Many researchers have proposed remote user authentication schemes focusing on various parameters. In 2013, Li et al. proposed a temporal-credential-based mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs. Li et al. claimed that their scheme is secure against all major cryptographic attacks and requires less computation cost due to usage of hash function instead encryption operations. Unfortunately, in this paper we will show that their scheme is vulnerable to offline password guessing attack, stolen smart card attack, leakage of password etc. and failure to provide data privacy.

> Multipath routing is the use of multiple potential paths through a network in order to enhance fault tolerance, optimize bandwidth use, and improve security. Selecting data flow paths based on cost addresses performance issues but ignores security threats. Attackers can disrupt the data flows by attacking the links along the paths. Denial-of-service, remote exploitation, and other such attacks launched on any single link can severely limit throughput. Networks can be secured using a secure quality of service approach in which a sender disperses data along multiple secure paths. In this secure multi-path approach, a portion of the data from the sender is transmitted over each path and the receiver assembles the data fragments that arrive. One of the largest challenges in secure multipath routing is determining the security threat level along each path and providing a commensurate level of encryption along that path. The research presented explores the effects of real-world attack scenarios in systems, and gauges the threat levels along each path. Optimal sampling and compression of network data is provided via compressed sensing. The probability of the presence of specific attack signatures along a network path is determined using machine learning techniques. Using these probabilities, information assurance levels are derived such that security measures along vulnerable paths are increased.

> The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, i.e., it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.   We show that the Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.   Selfish mining is feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects against selfish mining pools that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.

> Conventional block-based multicast authentication schemes overlook the heterogeneity of receivers by letting the sender choose the block size, divide a multicast stream into blocks, associate each block with a signature, and spread the effect of the signature across all the packets in the block through hash graphs or coding algorithms. The correlation among packets makes them vulnerable to packet loss, which is inherent in the Internet and wireless networks. Moreover, the lack of Denial of Service (DoS) resilience renders most of them vulnerable to packet injection in hostile environments. In this paper, we propose a novel multicast authentication protocol, namely MABS, including two schemes. The basic scheme (MABS-B) eliminates the correlation among packets and thus provides the perfect resilience to packet loss, and it is also efficient in terms of latency, computation, and communication overhead due to an efficient cryptographic primitive called batch signature, which supports the authentication of any number of packets simultaneously.so we discuss their comparisons and performance evaluation of Packet Loss, Comparisons over Lossy Channels, Comparisons of Signature Schemes, computationational overheads etc.

> With the increasing importance of the internet in our day to day life, data security in web application has become very crucial. Ever increasing on line and real time transaction services have led to manifold rise in the problems associated with the database security. Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web applications input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the users input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take users input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the users input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server. At the proxy server, data cleaning algorithm is triggered using a sanitizing application. In this framework we include detection and sanitization of the tainted information being sent to the database and innovate a new prototype.

> Networked control systems consist of distributed sensors and actuators that communicate via a wireless network. The use of an open wireless medium and unattended deployment leaves these systems vulnerable to intelligent adversaries whose goal is to disrupt the system performance. In this paper, we study the wormhole attack on a networked control system, in which an adversary establishes a link between two distant regions of the network by using either high-gain antennas, as in the out-of-band wormhole, or colluding network nodes as in the in-band wormhole. Wormholes allow the adversary to violate the timing constraints of real-time control systems by delaying or dropping packets, and cannot be detected using cryptographic mechanisms alone. We study the impact of the wormhole attack on the network flows and delays and introduce a passivity-based control-theoretic framework for modeling the wormhole attack. We develop this framework for both the in-band and out-of-band wormhole attacks as well as complex, hereto-unreported wormhole attacks consisting of arbitrary combinations of in-and out-of band wormholes. We integrate existing mitigation strategies into our framework, and analyze the throughput, delay, and stability properties of the overall system. Through simulation study, we show that, by selectively dropping control packets, the wormhole attack can cause disturbances in the physical plant of a networked control system, and demonstrate that appropriate selection of detection parameters mitigates the disturbances due to the wormhole while satisfying the delay constraints of the physical system.

> Voice over IP (VoIP) is the technology allowing voice and multimedia transmissions as data packets over a private or a public IP network. Thanks to the benefits that it may provide, the VoIP technology is increasingly attracting attention and interest in the industry. Actually, VoIP allows significant benefits for customers and communication services providers such as cost savings, rich media service, phone and service portability, mobility, and the integration with other applications. Nevertheless, the deployment of the VoIP technology encounters many challenges such as architecture complexity, interoperability issues, QoS issues, and security concerns. Among these disadvantages, VoIP security issues are becoming more serious because traditional security devices, protocols, and architectures cannot adequately protect VoIP systems from recent intelligent attacks. The aim of this paper is carry out a deep analysis of the security concerns of the VoIP technology. Firstly, we present a brief overview about the VoIP technology. Then, we discuss security attacks and vulnerabilities related to VoIP protocols and devices. After that, we talk about the security profiles of the VoIP protocols, and we present the main security components designed to help the deployment of a reliable and secured VoIP systems.

> In a 2005 IACR report, Wang published an efficient identity-based key agreement protocol (IDAK) suitable for resource constrained devices.   The author shows that the IDAK key agreement protocol is secure in the Bellare-Rogaway model with random oracles and also provides separate ad-hoc security proofs claiming that the IDAK protocol is not vulnerable to Key Compromise Impersonation attacks and also enjoys Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).   In this report, we review the security properties of the protocol and point out that it is vulnerable to Unknown Key Share attacks. Although such attacks are often difficult to setup in a real world environment they are nevertheless interesting from a theoretical point of view so we provide a version of the protocol that fixes the problem in a standard way. We also provide a security proof of the IDAK protocol based on the Gap Bilinear Diffie Hellman and random oracle assumptions in the stronger extended Canetti-Krawczyk security model of distributed computing.

> The smart card based authentication protocols try to ensure secure and authorized communication between remote entities. In 2012, Wei et al. presented an improvement of Wu et al.'s two-factor authentication scheme for TMIS which is proven vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack by Zhu. Zhu also proposed a modified scheme to overcome with weakness of Wei et al.'s scheme, although Lee and Liu showed the failure of his scheme to resist parallel session attacks. Moreover, Lee and Liu introduced an improved scheme. We analyze Wei et al.'s, Zhu's and Lee and Liu's schemes and identify that none of the schemes resist on-line password guessing attack. Moreover, these schemes do not present efficient login and password chance phase. We also show that how inefficient password change phase causes denial of service attack. Further, we propose an improved password based remote user authentication scheme with the aim to eliminate all the drawbacks of previously presented schemes.

> Optical networks are vulnerable to physical layer attacks; wiretappers can improperly receive messages intended for legitimate recipients. Our work considers an aspect of this security problem within the domain of multimode fiber (MMF) transmission. MMF transmission can be modeled via a broadcast channel in which both the legitimate receiver's and wiretapper's channels are multiple-input-multiple-output complex Gaussian channels. Source-channel coding analyses based on the use of distortion as the metric for secrecy are developed. Alice has a source sequence to be encoded and transmitted over this broadcast channel so that the legitimate user Bob can reliably decode while forcing the distortion of wiretapper, or eavesdropper, Eve's estimate as high as possible. Tradeoffs between transmission rate and distortion under two extreme scenarios are examined: the best case where Eve has only her channel output and the worst case where she also knows the past realization of the source. It is shown that under the best case, an operationally separate source-channel coding scheme guarantees maximum distortion at the same rate as needed for reliable transmission. Theoretical bounds are given, and particularized for MMF. Numerical results showing the rate distortion tradeoff are presented and compared with corresponding results for the perfect secrecy case.
