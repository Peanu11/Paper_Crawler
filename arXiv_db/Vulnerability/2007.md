<summary>2007-04-27 01:38:55 - Evaluating Personal Archiving Strategies for Internet-based Information</summary>

> Internet-based personal digital belongings present different vulnerabilities than locally stored materials. We use responses to a survey of people who have recovered lost websites, in combination with supplementary interviews, to paint a fuller picture of current curatorial strategies and practices. We examine the types of personal, topical, and commercial websites that respondents have lost and the reasons they have lost this potentially valuable material. We further explore what they have tried to recover and how the loss influences their subsequent practices. We found that curation of personal digital materials in online stores bears some striking similarities to the curation of similar materials stored locally in that study participants continue to archive personal assets by relying on a combination of benign neglect, sporadic backups, and unsystematic file replication. However, we have also identified issues specific to Internet-based material: how risk is spread by distributing the files among multiple servers and services; the circular reasoning participants use when they discuss the safety of their digital assets; and the types of online material that are particularly vulnerable to loss. The study reveals ways in which expectations of permanence and notification are violated and situations in which benign neglect has far greater consequences for the long-term fate of important digital assets.

<summary>2007-04-27 02:35:57 - The Long Term Fate of Our Digital Belongings: Toward a Service Model for Personal Archives</summary>

- *Catherine C. Marshall, Sara Bly, Francoise Brun-Cottan*

- `0704.3653v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3653v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.3653v1)

> We conducted a preliminary field study to understand the current state of personal digital archiving in practice. Our aim is to design a service for the long-term storage, preservation, and access of digital belongings by examining how personal archiving needs intersect with existing and emerging archiving technologies, best practices, and policies. Our findings not only confirmed that experienced home computer users are creating, receiving, and finding an increasing number of digital belongings, but also that they have already lost irreplaceable digital artifacts such as photos, creative efforts, and records. Although participants reported strategies such as backup and file replication for digital safekeeping, they were seldom able to implement them consistently. Four central archiving themes emerged from the data: (1) people find it difficult to evaluate the worth of accumulated materials; (2) personal storage is highly distributed both on- and offline; (3) people are experiencing magnified curatorial problems associated with managing files in the aggregate, creating appropriate metadata, and migrating materials to maintainable formats; and (4) facilities for long-term access are not supported by the current desktop metaphor. Four environmental factors further complicate archiving in consumer settings: the pervasive influence of malware; consumer reliance on ad hoc IT providers; an accretion of minor system and registry inconsistencies; and strong consumer beliefs about the incorruptibility of digital forms, the reliability of digital technologies, and the social vulnerability of networked storage.

<summary>2007-05-16 09:22:21 - TrustMIX: Trustworthy MIX for Energy Saving in Sensor Networks</summary>

- *Olivier Powell, Luminita Moraru, Jean-Marc Seigneur*

- `0705.2313v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2313v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.2313v1)

> MIX has recently been proposed as a new sensor scheme with better energy management for data-gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks. However, it is not known how it performs when some of the sensors carry out sinkhole attacks. In this paper, we propose a variant of MIX with adjunct computational trust management to limit the impact of such sinkhole attacks. We evaluate how MIX resists sinkhole attacks with and without computational trust management. The main result of this paper is to find that MIX is very vulnerable to sinkhole attacks but that the adjunct trust management efficiently reduces the impact of such attacks while preserving the main feature of MIX: increased lifetime of the network.

<summary>2007-07-27 13:50:46 - Java Components Vulnerabilities - An Experimental Classification Targeted at the OSGi Platform</summary>

- *Pierre Parrend, Stéphane Frénot*

- `0706.3812v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3812v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.3812v3)

> The OSGi Platform finds a growing interest in two different applications domains: embedded systems, and applications servers. However, the security properties of this platform are hardly studied, which is likely to hinder its use in production systems. This is all the more important that the dynamic aspect of OSGi-based applications, that can be extended at runtime, make them vulnerable to malicious code injection. We therefore perform a systematic audit of the OSGi platform so as to build a vulnerability catalog that intends to reference OSGi Vulnerabilities originating in the Core Specification, and in behaviors related to the use of the Java language. Standard Services are not considered. To support this audit, a Semi-formal Vulnerability Pattern is defined, that enables to uniquely characterize fundamental properties for each vulnerability, to include verbose description in the pattern, to reference known security protections, and to track the implementation status of the proof-of-concept OSGi Bundles that exploit the vulnerability. Based on the analysis of the catalog, a robust OSGi Platform is built, and recommendations are made to enhance the OSGi Specifications.

<summary>2007-08-22 08:28:02 - The Fuzzy Vault for fingerprints is Vulnerable to Brute Force Attack</summary>

- *Preda Mihailescu*

- `0708.2974v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2974v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.2974v1)

> The \textit{fuzzy vault} approach is one of the best studied and well accepted ideas for binding cryptographic security into biometric authentication. The vault has been implemented in connection with fingerprint data by Uludag and Jain. We show that this instance of the vault is vulnerable to brute force attack. An interceptor of the vault data can recover both secret and template data using only generally affordable computational resources. Some possible alternatives are then discussed and it is suggested that cryptographic security may be preferable to the one - way function approach to biometric security.

<summary>2007-10-25 11:55:19 - An Improved FPGA Implementation of the Modified Hybrid Hiding Encryption Algorithm (MHHEA) for Data Communication Security</summary>

- *Hala A. Farouk, Magdy Saeb*

- `0710.4800v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.4800v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.4800v1)

> The hybrid hiding encryption algorithm, as its name implies, embraces concepts from both steganography and cryptography. In this exertion, an improved micro-architecture Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of this algorithm is presented. This design overcomes the observed limitations of a previously-designed micro-architecture. These observed limitations are: no exploitation of the possibility of parallel bit replacement, and the fact that the input plaintext was encrypted serially, which caused a dependency between the throughput and the nature of the used secret key. This dependency can be viewed by some as vulnerability in the security of the implemented micro-architecture. The proposed modified micro-architecture is constructed using five basic modules. These modules are; the message cache, the message alignment module, the key cache, the comparator, and at last the encryption module. In this work, we provide comprehensive simulation and implementation results. These are: the timing diagrams, the post-implementation timing and routing reports, and finally the floor plan. Moreover, a detailed comparison with other FPGA implementations is made available and discussed.

> Key substitution vulnerable signature schemes are signature schemes that permit an intruder, given a public verification key and a signed message, to compute a pair of signature and verification keys such that the message appears to be signed with the new signature key. A digital signature scheme is said to be vulnerable to destructive exclusive ownership property (DEO) If it is computationaly feasible for an intruder, given a public verification key and a pair of message and its valid signature relatively to the given public key, to compute a pair of signature and verification keys and a new message such that the given signature appears to be valid for the new message relatively to the new verification key. In this paper, we prove decidability of the insecurity problem of cryptographic protocols where the signature schemes employed in the concrete realisation have this two properties.
