- *Tianzuo Luo, Yuyi Zhong, Siaucheng Khoo*

- `2301.01223v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01223v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01223v1)

> Although deep learning has made remarkable progress in processing various types of data such as images, text and speech, they are known to be susceptible to adversarial perturbations: perturbations specifically designed and added to the input to make the target model produce erroneous output. Most of the existing studies on generating adversarial perturbations attempt to perturb the entire input indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose ExploreADV, a general and flexible adversarial attack system that is capable of modeling regional and imperceptible attacks, allowing users to explore various kinds of adversarial examples as needed. We adapt and combine two existing boundary attack methods, DeepFool and Brendel\&Bethge Attack, and propose a mask-constrained adversarial attack system, which generates minimal adversarial perturbations under the pixel-level constraints, namely ``mask-constraints''. We study different ways of generating such mask-constraints considering the variance and importance of the input features, and show that our adversarial attack system offers users good flexibility to focus on sub-regions of inputs, explore imperceptible perturbations and understand the vulnerability of pixels/regions to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our system to be effective based on extensive experiments and user study.

- *Xingwu Sun, Hongyin Tang, chengzhong Xu*

- `2301.00397v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00397v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00397v1)

> Neural models with an encoder-decoder framework provide a feasible solution to Question Generation (QG). However, after analyzing the model vocabulary we find that current models (both RNN-based and pre-training based) have more than 23\% inflected forms. As a result, the encoder will generate separate embeddings for the inflected forms, leading to a waste of training data and parameters. Even worse, in decoding these models are vulnerable to irrelevant noise and they suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance the performance of QG by fusing word transformation. Firstly, we identify the inflected forms of words from the input of encoder, and replace them with the root words, letting the encoder pay more attention to the repetitive root words. Secondly, we propose to adapt QG as a combination of the following actions in the encode-decoder framework: generating a question word, copying a word from the source sequence or generating a word transformation type. Such extension can greatly decrease the size of predicted words in the decoder as well as noise. We apply our approach to a typical RNN-based model and \textsc{UniLM} to get the improved versions. We conduct extensive experiments on SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets. The experimental results show that the improved versions can significantly outperform the corresponding baselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR as well as time cost.

<summary>2023-01-01 13:19:49 - Differential Evolution based Dual Adversarial Camouflage: Fooling Human Eyes and Object Detectors</summary>

- *Jialiang Sun, Tingsong Jiang, Wen Yao, Donghua Wang, Xiaoqian Chen*

- `2210.08870v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08870v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08870v3)

> Recent studies reveal that deep neural network (DNN) based object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of adding the perturbation to the images, leading to the wrong output of object detectors. Most current existing works focus on generating perturbed images, also called adversarial examples, to fool object detectors. Though the generated adversarial examples themselves can remain a certain naturalness, most of them can still be easily observed by human eyes, which limits their further application in the real world. To alleviate this problem, we propose a differential evolution based dual adversarial camouflage (DE_DAC) method, composed of two stages to fool human eyes and object detectors simultaneously. Specifically, we try to obtain the camouflage texture, which can be rendered over the surface of the object. In the first stage, we optimize the global texture to minimize the discrepancy between the rendered object and the scene images, making human eyes difficult to distinguish. In the second stage, we design three loss functions to optimize the local texture, making object detectors ineffective. In addition, we introduce the differential evolution algorithm to search for the near-optimal areas of the object to attack, improving the adversarial performance under certain attack area limitations. Besides, we also study the performance of adaptive DE_DAC, which can be adapted to the environment. Experiments show that our proposed method could obtain a good trade-off between the fooling human eyes and object detectors under multiple specific scenes and objects.

<summary>2023-01-01 16:12:43 - Trojaning semi-supervised learning model via poisoning wild images on the web</summary>

- *Le Feng, Zhenxing Qian, Sheng Li, Xinpeng Zhang*

- `2301.00435v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00435v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00435v1)

> Wild images on the web are vulnerable to backdoor (also called trojan) poisoning, causing machine learning models learned on these images to be injected with backdoors. Most previous attacks assumed that the wild images are labeled. In reality, however, most images on the web are unlabeled. Specifically, we study the effects of unlabeled backdoor images under semi-supervised learning (SSL) on widely studied deep neural networks. To be realistic, we assume that the adversary is zero-knowledge and that the semi-supervised learning model is trained from scratch. Firstly, we find the fact that backdoor poisoning always fails when poisoned unlabeled images come from different classes, which is different from poisoning the labeled images. The reason is that the SSL algorithms always strive to correct them during training. Therefore, for unlabeled images, we implement backdoor poisoning on images from the target class. Then, we propose a gradient matching strategy to craft poisoned images such that their gradients match the gradients of target images on the SSL model, which can fit poisoned images to the target class and realize backdoor injection. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first approach to backdoor poisoning on unlabeled images of trained-from-scratch SSL models. Experiments show that our poisoning achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on most SSL algorithms while bypassing modern backdoor defenses.

<summary>2023-01-01 17:02:34 - TaxIdMA: Towards a Taxonomy for Attacks related to Identities</summary>

- *Daniela PÃ¶hn und Wolfgang Hommel*

- `2301.00443v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00443v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00443v1)

> Identity management refers to the technology and policies for the identification, authentication, and authorization of users in computer networks. Identity management is therefore fundamental to today's IT ecosystem. At the same time, identity management systems, where digital identities are managed, pose an attractive target for attacks. With the heterogeneity of identity management systems, every type (i.e., models, protocols, implementations) has different requirements, typical problems, and hence attack vectors. In order to provide a systematic and categorized overview, the framework Taxonomy for Identity Management Attacks (TaxIdMA) for attacks related to identities is proposed. The purpose of this framework is to classify existing attacks associated with system identities, identity management systems, and end-user identities as well as the background using an extensible structure from a scientific perspective. The taxonomy is then evaluated with eight real-world attacks resp. vulnerabilities. This analysis shows the capability of the proposed taxonomy framework TaxIdMA in describing and categorizing these attacks.

<summary>2023-01-02 04:32:26 - Automated Repair of Programs from Large Language Models</summary>

- *Zhiyu Fan, Xiang Gao, Martin Mirchev, Abhik Roychoudhury, Shin Hwei Tan*

- `2205.10583v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10583v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10583v4)

> Large language models such as Codex, have shown the capability to produce code for many programming tasks. However, the success rate of existing models is low, especially for complex programming tasks. One of the reasons is that language models lack awareness of program semantics, resulting in incorrect programs, or even programs which do not compile. In this paper, we systematically study whether automated program repair (APR) techniques can fix the incorrect solutions produced by language models in LeetCode contests. The goal is to study whether APR techniques can enhance reliability in the code produced by large language models. Our study revealed that: (1) automatically generated code shares common programming mistakes with human-crafted solutions, indicating APR techniques may have potential to fix auto-generated code; (2) given bug location information provided by a statistical fault localization approach, the newly released Codex edit mode, which supports editing code, is similar to or better than existing Java repair tools TBar and Recoder in fixing incorrect solutions. By analyzing the experimental results generated by these tools, we provide several suggestions: (1) enhancing APR tools to surpass limitations in patch space (e.g., introducing more flexible fault localization) is desirable; (2) as large language models can derive more fix patterns by training on more data, future APR tools could shift focus from adding more fix patterns to synthesis/semantics based approaches, (3) combination of language models with APR to curate patch ingredients, is worth studying.

<summary>2023-01-02 09:59:13 - Differentiable Search of Accurate and Robust Architectures</summary>

- *Yuwei Ou, Xiangning Xie, Shangce Gao, Yanan Sun, Kay Chen Tan, Jiancheng Lv*

- `2212.14049v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14049v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14049v2)

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are found to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and various methods have been proposed for the defense. Among these methods, adversarial training has been drawing increasing attention because of its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the performance of the adversarial training is greatly limited by the architectures of target DNNs, which often makes the resulting DNNs with poor accuracy and unsatisfactory robustness. To address this problem, we propose DSARA to automatically search for the neural architectures that are accurate and robust after adversarial training. In particular, we design a novel cell-based search space specially for adversarial training, which improves the accuracy and the robustness upper bound of the searched architectures by carefully designing the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers. Then we propose a two-stage search strategy to search for both accurate and robust neural architectures. At the first stage, the architecture parameters are optimized to minimize the adversarial loss, which makes full use of the effectiveness of the adversarial training in enhancing the robustness. At the second stage, the architecture parameters are optimized to minimize both the natural loss and the adversarial loss utilizing the proposed multi-objective adversarial training method, so that the searched neural architectures are both accurate and robust. We evaluate the proposed algorithm under natural data and various adversarial attacks, which reveals the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both accurate and robust architectures. We also conclude that accurate and robust neural architectures tend to deploy very different structures near the input and the output, which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting and automatically designing of accurate and robust neural architectures.

<summary>2023-01-02 15:30:59 - Efficient Spatial Representation and Routing of Deformable One-Dimensional Objects for Manipulation</summary>

- *Azarakhsh Keipour, Maryam Bandari, Stefan Schaal*

- `2202.06172v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06172v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06172v4)

> With the field of rigid-body robotics having matured in the last fifty years, routing, planning, and manipulation of deformable objects have recently emerged as a more untouched research area in many fields ranging from surgical robotics to industrial assembly and construction. Routing approaches for deformable objects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations (e.g., Learning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in the environment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that entirely separate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the routing and manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of planning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space.   This paper proposes a novel approach to routing deformable one-dimensional objects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, sutures, threads). This approach utilizes a compact representation for the object, allowing efficient and fast online routing. The spatial representation is based on the geometrical decomposition of the space into convex subspaces, resulting in a discrete coding of the deformable object configuration as a sequence. With such a configuration, the routing problem can be solved using a fast dynamic programming sequence matching method that calculates the next routing move. The proposed method couples the routing and efficient configuration for improved planning time. Our simulation and real experiments show the method correctly computing the next manipulation action in sub-millisecond time and accomplishing various routing and manipulation tasks.

<summary>2023-01-03 01:30:28 - Five Common Misconceptions About Privacy-Preserving Internet of Things</summary>

- *Mohammad Abu Alsheikh*

- `2301.00920v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00920v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00920v1)

> Billions of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) collect sensitive data about people, creating data privacy risks and breach vulnerabilities. Accordingly, data privacy preservation is vital for sustaining the proliferation of IoT services. In particular, privacy-preserving IoT connects devices embedded with sensors and maintains the data privacy of people. However, common misconceptions exist among IoT researchers, service providers, and users about privacy-preserving IoT.   This article refutes five common misconceptions about privacy-preserving IoT concerning data sensing and innovation, regulations, and privacy safeguards. For example, IoT users have a common misconception that no data collection is permitted in data privacy regulations. On the other hand, IoT service providers often think data privacy impedes IoT sensing and innovation. Addressing these misconceptions is essential for making progress in privacy-preserving IoT. This article refutes such common misconceptions using real-world experiments and online survey research. First, the experiments indicate that data privacy should not be perceived as an impediment in IoT but as an opportunity to increase customer retention and trust. Second, privacy-preserving IoT is not exclusively a regulatory problem but also a functional necessity that must be incorporated in the early stages of any IoT design. Third, people do not trust services that lack sufficient privacy measures. Fourth, conventional data security principles do not guarantee data privacy protection, and data privacy can be exposed even if data is securely stored. Fifth, IoT decentralization does not attain absolute privacy preservation.

<summary>2023-01-03 02:09:00 - AI-Driven Confidential Computing across Edge-to-Cloud Continuum</summary>

- *SM Zobaed*

- `2301.00928v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00928v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00928v1)

> With the meteoric growth of technology, individuals and organizations are widely adopting cloud services to mitigate the burdens of maintenance. Despite its scalability and ease of use, many users who own sensitive data refrain from fully utilizing cloud services due to confidentiality concerns. Maintaining data confidentiality for data at rest and in transit has been widely explored but data remains vulnerable in the cloud while it is in use. This vulnerability is further elevated once the scope of computing spans across the edge-to-cloud continuum. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to enable data confidentiality by adopting confidential computing across the continuum. Towards this goal, one approach we explore is to separate the intelligence aspect of data processing from the pattern-matching aspect. We present our approach to make confidential data clustering on the cloud, and then develop confidential search service across edge-to-cloud for unstructured text data. Our proposed clustering solution named ClusPr, performs topic-based clustering for static and dynamic datasets that improves cluster coherency up to 30%-to-60% when compared with other encryption-based clustering techniques. Our trusted enterprise search service named SAED, provides context-aware and personalized semantic search over confidential data across the continuum. We realized that enabling confidential computing across edge-to-cloud requires major contribution from the edge tiers particularly to run multiple Deep Learning (DL) services concurrently. This raises memory contention on the edge tier. To resolve this, we develop Edge-MultiAI framework to manage Neural Network (NN) models of DL applications such that it can meet the latency constraints of the DL applications without compromising inference accuracy.

> Decompilation aims to transform a low-level program language (LPL) (eg., binary file) into its functionally-equivalent high-level program language (HPL) (e.g., C/C++). It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks.

<summary>2023-01-03 09:57:57 - Assessment of Cyber-Physical Intrusion Detection and Classification for Industrial Control Systems</summary>

> The increasing interaction of industrial control systems (ICSs) with public networks and digital devices introduces new cyber threats to power systems and other critical infrastructure. Recent cyber-physical attacks such as Stuxnet and Irongate revealed unexpected ICS vulnerabilities and a need for improved security measures. Intrusion detection systems constitute a key security technology, which typically monitors cyber network data for detecting malicious activities. However, a central characteristic of modern ICSs is the increasing interdependency of physical and cyber network processes. Thus, the integration of network and physical process data is seen as a promising approach to improve predictability in real-time intrusion detection for ICSs by accounting for physical constraints and underlying process patterns. This work systematically assesses machine learning-based cyber-physical intrusion detection and multi-class classification through a comparison to its purely network data-based counterpart and evaluation of misclassifications and detection delay. Multiple supervised detection and classification pipelines are applied on a recent cyber-physical dataset, which describes various cyber attacks and physical faults on a generic ICS. A key finding is that the integration of physical process data improves detection and classification of all considered attack types. In addition, it enables simultaneous processing of attacks and faults, paving the way for holistic cross-domain root cause identification.

<summary>2023-01-03 16:47:42 - Translating Video Recordings of Complex Mobile App UI Gestures into Replayable Scenarios</summary>

- *Carlos Bernal-CÃ¡rdenas, Nathan Cooper, Madeleine Havranek, Kevin Moran, Oscar Chaparro, Denys Poshyvanyk, Andrian Marcus*

- `2301.01191v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01191v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01191v1)

> Screen recordings of mobile applications are easy to obtain and capture a wealth of information pertinent to software developers (e.g., bugs or feature requests), making them a popular mechanism for crowdsourced app feedback. Thus, these videos are becoming a common artifact that developers must manage. In light of unique mobile development constraints, including swift release cycles and rapidly evolving platforms, automated techniques for analyzing all types of rich software artifacts provide benefit to mobile developers. Unfortunately, automatically analyzing screen recordings presents serious challenges, due to their graphical nature, compared to other types of (textual) artifacts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces V2S+, an automated approach for translating video recordings of Android app usages into replayable scenarios. V2S+ is based primarily on computer vision techniques and adapts recent solutions for object detection and image classification to detect and classify user gestures captured in a video, and convert these into a replayable test scenario. Given that V2S+ takes a computer vision-based approach, it is applicable to both hybrid and native Android applications. We performed an extensive evaluation of V2S+ involving 243 videos depicting 4,028 GUI-based actions collected from users exercising features and reproducing bugs from a collection of over 90 popular native and hybrid Android apps. Our results illustrate that V2S+ can accurately replay scenarios from screen recordings, and is capable of reproducing $\approx$ 90.2% of sequential actions recorded in native application scenarios on physical devices, and $\approx$ 83% of sequential actions recorded in hybrid application scenarios on emulators, both with low overhead. A case study with three industrial partners illustrates the potential usefulness of V2S+ from the viewpoint of developers.

- `2301.01235v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01235v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01235v1)

> One of the key tasks related to ensuring mobile app quality is the reporting, management, and resolution of bug reports. As such, researchers have committed considerable resources toward automating various tasks of the bug management process for mobile apps, such as reproduction and triaging. However, the success of these automated approaches is largely dictated by the characteristics and properties of the bug reports they operate upon. As such, understanding mobile app bug reports is imperative to drive the continued advancement of report management techniques. While prior studies have examined high-level statistics of large sets of reports, we currently lack an in-depth investigation of how the information typically reported in mobile app issue trackers relates to the specific details generally required to reproduce the underlying failures. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of 180 reproducible bug reports systematically mined from Android apps on GitHub and investigate how the information contained in the reports relates to the task of reproducing the described bugs. In our analysis, we focus on three pieces of information: the environment needed to reproduce the bug report, the steps to reproduce (S2Rs), and the observed behavior. Focusing on this information, we characterize failure types, identify the modality used to report the information, and characterize the quality of the information within the reports. We find that bugs are reported in a multi-modal fashion, the environment is not always provided, and S2Rs often contain missing or non-specific enough information. These findings carry with them important implications on automated bug reproduction techniques as well as automated bug report management approaches more generally.

<summary>2023-01-03 18:00:06 - Automated Black-box Testing of Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs</summary>

- *Davide Corradini, Michele Pasqua, Mariano Ceccato*

- `2301.01261v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01261v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01261v1)

> Mass assignment is one of the most prominent vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs. This vulnerability originates from a misconfiguration in common web frameworks, such that naming convention and automatic binding can be exploited by an attacker to craft malicious requests writing confidential resources and (massively) overriding data, that should be read-only and/or confidential. In this paper, we adopt a black-box testing perspective to automatically detect mass assignment vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs. Execution scenarios are generated purely based on the OpenAPI specification, that lists the available operations and their message format. Clustering is used to group similar operations and reveal read-only fields, the latter are candidate for mass assignment. Then, interaction sequences are automatically generated by instantiating abstract testing templates, trying to exploit the potential vulnerabilities. Finally, test cases are run, and their execution is assessed by a specific oracle, in order to reveal whether the vulnerability could be successfully exploited. The proposed novel approach has been implemented and evaluated on a set of case studies written in different programming languages. The evaluation highlights that the approach is quite effective in detecting seeded vulnerabilities, with a remarkably high accuracy.

- `2301.01321v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01321v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01321v1)

> Currently, when a security analyst discovers a vulnerability in critical software system, they must navigate a fraught dilemma: immediately disclosing the vulnerability to the public could harm the system's users; whereas disclosing the vulnerability only to the software's vendor lets the vendor disregard or deprioritize the security risk, to the detriment of unwittingly-affected users. A compelling recent line of work aims to resolve this by using Zero Knowledge (ZK) protocols that let analysts prove that they know a vulnerability in a program, without revealing the details of the vulnerability or the inputs that exploit it. In principle, this could be achieved by generic ZK techniques. In practice, ZK vulnerability proofs to date have been restricted in scope and expressibility, due to challenges related to generating proof statements that model real-world software at scale and to directly formulating violated properties. This paper presents CHEESECLOTH, a novel proofstatement compiler, which proves practical vulnerabilities in ZK by soundly-but-aggressively preprocessing programs on public inputs, selectively revealing information about executed control segments, and formalizing information leakage using a novel storage-labeling scheme. CHEESECLOTH's practicality is demonstrated by generating ZK proofs of well-known vulnerabilities in (previous versions of) critical software, including the Heartbleed information leakage in OpenSSL and a memory vulnerability in the FFmpeg graphics framework.

- `2109.06174v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06174v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06174v2)

> The digital transformation of the medical sector requires solutions that are convenient and efficient for all stakeholders while protecting patients' sensitive data. One example that has already attracted design-oriented research are medical prescriptions. However, current implementations of electronic prescription management systems typically create centralized data silos, leaving user data vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents and impeding interoperability. Research has also proposed decentralized solutions based on blockchain technology, but privacy-related challenges have often been ignored. We conduct design science research to develop and implement a system for the exchange of electronic prescriptions that builds on two blockchains and a digital wallet app. Our solution combines the bilateral, verifiable, and privacy-focused exchange of information between doctors, patients, and pharmacies through verifiable credentials with a token-based, anonymized double-spending check. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations as well as a security analysis suggest that this architecture can improve existing approaches to electronic prescription management by offering patients control over their data by design, a high level of security, sufficient performance and scalability, and interoperability with emerging digital identity management solutions for users, businesses, and institutions. We also derive principles on how to design decentralized, privacy-oriented information systems that require both the exchange of sensitive information and double-usage protection.

> We develop and study new adversarial perturbations that enable an attacker to gain control over decisions in generic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems including deep learning neural networks. In contrast to adversarial data modification, the attack mechanism we consider here involves alterations to the AI system itself. Such a stealth attack could be conducted by a mischievous, corrupt or disgruntled member of a software development team. It could also be made by those wishing to exploit a ``democratization of AI'' agenda, where network architectures and trained parameter sets are shared publicly. We develop a range of new implementable attack strategies with accompanying analysis, showing that with high probability a stealth attack can be made transparent, in the sense that system performance is unchanged on a fixed validation set which is unknown to the attacker, while evoking any desired output on a trigger input of interest. The attacker only needs to have estimates of the size of the validation set and the spread of the AI's relevant latent space. In the case of deep learning neural networks, we show that a one neuron attack is possible - a modification to the weights and bias associated with a single neuron - revealing a vulnerability arising from over-parameterization. We illustrate these concepts using state of the art architectures on two standard image data sets. Guided by the theory and computational results, we also propose strategies to guard against stealth attacks.

> Code review is a critical step in the software development life cycle, which assesses and boosts the code's effectiveness and correctness, pinpoints security issues, and raises its quality by adhering to best practices. Due to the increased need for personal data protection motivated by legislation, code reviewers need to understand where personal data is located in software systems and how it is handled. Although most recent work on code review focuses on security vulnerabilities, privacy-related techniques are not easy for code reviewers to implement, making their inclusion in the code review process challenging. In this paper, we present ongoing work on a new approach to identifying personal data processing, enabling developers and code reviewers in drafting privacy analyses and complying with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

> Grapevine budbreak is a key phenological stage of seasonal development, which serves as a signal for the onset of active growth. This is also when grape plants are most vulnerable to damage from freezing temperatures. Hence, it is important for winegrowers to anticipate the day of budbreak occurrence to protect their vineyards from late spring frost events. This work investigates deep learning for budbreak prediction using data collected for multiple grape cultivars. While some cultivars have over 30 seasons of data others have as little as 4 seasons, which can adversely impact prediction accuracy. To address this issue, we investigate multi-task learning, which combines data across all cultivars to make predictions for individual cultivars. Our main result shows that several variants of multi-task learning are all able to significantly improve prediction accuracy compared to learning for each cultivar independently.

> Least-privilege separation decomposes applications into compartments limited to accessing only what they need. When compartmentalizing existing software, many approaches neglect securing the new inter-compartment interfaces, although what used to be a function call from/to a trusted component is now potentially a targeted attack from a malicious compartment. This results in an entire class of security bugs: Compartment Interface Vulnerabilities (CIVs).   This paper provides an in-depth study of CIVs. We taxonomize these issues and show that they affect all known compartmentalization approaches. We propose ConfFuzz, an in-memory fuzzer specialized to detect CIVs at possible compartment boundaries. We apply ConfFuzz to a set of 25 popular applications and 36 possible compartment APIs, to uncover a wide data-set of 629 vulnerabilities. We systematically study these issues, and extract numerous insights on the prevalence of CIVs, their causes, impact, and the complexity to address them. We stress the critical importance of CIVs in compartmentalization approaches, demonstrating an attack to extract isolated keys in OpenSSL and uncovering a decade-old vulnerability in sudo. We show, among others, that not all interfaces are affected in the same way, that API size is uncorrelated with CIV prevalence, and that addressing interface vulnerabilities goes beyond writing simple checks. We conclude the paper with guidelines for CIV-aware compartment interface design, and appeal for more research towards systematic CIV detection and mitigation.

> With the increasing usage of open-source software (OSS) components, vulnerabilities embedded within them are propagated to a huge number of underlying applications. In practice, the timely application of security patches in downstream software is challenging. The main reason is that such patches do not explicitly indicate their security impacts in the documentation, which would be difficult to recognize for software maintainers and users. However, attackers can still identify these "secret" security patches by analyzing the source code and generate corresponding exploits to compromise not only unpatched versions of the current software, but also other similar software packages that may contain the same vulnerability due to code cloning or similar design/implementation logic. Therefore, it is critical to identify these secret security patches to enable timely fixes. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based defense system called PatchRNN to automatically identify secret security patches in OSS. Besides considering descriptive keywords in the commit message (i.e., at the text level), we leverage both syntactic and semantic features at the source-code level. To evaluate the performance of our system, we apply it on a large-scale real-world patch dataset and conduct a case study on a popular open-source web server software - NGINX. Experimental results show that the PatchRNN can successfully detect secret security patches with a low false positive rate.

> The research applies AI-driven code assistants to analyze a selection of influential computer code that has shaped modern technology, including email, internet browsing, robotics, and malicious software. The original contribution of this study was to examine half of the most significant code advances in the last 50 years and, in some cases, to provide notable improvements in clarity or performance. The AI-driven code assistant could provide insights into obfuscated code or software lacking explanatory commentary in all cases examined. We generated additional sample problems based on bug corrections and code optimizations requiring much deeper reasoning than a traditional Google search might provide. Future work focuses on adding automated documentation and code commentary and translating select large code bases into more modern versions with multiple new application programming interfaces (APIs) and chained multi-tasks. The AI-driven code assistant offers a valuable tool for software engineering, particularly in its ability to provide human-level expertise and assist in refactoring legacy code or simplifying the explanation or functionality of high-value repositories.

> Fuzzing is a security testing methodology effective in finding bugs. In a nutshell, a fuzzer sends multiple slightly malformed messages to the software under test, hoping for crashes or weird system behaviour. The methodology is relatively simple, although applications that keep internal states are challenging to fuzz. The research community has responded to this challenge by developing fuzzers tailored to stateful systems, but a clear understanding of the variety of strategies is still missing. In this paper, we present the first taxonomy of fuzzers for stateful systems and provide a systematic comparison and classification of these fuzzers.

> Mission-critical embedded software is critical to our society's infrastructure but can be subject to new security vulnerabilities as technology advances. When security issues arise, Reverse Engineers (REs) use Software Reverse Engineering (SRE) tools to analyze vulnerable binaries. However, existing tools have limited support, and REs undergo a time-consuming, costly, and error-prone process that requires experience and expertise to understand the behaviors of software and vulnerabilities. To improve these tools, we propose $\textit{cfg2vec}$, a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach. To represent binary, we propose a novel Graph-of-Graph (GoG) representation, combining the information of control-flow and function-call graphs. Our $\textit{cfg2vec}$ learns how to represent each binary function compiled from various CPU architectures, utilizing hierarchical GNN and the siamese network-based supervised learning architecture. We evaluate $\textit{cfg2vec}$'s capability of predicting function names from stripped binaries. Our results show that $\textit{cfg2vec}$ outperforms the state-of-the-art by $24.54\%$ in predicting function names and can even achieve $51.84\%$ better given more training data. Additionally, $\textit{cfg2vec}$ consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art for all CPU architectures, while the baseline requires multiple training to achieve similar performance. More importantly, our results demonstrate that our $\textit{cfg2vec}$ could tackle binaries built from unseen CPU architectures, thus indicating that our approach can generalize the learned knowledge. Lastly, we demonstrate its practicability by implementing it as a Ghidra plugin used during resolving DARPA Assured MicroPatching (AMP) challenges.

> Learning vector representations for programs is a critical step in applying deep learning techniques for program understanding tasks. Various neural network models are proposed to learn from tree-structured program representations, e.g., abstract syntax tree (AST) and concrete syntax tree (CST). However, most neural architectures either fail to capture long-range dependencies which are ubiquitous in programs, or cannot learn effective representations for syntax tree nodes, making them incapable of performing the node-level prediction tasks, e.g., bug localization. In this paper, we propose Tree-Transformer, a novel recursive tree-structured neural network to learn the vector representations for source codes. We propose a multi-head attention mechanism to model the dependency between siblings and parent-children node pairs. Moreover, we propose a bi-directional propagation strategy to allow node information passing in two directions, bottom-up and top-down along trees. In this way, Tree-Transformer can learn the information of the node features as well as the global contextual information. The extensive experimental results show that our Tree-Transformer significantly outperforms the existing tree-based and graph-based program representation learning approaches in both the tree-level and node-level prediction tasks.

> Encoder as a service is an emerging cloud service. Specifically, a service provider first pre-trains an encoder (i.e., a general-purpose feature extractor) via either supervised learning or self-supervised learning and then deploys it as a cloud service API. A client queries the cloud service API to obtain feature vectors for its training/testing inputs when training/testing its classifier (called downstream classifier). A downstream classifier is vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are testing inputs with carefully crafted perturbation that the downstream classifier misclassifies. Therefore, in safety and security critical applications, a client aims to build a robust downstream classifier and certify its robustness guarantees against adversarial examples.   What APIs should the cloud service provide, such that a client can use any certification method to certify the robustness of its downstream classifier against adversarial examples while minimizing the number of queries to the APIs? How can a service provider pre-train an encoder such that clients can build more certifiably robust downstream classifiers? We aim to answer the two questions in this work. For the first question, we show that the cloud service only needs to provide two APIs, which we carefully design, to enable a client to certify the robustness of its downstream classifier with a minimal number of queries to the APIs. For the second question, we show that an encoder pre-trained using a spectral-norm regularization term enables clients to build more robust downstream classifiers.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been increasingly deployed in various applications that involve learning on non-Euclidean data. However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to graph adversarial attacks. Although there are several defense methods to improve GNN robustness by eliminating adversarial components, they may also impair the underlying clean graph structure that contributes to GNN training. In addition, few of those defense models can scale to large graphs due to their high computational complexity and memory usage. In this paper, we propose GARNET, a scalable spectral method to boost the adversarial robustness of GNN models. GARNET first leverages weighted spectral embedding to construct a base graph, which is not only resistant to adversarial attacks but also contains critical (clean) graph structure for GNN training. Next, GARNET further refines the base graph by pruning additional uncritical edges based on probabilistic graphical model. GARNET has been evaluated on various datasets, including a large graph with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that GARNET achieves adversarial accuracy improvement and runtime speedup over state-of-the-art GNN (defense) models by up to 13.27% and 14.7x, respectively.

> As the internet penetration rate in Africa increases, so does the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Along with this growth in internet access is the risk of cyberattacks to vulnerable IoT devices mushrooming in the African cyberspace. One way to determine IoT vulnerabilities is to find open ports within Africa s cyberspace. Our research leverages Shodan search engine, a powerful tool for discovering IoT devices facing the public internet, to find open ports across Africa. We conduct an analysis of our findings, ranking countries from most to least vulnerable to cyberattack. We find that South Africa,Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria are the five countries most susceptible to cyberattack on the continent. Further, 69.8% of devices having one of the five most commonly open internet ports have had past documented vulnerabilities. Following our analysis, we conclude with policy recommendations for both the public and private sector.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are ubiquitous and span a variety of applications ranging from image classification to real-time object detection. As DNN models become more sophisticated, the computational cost of training these models becomes a burden. For this reason, outsourcing the training process has been the go-to option for many DNN users. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of vulnerability to backdoor attacks. These attacks aim to establish hidden backdoors in the DNN so that it performs well on clean samples, but outputs a particular target label when a trigger is applied to the input. Existing backdoor attacks either generate triggers in the spatial domain or naively poison frequencies in the Fourier domain. In this work, we propose a pipeline based on Fourier heatmaps to generate a spatially dynamic and invisible backdoor attack in the frequency domain. The proposed attack is extensively evaluated on various datasets and network architectures. Unlike most existing backdoor attacks, the proposed attack can achieve high attack success rates with low poisoning rates and little to no drop in performance while remaining imperceptible to the human eye. Moreover, we show that the models poisoned by our attack are resistant to various state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses, so we contribute two possible defenses that can evade the attack.

> Developing intelligent, interoperable Cyber Threat Information (CTI) sharing technologies can help build strong defences against modern cyber threats. CTIs allow the community to share information about cybercriminals' threats and vulnerabilities and countermeasures to defend themselves or detect malicious activity. A crucial need for success is that the data connected to cyber risks be understandable, organized, and of good quality. The receiving parties may grasp its content and utilize it effectively. This article describes an innovative cyber threat intelligence management platform (CTIMP) for industrial environments, one of the Cyber-pi project's significant elements. The suggested architecture, in particular, uses cyber knowledge from trusted public sources and integrates it with relevant information from the organization's supervised infrastructure in an entirely interoperable and intelligent way. When combined with an advanced visualization mechanism and user interface, the services mentioned above provide administrators with the situational awareness they require while also allowing for extended cooperation, intelligent selection of advanced coping strategies, and a set of automated self-healing rules for dealing with threats.

> Mutation testing is an established fault-based testing technique. It operates by seeding faults into the programs under test and asking developers to write tests that reveal these faults. These tests have the potential to reveal a large number of faults -- those that couple with the seeded ones -- and thus are deemed important. To this end, mutation testing should seed faults that are both "natural" in a sense easily understood by developers and strong (have high chances to reveal faults). To achieve this we propose using pre-trained generative language models (i.e. CodeBERT) that have the ability to produce developer-like code that operates similarly, but not exactly, as the target code. This means that the models have the ability to seed natural faults, thereby offering opportunities to perform mutation testing. We realise this idea by implementing $\mu$BERT, a mutation testing technique that performs mutation testing using CodeBert and empirically evaluated it using 689 faulty program versions. Our results show that the fault revelation ability of $\mu$BERT is higher than that of a state-of-the-art mutation testing (PiTest), yielding tests that have up to 17% higher fault detection potential than that of PiTest. Moreover, we observe that $\mu$BERT can complement PiTest, being able to detect 47 bugs missed by PiTest, while at the same time, PiTest can find 13 bugs missed by $\mu$BERT.

> Under adversarial attacks, time series regression and classification are vulnerable. Adversarial defense, on the other hand, can make the models more resilient. It is important to evaluate how vulnerable different time series models are to attacks and how well they recover using defense. The sensitivity to various attacks and the robustness using the defense of several time series models are investigated in this study. Experiments are run on seven-time series models with three adversarial attacks and one adversarial defense. According to the findings, all models, particularly GRU and RNN, appear to be vulnerable. LSTM and GRU also have better defense recovery. FGSM exceeds the competitors in terms of attacks. PGD attacks are more difficult to recover from than other sorts of attacks.

> Despite considerable advances in deep reinforcement learning, it has been shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to state observations. Recent efforts that have attempted to improve adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning can nevertheless tolerate only very small perturbations, and remain fragile as perturbation size increases. We propose Bootstrapped Opportunistic Adversarial Curriculum Learning (BCL), a novel flexible adversarial curriculum learning framework for robust reinforcement learning. Our framework combines two ideas: conservatively bootstrapping each curriculum phase with highest quality solutions obtained from multiple runs of the previous phase, and opportunistically skipping forward in the curriculum. In our experiments we show that the proposed BCL framework enables dramatic improvements in robustness of learned policies to adversarial perturbations. The greatest improvement is for Pong, where our framework yields robustness to perturbations of up to 25/255; in contrast, the best existing approach can only tolerate adversarial noise up to 5/255. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jlwu002/BCL.

> Empowered by deep neural networks (DNNs), Wi-Fi fingerprinting has recently achieved astonishing localization performance to facilitate many security-critical applications in wireless networks, but it is inevitably exposed to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations can mislead DNNs to wrong predictions. Such vulnerability provides new security breaches to malicious devices for hampering wireless network security, such as malfunctioning geofencing or asset management. The prior adversarial attack on localization DNNs uses additive perturbations on channel state information (CSI) measurements, which is impractical in Wi-Fi transmissions. To transcend this limitation, this paper presents FooLoc, which fools Wi-Fi CSI fingerprinting DNNs over the realistic wireless channel between the attacker and the victim access point (AP). We observe that though uplink CSIs are unknown to the attacker, the accessible downlink CSIs could be their reasonable substitutes at the same spot. We thoroughly investigate the multiplicative and repetitive properties of over-the-air perturbations and devise an efficient optimization problem to generate imperceptible yet robust adversarial perturbations. We implement FooLoc using commercial Wi-Fi APs and Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) v3 boards in offline and online experiments, respectively. The experimental results show that FooLoc achieves overall attack success rates of about 70% in targeted attacks and of above 90% in untargeted attacks with small perturbation-to-signal ratios of about -18dB.

> Inspired by the great success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in natural language processing (NLP), DNNs have been increasingly applied in source code analysis and attracted significant attention from the software engineering community. Due to its data-driven nature, a DNN model requires massive and high-quality labeled training data to achieve expert-level performance. Collecting such data is often not hard, but the labeling process is notoriously laborious. The task of DNN-based code analysis even worsens the situation because source code labeling also demands sophisticated expertise. Data augmentation has been a popular approach to supplement training data in domains such as computer vision and NLP. However, existing data augmentation approaches in code analysis adopt simple methods, such as data transformation and adversarial example generation, thus bringing limited performance superiority. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation approach MIXCODE that aims to effectively supplement valid training data, inspired by the recent advance named Mixup in computer vision. Specifically, we first utilize multiple code refactoring methods to generate transformed code that holds consistent labels with the original data. Then, we adapt the Mixup technique to mix the original code with the transformed code to augment the training data. We evaluate MIXCODE on two programming languages (Java and Python), two code tasks (problem classification and bug detection), four benchmark datasets (JAVA250, Python800, CodRep1, and Refactory), and seven model architectures (including two pre-trained models CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT). Experimental results demonstrate that MIXCODE outperforms the baseline data augmentation approach by up to 6.24% in accuracy and 26.06% in robustness.

> A learned system uses machine learning (ML) internally to improve performance. We can expect such systems to be vulnerable to some adversarial-ML attacks. Often, the learned component is shared between mutually-distrusting users or processes, much like microarchitectural resources such as caches, potentially giving rise to highly-realistic attacker models. However, compared to attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as they cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the difference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of the same system is often subtle. These factors obfuscate the de-facto risks that the incorporation of ML carries. We analyze the root causes of potentially-increased attack surface in learned systems and develop a framework for identifying vulnerabilities that stem from the use of ML. We apply our framework to a broad set of learned systems under active development. To empirically validate the many vulnerabilities surfaced by our framework, we choose 3 of them and implement and evaluate exploits against prominent learned-system instances. We show that the use of ML caused leakage of past queries in a database, enabled a poisoning attack that causes exponential memory blowup in an index structure and crashes it in seconds, and enabled index users to snoop on each others' key distributions by timing queries over their own keys. We find that adversarial ML is a universal threat against learned systems, point to open research gaps in our understanding of learned-systems security, and conclude by discussing mitigations, while noting that data leakage is inherent in systems whose learned component is shared between multiple parties.

> In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), network-wide anomaly detection is a crucial part of monitoring IoT networks due to the inherent security vulnerabilities of most IoT devices. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been proposed to separate network traffics into two disjoint subspaces corresponding to normal and malicious behaviors for anomaly detection. However, the privacy concerns and limitations of devices' computing resources compromise the practical effectiveness of PCA. We propose a federated PCA-based Grassmannian optimization framework that coordinates IoT devices to aggregate a joint profile of normal network behaviors for anomaly detection. First, we introduce a privacy-preserving federated PCA framework to simultaneously capture the profile of various IoT devices' traffic. Then, we investigate the alternating direction method of multipliers gradient-based learning on the Grassmann manifold to guarantee fast training and the absence of detecting latency using limited computational resources. Empirical results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches. Finally, we show that the Grassmann manifold algorithm is highly adapted for IoT anomaly detection, which permits drastically reducing the analysis time of the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated PCA algorithm for anomaly detection meeting the requirements of IoT networks.

> Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a dominant deep-learning paradigm for tasks where complex policies are learned within reactive systems. Unfortunately, these policies are known to be susceptible to bugs. Despite significant progress in DNN verification, there has been little work demonstrating the use of modern verification tools on real-world, DRL-controlled systems. In this case study, we attempt to begin bridging this gap, and focus on the important task of mapless robotic navigation -- a classic robotics problem, in which a robot, usually controlled by a DRL agent, needs to efficiently and safely navigate through an unknown arena towards a target. We demonstrate how modern verification engines can be used for effective model selection, i.e., selecting the best available policy for the robot in question from a pool of candidate policies. Specifically, we use verification to detect and rule out policies that may demonstrate suboptimal behavior, such as collisions and infinite loops. We also apply verification to identify models with overly conservative behavior, thus allowing users to choose superior policies, which might be better at finding shorter paths to a target. To validate our work, we conducted extensive experiments on an actual robot, and confirmed that the suboptimal policies detected by our method were indeed flawed. We also demonstrate the superiority of our verification-driven approach over state-of-the-art, gradient attacks. Our work is the first to establish the usefulness of DNN verification in identifying and filtering out suboptimal DRL policies in real-world robots, and we believe that the methods presented here are applicable to a wide range of systems that incorporate deep-learning-based agents.

> Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is vulnerable to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks and needs adequate defences before it can be used in real world applications. We have conducted a survey into the use of execution-time AML attacks against MARL and the defences against those attacks. We surveyed related work in the application of AML in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Multi-Agent Learning (MAL) to inform our analysis of AML for MARL. We propose a novel perspective to understand the manner of perpetrating an AML attack, by defining Attack Vectors. We develop two new frameworks to address a gap in current modelling frameworks, focusing on the means and tempo of an AML attack against MARL, and identify knowledge gaps and future avenues of research.

> Fairness-aware learning aims at constructing classifiers that not only make accurate predictions, but also do not discriminate against specific groups. It is a fast-growing area of machine learning with far-reaching societal impact. However, existing fair learning methods are vulnerable to accidental or malicious artifacts in the training data, which can cause them to unknowingly produce unfair classifiers. In this work we address the problem of fair learning from unreliable training data in the robust multisource setting, where the available training data comes from multiple sources, a fraction of which might not be representative of the true data distribution. We introduce FLEA, a filtering-based algorithm that identifies and suppresses those data sources that would have a negative impact on fairness or accuracy if they were used for training. As such, FLEA is not a replacement of prior fairness-aware learning methods but rather an augmentation that makes any of them robust against unreliable training data. We show the effectiveness of our approach by a diverse range of experiments on multiple datasets. Additionally, we prove formally that -- given enough data -- FLEA protects the learner against corruptions as long as the fraction of affected data sources is less than half. Our source code and documentation are available at https://github.com/ISTAustria-CVML/FLEA.

- `2301.04400v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04400v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04400v1)

> Logic locking has been a promising solution to many hardware security threats, such as intellectual property infringement and overproduction. Due to the increased attention that threats have received, many efficient specialized attacks against logic locking have been introduced over the years. However, the ability of an adversary to manipulate a locked netlist prior to mounting an attack has not been investigated thoroughly. This paper introduces a resynthesis-based strategy that utilizes the strength of a commercial electronic design automation (EDA) tool to reveal the vulnerabilities of a locked circuit. To do so, in a pre-attack step, a locked netlist is resynthesized using different synthesis parameters in a systematic way, leading to a large number of functionally equivalent but structurally different locked circuits. Then, under the oracle-less threat model, where it is assumed that the adversary only possesses the locked circuit, not the original circuit to query, a prominent attack is applied to these generated netlists collectively, from which a large number of key bits are deciphered. Nevertheless, this paper also describes how the proposed oracle-less attack can be integrated with an oracle-guided attack. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated for several benchmarks, including remarkable results for breaking a recently proposed provably secure logic locking method and deciphering values of a large number of key bits of the CSAW'19 circuits with very high accuracy.

> Prediction of dynamic environment is crucial to safe navigation of an autonomous vehicle. Urban traffic scenes are particularly challenging to forecast due to complex interactions between various dynamic agents, such as vehicles and vulnerable road users. Previous approaches have used egocentric occupancy grid maps to represent and predict dynamic environments. However, these predictions suffer from blurriness, loss of scene structure at turns, and vanishing of agents over longer prediction horizon. In this work, we propose a novel framework to make long-term predictions by representing the traffic scene in a fixed frame, referred as allo-centric occupancy grid. This allows for the static scene to remain fixed and to represent motion of the ego-vehicle on the grid like other agents'. We study the allo-centric grid prediction with different video prediction networks and validate the approach on the real-world Nuscenes dataset. The results demonstrate that the allo-centric grid representation significantly improves scene prediction, in comparison to the conventional ego-centric grid approach.

> Self-play reinforcement learning has achieved state-of-the-art, and often superhuman, performance in a variety of zero-sum games. Yet prior work has found that policies that are highly capable against regular opponents can fail catastrophically against adversarial policies: an opponent trained explicitly against the victim. Prior defenses using adversarial training were able to make the victim robust to a specific adversary, but the victim remained vulnerable to new ones. We conjecture this limitation was due to insufficient diversity of adversaries seen during training. We analyze a defense using population based training to pit the victim against a diverse set of opponents. We evaluate this defense's robustness against new adversaries in two low-dimensional environments. This defense increases robustness against adversaries, as measured by the number of attacker training timesteps to exploit the victim. Furthermore, we show that robustness is correlated with the size of the opponent population.

> Complex software systems have a network of dependencies. Developers often configure package managers (e.g., npm) to automatically update dependencies with each publication of new releases containing bug fixes and new features. When a dependency release introduces backward-incompatible changes, commonly known as breaking changes, dependent packages may not build anymore. This may indirectly impact downstream packages, but the impact of breaking changes and how dependent packages recover from these breaking changes remain unclear. To close this gap, we investigated the manifestation of breaking changes in the npm ecosystem, focusing on cases where packages' builds are impacted by breaking changes from their dependencies. We measured the extent to which breaking changes affect dependent packages. Our analyses show that around 12% of the dependent packages and 14% of their releases were impacted by a breaking change during updates of non-major releases of their dependencies. We observed that, from all of the manifesting breaking changes, 44% were introduced both in minor and patch releases, which in principle should be backward compatible. Clients recovered themselves from these breaking changes in half of the cases, most frequently by upgrading or downgrading the provider's version without changing the versioning configuration in the package manager. We expect that these results help developers understand the potential impact of such changes and recover from them.

> With the significant development of the Internet of Things and low-cost cloud services, the sensory and data processing requirements of IoT systems are continually going up. TrustZone is a hardware-protected Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for ARM processors specifically designed for IoT handheld systems. It provides memory isolation techniques to protect trusted application data from being exploited by malicious entities. In this work, we focus on identifying different vulnerabilities of the TrustZone extension of ARM Cortex-M processors. Then design and implement a threat model to execute those attacks. We have found that TrustZone is vulnerable to buffer overflow-based attacks. We have used this to create an attack called MOFlow and successfully leaked the data of another trusted app. This is done by intentionally overflowing the memory of one app to access the encrypted memory of other apps inside the secure world. We have also found that, by not validating the input parameters in the entry function, TrustZone has exposed a security weakness. We call this Achilles heel and present an attack model showing how to exploit this weakness too. Our proposed novel attacks are implemented and successfully tested on two recent ARM Cortex-M processors available on the market (M23 and M33).

> With the improvements in computing technologies, edge devices in the Internet-of-Things have become more complex. The enabler technology for these complex systems are powerful application core processors with operating system support, such as Linux. While the isolation of applications through the operating system increases the security, the interface to the kernel poses a new threat. Different attack vectors, including fault attacks and memory vulnerabilities, exploit the kernel interface to escalate privileges and take over the system.   In this work, we present SFP, a mechanism to protect the execution of system calls against software and fault attacks providing integrity to user-kernel transitions. SFP provides system call flow integrity by a two-step linking approach, which links the system call and its origin to the state of control-flow integrity. A second linking step within the kernel ensures that the right system call is executed in the kernel. Combining both linking steps ensures that only the correct system call is executed at the right location in the program and cannot be skipped. Furthermore, SFP provides dynamic CFI instrumentation and a new CFI checking policy at the edge of the kernel to verify the control-flow state of user programs before entering the kernel. We integrated SFP into FIPAC, a CFI protection scheme exploiting ARM pointer authentication. Our prototype is based on a custom LLVM-based toolchain with an instrumented runtime library combined with a custom Linux kernel to protect system calls. The evaluation of micro- and macrobenchmarks based on SPEC 2017 show an average runtime overhead of 1.9 % and 20.6 %, which is only an increase of 1.8 % over plain control-flow protection. This small impact on the performance shows the efficiency of SFP for protecting all system calls and providing integrity for the user-kernel transitions.

> Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a variety of interesting and compelling applications and emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet. Quite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for detecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static analysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false-positive rates. Another line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current fuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from the initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving around the initial state and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered by other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally, failing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess bugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) In generating function invocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between functions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function invocation sequence S1 by appending a new sequence S2, so that S2 can start fuzzing from states that are different from the initial state. (2) We incorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively towards a target branch. (3) We engage a branch search algorithm to discover rare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take care of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively evaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i) IR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches, and (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the average accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods.

> Decisions such as which movie to watch next, which song to listen to, or which product to buy online, are increasingly influenced by recommender systems and user models that incorporate information on users' past behaviours, preferences, and digitally created content. Machine learning models that enable recommendations and that are trained on user data may unintentionally leverage information on human characteristics that are considered vulnerabilities, such as depression, young age, or gambling addiction. The use of algorithmic decisions based on latent vulnerable state representations could be considered manipulative and could have a deteriorating impact on the condition of vulnerable individuals. In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of machine learning models inadvertently modelling vulnerabilities, and want to raise awareness for this issue to be considered in legislation and AI ethics. Hence, we define and describe common vulnerabilities, and illustrate cases where they are likely to play a role in algorithmic decision-making. We propose a set of requirements for methods to detect the potential for vulnerability modelling, detect whether vulnerable groups are treated differently by a model, and detect whether a model has created an internal representation of vulnerability. We conclude that explainable artificial intelligence methods may be necessary for detecting vulnerability exploitation by machine learning-based recommendation systems.

> Fuzz testing (or fuzzing) is an effective technique used to find security vulnerabilities. It consists of feeding a software under test with malformed inputs, waiting for a weird system behaviour (often a crash of the system). Over the years, different approaches have been developed, and among the most popular lies the coverage-based one. It relies on the instrumentation of the system to generate inputs able to cover as much code as possible. The success of this approach is also due to its usability as fuzzing techniques research approaches that do not require (or only partial require) human interactions. Despite the efforts, devising a fully-automated fuzzer still seems to be a challenging task. Target systems may be very complex; they may integrate cryptographic primitives, compute and verify check-sums and employ forks to enhance the system security, achieve better performances or manage different connections at the same time. This paper introduces the fork-awareness property to express the fuzzer ability to manage systems using forks. This property is leveraged to evaluate 14 of the most widely coverage-guided fuzzers and highlight how current fuzzers are ineffective against systems using forks.

> Wildfires are becoming more frequent and their effects more devastating every day. Climate change has directly and indirectly affected the occurrence of these, as well as social phenomena have increased the vulnerability of people. Consequently, and given the inevitable occurrence of these, it is important to have early warning systems that allow a timely and effective response. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and Computer Vision offer an effective and achievable alternative for opportune detection of wildfires and thus reduce the risk of disasters. YOLOv7 offers a simple, fast, and efficient algorithm for training object detection models which can be used in early detection of smoke columns in the initial stage wildfires. The developed model showed promising results, achieving a score of 0.74 in the F1 curve when the confidence level is 0.298, that is, a higher score at lower confidence levels was obtained. This means when the conditions are favorable for false positives. The metrics demonstrates the resilience and effectiveness of the model in detecting smoke columns.

In this paper, we present the first empirical study of static code analysis tools for detecting vulnerabilities in Node.js code. To conduct a comprehensive tool evaluation, we created the largest known curated dataset of Node.js code vulnerabilities. We characterized and annotated a set of 957 vulnerabilities by analyzing information contained in npm advisory reports. We tested nine different tools and found that many important vulnerabilities appearing in the OWASP Top-10 are not detected by any tool. The three best performing tools combined only detect up to 57.6% of all vulnerabilities in the dataset, but at a very low precision of 0.11%. Our curated dataset offers a new benchmark to help characterize existing Node.js code vulnerabilities and foster the development of better vulnerability detection tools for Node.js code.

> Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is an effective approach to train a deep learning model at multiple nodes over a multi-hop network, without the need of a server having direct connections to all nodes. In general, as long as nodes are connected potentially via multiple hops, the DFL process will eventually allow each node to experience the effects of models from all other nodes via either direct connections or multi-hop paths, and thus is able to train a high-fidelity model at each node. We consider an effective attack that uses jammers to prevent the model exchanges between nodes. There are two attack scenarios. First, the adversary can attack any link under a certain budget. Once attacked, two end nodes of a link cannot exchange their models. Secondly, some jammers with limited jamming ranges are deployed in the network and a jammer can only jam nodes within its jamming range. Once a directional link is attacked, the receiver node cannot receive the model from the transmitter node. We design algorithms to select links to be attacked for both scenarios. For the second scenario, we also design algorithms to deploy jammers at optimal locations so that they can attack critical nodes and achieve the highest impact on the DFL process. We evaluate these algorithms by using wireless signal classification over a large network area as the use case and identify how these attack mechanisms exploits various learning, connectivity, and sensing aspects. We show that the DFL performance can be significantly reduced by jamming attacks launched in a wireless network and characterize the attack surface as a vulnerability study before the safe deployment of DFL over wireless networks.

> The use of learning-based techniques to achieve automated software vulnerability detection has been of longstanding interest within the software security domain. These data-driven solutions are enabled by large software vulnerability datasets used for training and benchmarking. However, we observe that the quality of the data powering these solutions is currently ill-considered, hindering the reliability and value of produced outcomes. Whilst awareness of software vulnerability data preparation challenges is growing, there has been little investigation into the potential negative impacts of software vulnerability data quality. For instance, we lack confirmation that vulnerability labels are correct or consistent. Our study seeks to address such shortcomings by inspecting five inherent data quality attributes for four state-of-the-art software vulnerability datasets and the subsequent impacts that issues can have on software vulnerability prediction models. Surprisingly, we found that all the analyzed datasets exhibit some data quality problems. In particular, we found 20-71% of vulnerability labels to be inaccurate in real-world datasets, and 17-99% of data points were duplicated. We observed that these issues could cause significant impacts on downstream models, either preventing effective model training or inflating benchmark performance. We advocate for the need to overcome such challenges. Our findings will enable better consideration and assessment of software vulnerability data quality in the future.

> Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of optical character recognition (OCR) technology, enabling its adoption to a wide range of real-world applications. Despite this success, DNN-based OCR is shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which the adversary can influence the DNN model's prediction by carefully manipulating input to the model. Prior work has demonstrated the security impacts of adversarial attacks on various OCR languages. However, to date, no studies have been conducted and evaluated on an OCR system tailored specifically for the Thai language. To bridge this gap, this work presents a feasibility study of performing adversarial attacks on a specific Thai OCR application -- Thai License Plate Recognition (LPR). Moreover, we propose a new type of adversarial attack based on the \emph{semi-targeted} scenario and show that this scenario is highly realistic in LPR applications. Our experimental results show the feasibility of our attacks as they can be performed on a commodity computer desktop with over 90% attack success rate.

> Apart from the actual CPU, modern server motherboards contain other auxiliary components, for example voltage regulators for power management. Those are connected to the CPU and the separate Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) via the I2C-based PMBus.   In this paper, using the case study of the widely used Supermicro X11SSL motherboard, we show how remotely exploitable software weaknesses in the BMC (or other processors with PMBus access) can be used to access the PMBus and then perform hardware-based fault injection attacks on the main CPU. The underlying weaknesses include insecure firmware encryption and signing mechanisms, a lack of authentication for the firmware upgrade process and the IPMI KCS control interface, as well as the motherboard design (with the PMBus connected to the BMC and SMBus by default).   First, we show that undervolting through the PMBus allows breaking the integrity guarantees of SGX enclaves, bypassing Intel's countermeasures against previous undervolting attacks like Plundervolt/V0ltPwn. Second, we experimentally show that overvolting outside the specified range has the potential of permanently damaging Intel Xeon CPUs, rendering the server inoperable. We assess the impact of our findings on other server motherboards made by Supermicro and ASRock.   Our attacks, dubbed PMFault, can be carried out by a privileged software adversary and do not require physical access to the server motherboard or knowledge of the BMC login credentials.   We responsibly disclosed the issues reported in this paper to Supermicro and discuss possible countermeasures at different levels. To the best of our knowledge, the 12th generation of Supermicro motherboards, which was designed before we reported PMFault to Supermicro, is not vulnerable.

> Self-supervised models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning (ML) since they reduce the need for expensively labeled data. Because of their versatility in downstream applications, they are increasingly used as a service exposed via public APIs. At the same time, these encoder models are particularly vulnerable to model stealing attacks due to the high dimensionality of vector representations they output. Yet, encoders remain undefended: existing mitigation strategies for stealing attacks focus on supervised learning. We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses the private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership in the event of stealing. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of an encoder's output representations is higher on the victim's training data than on test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently trained. We compute this log-likelihood using density estimation models. As part of our evaluation, we also propose measuring the fidelity of stolen encoders and quantifying the effectiveness of the theft detection without involving downstream tasks; instead, we leverage mutual information and distance measurements. Our extensive empirical results in the vision domain demonstrate that dataset inference is a promising direction for defending self-supervised models against model stealing.

> Human cognitive capacities and the needs of human-centric solutions for "Industry 5.0" make humans an indispensable component in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), referred to as Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPSs), where AI-powered technologies are incorporated to assist and augment humans. The close integration between humans and technologies in Section 1.1 and cognitive attacks in Section 1.2.4 poses emerging security challenges, where attacks can exploit vulnerabilities of human cognitive processes, affect their behaviors, and ultimately damage the HCPS. Defending HCPSs against cognitive attacks requires a new security paradigm, which we refer to as "cognitive security" in Section 1.2.5. The vulnerabilities of human cognitive systems and the associated methods of exploitation distinguish cognitive security from "cognitive reliability" and give rise to a distinctive CIA triad, as shown in Sections 1.2.5.1 and 1.2.5.2, respectively. Section 1.2.5.3 introduces cognitive and technical defense methods that deter the kill chain of cognitive attacks and achieve cognitive security. System scientific perspectives in Section 1.3 offer a promising direction to address the new challenges of cognitive security by developing quantitative, modular, multi-scale, and transferable solutions.

> Thanks to rapid technological developments, new innovative solutions and practical applications of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are being created, upgrading the structures of many industrial enterprises. IIoT brings the physical and digital environment together with minimal human intervention and profoundly transforms the economy and modern business. Data flowing through IIoT feed artificial intelligence tools, which perform intelligent functions such as performance tuning of interconnected machines, error correction, and preventive maintenance. However, IIoT deployments are vulnerable to sophisticated security threats at various levels of the connectivity and communications infrastructure they incorporate. The complex and often heterogeneous nature of chaotic IIoT infrastructures means that availability, confidentiality and integrity are difficult to guarantee. This can lead to potential mistrust of network operations, concerns about privacy breaches or loss of vital personal data and sensitive information of network end-users. This paper examines the privacy requirements of an IIoT ecosystem in industry standards. Specifically, it describes the industry privacy dimensions of the protection of natural persons through the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. In addition, it presents an overview of the state-of-the-art methodologies and solutions for industrial privacy threats. Finally, it analyses the privacy requirements and suggestions for an ideal secure and private IIoT environment.

> The mass production of complex software has made it impossible to manually test it for security vulnerabilities. Automated security testing tools come in a variety of flavors, function at various stages of software development, and target different categories of software vulnerabilities. It is great that we have a plethora of automated tools to choose from, but it is a problem that their adoption and recognition are not prominent. The purpose of this study is to explore the possibilities of existing techniques while also broadening the horizon by exploring the future of security testing tools and related techniques.

- `2206.02518v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02518v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02518v2)

> Fuel ignition potential is one of the primary drivers influencing the extent of damage in wildland and wildland-urban interface fires. Determining fire and ember exposure of fuels that vary spatially and temporally will help to recognize necessary defensive actions and reduce damages. In this paper, the development of a new computational model, Temperature And Moisture Evolution predictor for complex Fuel in Open Environment (TAMEFOE), is presented. TAMEFOE predicts the diurnal temperature and moisture content evolution and vulnerability to flame ignition of objects/fuels with complex shapes or settings and materials under variable environmental conditions. The model is applicable to complex fuel scenarios (e.g., interface or intermix communities) composed of natural and manmade random-shaped objects in open atmosphere under the influence of local weather and diurnal solar radiation. The vulnerability of fuel to ember or fire ignition is determined by predicting the transient temperature and dryness of fuel in connection with the surrounding, local environment, and flame heat if any exists. In this regard, a detailed surface energy balance analysis, coupled with a water budget analysis, is performed in high spatiotemporal resolution. The model performance was validated against several existing analytical and measured data. The discrete, high-resolution surface temperature and moisture content information obtained from the model can also provide unsteady boundary conditions for computational fluid dynamics simulations when coupled physics is desired.

> The rapid escalation of applying Machine Learning (ML) in various domains has led to paying more attention to the quality of ML components. There is then a growth of techniques and tools aiming at improving the quality of ML components and integrating them into the ML-based system safely. Although most of these tools use bugs' lifecycle, there is no standard benchmark of bugs to assess their performance, compare them and discuss their advantages and weaknesses. In this study, we firstly investigate the reproducibility and verifiability of the bugs in ML-based systems and show the most important factors in each one. Then, we explore the challenges of generating a benchmark of bugs in ML-based software systems and provide a bug benchmark namely defect4ML that satisfies all criteria of standard benchmark, i.e. relevance, reproducibility, fairness, verifiability, and usability. This faultload benchmark contains 100 bugs reported by ML developers in GitHub and Stack Overflow, using two of the most popular ML frameworks: TensorFlow and Keras. defect4ML also addresses important challenges in Software Reliability Engineering of ML-based software systems, like: 1) fast changes in frameworks, by providing various bugs for different versions of frameworks, 2) code portability, by delivering similar bugs in different ML frameworks, 3) bug reproducibility, by providing fully reproducible bugs with complete information about required dependencies and data, and 4) lack of detailed information on bugs, by presenting links to the bugs' origins. defect4ML can be of interest to ML-based systems practitioners and researchers to assess their testing tools and techniques.

> Exponential growth in embedded systems is driving the research imperative to develop fuzzers to automate firmware testing to uncover software bugs and security vulnerabilities. But, employing fuzzing techniques in this context present a uniquely challenging proposition; a key problem is the need to deal with the diverse and large number of peripheral communications in an automated testing framework. Recent fuzzing approaches: i) employ re-hosting methods by executing code in an emulator because fuzzing on resource limited embedded systems is slow and unscalable; and ii) integrate models of hardware behaviour to overcome the challenges faced by the massive input-space to be explored created by peripheral devices and to generate inputs that are effective in aiding a fuzzer to make progress. Our efforts expounds upon program execution behaviours unique to firmware to address the resulting input-space search problem. The techniques we propose improve the fuzzer's ability to generate values likely to progress execution and avoids time consumed on mutating inputs that are functionally equivalent to other test cases. We demonstrate the methods are highly efficient and effective at overcoming the input-space search problem. Our emulation-based implementation, Ember-IO, when compared to the existing state-of-the-art fuzzing framework across 21 firmware binaries, demonstrates up to 255% improvement in blocks covered. Further Ember-IO discovered 6 new bugs in the real-world firmware, previously not identified by state-of-the-art fuzzing frameworks. Importantly, Ember-IO integrated with the state-of-the-art fuzzer, Fuzzware, demonstrates similar or improved coverage across all firmware binaries whilst reproducing 3 of the 6 new bugs discovered by Ember-IO.

> Neural Networks are infamously sensitive to small perturbations in their inputs, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This project evaluates the performance of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) as a purification technique to defend against adversarial attacks. This works by adding noise to an adversarial example before removing it through the reverse process of the diffusion model. We evaluate the approach on the PatchCamelyon data set for histopathologic scans of lymph node sections and find an improvement of the robust accuracy by up to 88\% of the original model's accuracy, constituting a considerable improvement over the vanilla model and our baselines. The project code is located at https://github.com/ankile/Adversarial-Diffusion.

> The major aim of this paper is to explain the data poisoning attacks using label-flipping during the training stage of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal-based human emotion evaluation systems deploying Machine Learning models from the attackers' perspective. Human emotion evaluation using EEG signals has consistently attracted a lot of research attention. The identification of human emotional states based on EEG signals is effective to detect potential internal threats caused by insider individuals. Nevertheless, EEG signal-based human emotion evaluation systems have shown several vulnerabilities to data poison attacks. The findings of the experiments demonstrate that the suggested data poison assaults are model-independently successful, although various models exhibit varying levels of resilience to the attacks. In addition, the data poison attacks on the EEG signal-based human emotion evaluation systems are explained with several Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, including Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Generated Decision Trees. And the codes of this paper are publicly available on GitHub.

> Transparent and efficient vulnerability and patch disclosure are still a challenge in the security community, essentially because of the poor-quality documentation stemming from the lack of standards. SECOM is a recently-proposed standard convention for security commit messages that enables the writing of well-structured and complete commit messages for security patches. The convention prescribes different bits of security-related information essential for a better understanding of vulnerabilities by humans and tools. SECOMlint is an automated and configurable solution to help security and maintenance teams infer compliance against the SECOM standard when submitting patches to security vulnerabilities in their source version control systems. The tool leverages the natural language processing technique Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to extract security-related information from commit messages and uses it to match the compliance standards designed. We demonstrate SECOMlint at https://youtu.be/-1hzpMN_uFI; and documentation and its source code at https://tqrg.github.io/secomlint/.

- `2006.14563v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14563v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14563v3)

> It becomes urgent to design effective anti-spoofing algorithms for vulnerable automatic speaker verification systems due to the advancement of high-quality playback devices. Current studies mainly treat anti-spoofing as a binary classification problem between bonafide and spoofed utterances, while lack of indistinguishable samples makes it difficult to train a robust spoofing detector. In this paper, we argue that for anti-spoofing, it needs more attention for indistinguishable samples over easily-classified ones in the modeling process, to make correct discrimination a top priority. Therefore, to mitigate the data discrepancy between training and inference, we propose D3M, to leverage a balanced focal loss function as the training objective to dynamically scale the loss based on the traits of the sample itself. Besides, in the experiments, we select three kinds of features that contain both magnitude-based and phase-based information to form complementary and informative features. Experimental results on the ASVspoof2019 dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods by comparison between our systems and top-performing ones. Systems trained with the balanced focal loss perform significantly better than conventional cross-entropy loss. With complementary features, our fusion system with only three kinds of features outperforms other systems containing five or more complex single models by 22.5% for min-tDCF and 7% for EER, achieving a min-tDCF and an EER of 0.0124 and 0.55% respectively. Furthermore, we present and discuss the evaluation results on real replay data apart from the simulated ASVspoof2019 data, indicating that research for anti-spoofing still has a long way to go. Source code, analysis data, and other details are publicly available at https://github.com/asvspoof/D3M.

> As part of the process of resolving issues submitted by users via bug reports, Android developers attempt to reproduce and observe the failures described by the bug report. Due to the low-quality of bug reports and the complexity of modern apps, the reproduction process is non-trivial and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic approaches that can help reproduce Android bug reports are in great need. However, current approaches to help developers automatically reproduce bug reports are only able to handle limited forms of natural language text and struggle to successfully reproduce failures for which the initial bug report had missing or imprecise steps. In this paper, we introduce a new fully automated Android bug report reproduction approach that addresses these limitations. Our approach accomplishes this by leveraging natural language process techniques to more holistically and accurately analyze the natural language in Android bug reports and designing new techniques, based on reinforcement learning, to guide the search for successful reproducing steps. We conducted an empirical evaluation of our approach on 77 real world bug reports. Our approach achieved 67% precision and 77% recall in accurately extracting reproduction steps from bug reports, and reproduced 74% of the bug reports, significantly outperforming state of the art techniques.

> In this article, we propose the Artificial Intelligence Security Taxonomy to systematize the knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities, and security controls of machine-learning-based (ML-based) systems. We first classify the damage caused by attacks against ML-based systems, define ML-specific security, and discuss its characteristics. Next, we enumerate all relevant assets and stakeholders and provide a general taxonomy for ML-specific threats. Then, we collect a wide range of security controls against ML-specific threats through an extensive review of recent literature. Finally, we classify the vulnerabilities and controls of an ML-based system in terms of each vulnerable asset in the system's entire lifecycle.

> Current interpretability methods focus on explaining a particular model's decision through present input features. Such methods do not inform the user of the sufficient conditions that alter these decisions when they are not desirable. Contrastive explanations circumvent this problem by providing explanations of the form "If the feature $X>x$, the output $Y$ would be different''. While different approaches are developed to find contrasts; these methods do not all deal with mutability and attainability constraints.   In this work, we present a novel approach to locally contrast the prediction of any classifier. Our Contrastive Entropy-based explanation method, CEnt, approximates a model locally by a decision tree to compute entropy information of different feature splits. A graph, G, is then built where contrast nodes are found through a one-to-many shortest path search. Contrastive examples are generated from the shortest path to reflect feature splits that alter model decisions while maintaining lower entropy. We perform local sampling on manifold-like distances computed by variational auto-encoders to reflect data density. CEnt is the first non-gradient-based contrastive method generating diverse counterfactuals that do not necessarily exist in the training data while satisfying immutability (ex. race) and semi-immutability (ex. age can only change in an increasing direction). Empirical evaluation on four real-world numerical datasets demonstrates the ability of CEnt in generating counterfactuals that achieve better proximity rates than existing methods without compromising latency, feasibility, and attainability. We further extend CEnt to imagery data to derive visually appealing and useful contrasts between class labels on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Finally, we show how CEnt can serve as a tool to detect vulnerabilities of textual classifiers.

> Reusing software libraries is a pillar of modern software engineering. In 2022, the average Java application depends on 40 third-party libraries. Relying on such libraries exposes a project to potential vulnerabilities and may put an application and its users at risk. Unfortunately, research on software ecosystems has shown that the number of projects that are affected by such vulnerabilities is rising. Previous investigations usually reason about dependencies on the dependency level, but we believe that this highly inflates the actual number of affected projects. In this work, we study the effect of transitivity and granularity on vulnerability propagation in the Maven ecosystem. In our research methodology, we gather a large dataset of 3M recent Maven packages. We obtain the full transitive set of dependencies for this dataset, construct whole-program call graphs, and perform reachability analysis. This approach allows us to identify Maven packages that are actually affected by using vulnerable dependencies. Our empirical results show that: (1) about 1/3 of packages in our dataset are identified as vulnerable if and only if all the transitive dependencies are considered. (2) less than 1% of packages have a reachable call path to vulnerable code in their dependencies, which is far lower than that of a naive dependency-based analysis. (3) limiting the depth of the resolved dependency tree might be a useful technique to reduce computation time for expensive fine-grained (vulnerability) analysis. We discuss the implications of our work and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to a class of attacks called "backdoor attacks", which create an association between a backdoor trigger and a target label the attacker is interested in exploiting. A backdoored DNN performs well on clean test images, yet persistently predicts an attacker-defined label for any sample in the presence of the backdoor trigger. Although backdoor attacks have been extensively studied in the image domain, there are very few works that explore such attacks in the video domain, and they tend to conclude that image backdoor attacks are less effective in the video domain. In this work, we revisit the traditional backdoor threat model and incorporate additional video-related aspects to that model. We show that poisoned-label image backdoor attacks could be extended temporally in two ways, statically and dynamically, leading to highly effective attacks in the video domain. In addition, we explore natural video backdoors to highlight the seriousness of this vulnerability in the video domain. And, for the first time, we study multi-modal (audiovisual) backdoor attacks against video action recognition models, where we show that attacking a single modality is enough for achieving a high attack success rate.

> The brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys, is an invasive insect pest of global importance that damages several crops, compromising agri-food production. Field monitoring procedures are fundamental to perform risk assessment operations, in order to promptly face crop infestations and avoid economical losses. To improve pest management, spectral cameras mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart traps or unmanned ground vehicles, could be used as an innovative technology allowing fast, efficient and real-time monitoring of insect infestations. The present study consists in a preliminary evaluation at the laboratory level of Near Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging (NIR-HSI) as a possible technology to detect BMSB specimens on different vegetal backgrounds, overcoming the problem of BMSB mimicry. Hyperspectral images of BMSB were acquired in the 980-1660 nm range, considering different vegetal backgrounds selected to mimic a real field application scene. Classification models were obtained following two different chemometric approaches. The first approach was focused on modelling spectral information and selecting relevant spectral regions for discrimination by means of sparse-based variable selection coupled with Soft Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (s-Soft PLS-DA) classification algorithm. The second approach was based on modelling spatial and spectral features contained in the hyperspectral images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Finally, to further improve BMSB detection ability, the two strategies were merged, considering only the spectral regions selected by s-Soft PLS-DA for CNN modelling.

> To cope with the ever increasing threats of dynamic and adaptive persistent attacks, Fault and Intrusion Tolerance (FIT) is being studied at the hardware level to increase critical systems resilience. Based on state-machine replication, FIT is known to be effective if replicas are compromised and fail independently. This requires different ways of diversification at the software and hardware levels. In this paper, we introduce the first hardware-based rejuvenation framework, we call Samsara, that allows for creating new computing cores (on which FIT replicas run) with diverse architectures. This is made possible by taking advantage of the programmable and reconfigurable features of MPSoC with an FPGA. A persistent attack that analyzes and exploits the vulnerability of a core will not be able to exploit it as rejuvenation to a different core architecture is made fast enough. We discuss the feasibility of this design, and we leave the empirical evaluations for future work.

> Threat intelligence on malware attacks and campaigns is increasingly being shared with other security experts for a cost or for free. Other security analysts use this intelligence to inform them of indicators of compromise, attack techniques, and preventative actions. Security analysts prepare threat analysis reports after investigating an attack, an emerging cyber threat, or a recently discovered vulnerability. Collectively known as cyber threat intelligence (CTI), the reports are typically in an unstructured format and, therefore, challenging to integrate seamlessly into existing intrusion detection systems. This paper proposes a framework that uses the aggregated CTI for analysis and defense at scale. The information is extracted and stored in a structured format using knowledge graphs such that the semantics of the threat intelligence can be preserved and shared at scale with other security analysts. Specifically, we propose the first semi-supervised open-source knowledge graph-based framework, TINKER, to capture cyber threat information and its context. Following TINKER, we generate a Cyberthreat Intelligence Knowledge Graph (CTI-KG) and demonstrate the usage using different use cases.

> Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), one of the driving tools of deep neural networks, demonstrates superior performance in prediction accuracy in various machine learning applications. However, it is unclear how it performs against adversarial attacks. Given the presence of a robust teacher, it would be interesting to investigate if NAS would produce robust neural architecture by inheriting robustness from the teacher. In this paper, we propose Robust Neural Architecture Search by Cross-Layer Knowledge Distillation (RNAS-CL), a novel NAS algorithm that improves the robustness of NAS by learning from a robust teacher through cross-layer knowledge distillation. Unlike previous knowledge distillation methods that encourage close student/teacher output only in the last layer, RNAS-CL automatically searches for the best teacher layer to supervise each student layer. Experimental result evidences the effectiveness of RNAS-CL and shows that RNAS-CL produces small and robust neural architecture.

> Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables jointly training a global model without sharing clients' data. However, its repetitive server-client communication gives room for backdoor attacks with aim to mislead the global model into a targeted misprediction when a specific trigger pattern is presented. In response to such backdoor threats on federated learning, various defense measures have been proposed. In this paper, we study whether the current defense mechanisms truly neutralize the backdoor threats from federated learning in a practical setting by proposing a new federated backdoor attack method for possible countermeasures. Different from traditional training (on triggered data) and rescaling (the malicious client model) based backdoor injection, the proposed backdoor attack framework (1) directly modifies (a small proportion of) local model weights to inject the backdoor trigger via sign flips; (2) jointly optimize the trigger pattern with the client model, thus is more persistent and stealthy for circumventing existing defenses. In a case study, we examine the strength and weaknesses of recent federated backdoor defenses from three major categories and provide suggestions to the practitioners when training federated models in practice.

> This paper proposes TRAININGCXL that can efficiently process large-scale recommendation datasets in the pool of disaggregated memory while making training fault tolerant with low overhead. To this end, i) we integrate persistent memory (PMEM) and GPU into a cache-coherent domain as Type-2. Enabling CXL allows PMEM to be directly placed in GPU's memory hierarchy, such that GPU can access PMEM without software intervention. TRAININGCXL introduces computing and checkpointing logic near the CXL controller, thereby training data and managing persistency in an active manner. Considering PMEM's vulnerability, ii) we utilize the unique characteristics of recommendation models and take the checkpointing overhead off the critical path of their training. Lastly, iii) TRAININGCXL employs an advanced checkpointing technique that relaxes the updating sequence of model parameters and embeddings across training batches. The evaluation shows that TRAININGCXL achieves 5.2x training performance improvement and 76% energy savings, compared to the modern PMEM-based recommendation systems.

> With the increasing disclosure of vulnerabilities in open-source software, software composition analysis (SCA) has been widely applied to reveal third-party libraries and the associated vulnerabilities in software projects. Beyond the revelation, SCA tools adopt various remediation strategies to fix vulnerabilities, the quality of which varies substantially. However, ineffective remediation could induce side effects, such as compilation failures, which impede acceptance by users. According to our studies, existing SCA tools could not correctly handle the concerns of users regarding the compatibility of remediated projects. To this end, we propose Compatible Remediation of Third-party libraries (CORAL) for Maven projects to fix vulnerabilities without breaking the projects. The evaluation proved that CORAL not only fixed 87.56% of vulnerabilities which outperformed other tools (best 75.32%) and achieved a 98.67% successful compilation rate and a 92.96% successful unit test rate. Furthermore, we found that 78.45% of vulnerabilities in popular Maven projects could be fixed without breaking the compilation, and the rest of the vulnerabilities (21.55%) could either be fixed by upgrades that break the compilations or even be impossible to fix by upgrading.

> To support software developers in finding and fixing software bugs, several automated program repair techniques have been introduced. Given a test suite, standard methods usually either synthesize a repair, or navigate a search space of software edits to find test-suite passing variants. Recent program repair methods are based on deep learning approaches. One of these novel methods, which is not primarily intended for automated program repair, but is still suitable for it, is ChatGPT. The bug fixing performance of ChatGPT, however, is so far unclear. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate ChatGPT on the standard bug fixing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compare the performance with the results of several other approaches reported in the literature. We find that ChatGPT's bug fixing performance is competitive to the common deep learning approaches CoCoNut and Codex and notably better than the results reported for the standard program repair approaches. In contrast to previous approaches, ChatGPT offers a dialogue system through which further information, e.g., the expected output for a certain input or an observed error message, can be entered. By providing such hints to ChatGPT, its success rate can be further increased, fixing 31 out of 40 bugs, outperforming state-of-the-art.

> Most graph neural network models rely on a particular message passing paradigm, where the idea is to iteratively propagate node representations of a graph to each node in the direct neighborhood. While very prominent, this paradigm leads to information propagation bottlenecks, as information is repeatedly compressed at intermediary node representations, which causes loss of information, making it practically impossible to gather meaningful signals from distant nodes. To address this, we propose shortest path message passing neural networks, where the node representations of a graph are propagated to each node in the shortest path neighborhoods. In this setting, nodes can directly communicate between each other even if they are not neighbors, breaking the information bottleneck and hence leading to more adequately learned representations. Our framework generalizes message passing neural networks, resulting in a class of more expressive models, including some recent state-of-the-art models. We verify the capacity of a basic model of this framework on dedicated synthetic experiments, and on real-world graph classification and regression benchmarks, and obtain state-of-the art results.

> Ethereum is a permissionless blockchain ecosystem that supports execution of smart contracts, the key enablers of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). However, the expressiveness of Ethereum smart contracts is a double-edged sword: while it enables blockchain programmability, it also introduces security vulnerabilities, i.e., the exploitable discrepancies between expected and actual behaviors of the contract code. To address these discrepancies and increase the vulnerability coverage, we propose a new smart contract security testing approach called transaction encapsulation. The core idea lies in the local execution of transactions on a fully-synchronized yet isolated Ethereum node, which creates a preview of outcomes of transaction sequences on the current state of blockchain. This approach poses a critical technical challenge -- the well-known time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) problem, i.e., the assurance that the final transactions will exhibit the same execution paths as the encapsulated test transactions. In this work, we determine the exact conditions for guaranteed execution path replicability of the tested transactions, and implement a transaction testing tool, TxT, which reveals the actual outcomes of Ethereum transactions. To ensure the correctness of testing, TxT deterministically verifies whether a given sequence of transactions ensues an identical execution path on the current state of blockchain. We analyze over 1.3 billion Ethereum transactions and determine that 96.5% of them can be verified by TxT. We further show that TxT successfully reveals the suspicious behaviors associated with 31 out of 37 vulnerabilities (83.8% coverage) in the smart contract weakness classification (SWC) registry. In comparison, the vulnerability coverage of all the existing defense approaches combined only reaches 40.5%.

> With the increase of the adoption of blockchain technology in providing decentralized solutions to various problems, smart contracts have become more popular to the point that billions of US Dollars are currently exchanged every day through such technology. Meanwhile, various vulnerabilities in smart contracts have been exploited by attackers to steal cryptocurrencies worth millions of dollars. The automatic detection of smart contract vulnerabilities therefore is an essential research problem. Existing solutions to this problem particularly rely on human experts to define features or different rules to detect vulnerabilities. However, this often causes many vulnerabilities to be ignored, and they are inefficient in detecting new vulnerabilities. In this study, to overcome such challenges, we propose a framework to automatically detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts on the blockchain. More specifically, first, we utilize novel feature vector generation techniques from bytecode of smart contract since the source code of smart contracts are rarely available in public. Next, the collected vectors are fed into our novel metric learning-based deep neural network(DNN) to get the detection result. We conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks, and the quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received extensive research attention for their promising performance in graph machine learning. Despite their extraordinary predictive accuracy, existing approaches, such as GCN and GPRGNN, are not robust in the face of homophily changes on test graphs, rendering these models vulnerable to graph structural attacks and with limited capacity in generalizing to graphs of varied homophily levels. Although many methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of GNN models, most of these techniques are restricted to the spatial domain and employ complicated defense mechanisms, such as learning new graph structures or calculating edge attentions. In this paper, we study the problem of designing simple and robust GNN models in the spectral domain. We propose EvenNet, a spectral GNN corresponding to an even-polynomial graph filter. Based on our theoretical analysis in both spatial and spectral domains, we demonstrate that EvenNet outperforms full-order models in generalizing across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, implying that ignoring odd-hop neighbors improves the robustness of GNNs. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of EvenNet. Notably, EvenNet outperforms existing defense models against structural attacks without introducing additional computational costs and maintains competitiveness in traditional node classification tasks on homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

> An abundance of datasets and availability of reliable evaluation metrics have resulted in strong progress in factoid question answering (QA). This progress, however, does not easily transfer to the task of long-form QA, where the goal is to answer questions that require in-depth explanations. The hurdles include (i) a lack of high-quality data, and (ii) the absence of a well-defined notion of the answer's quality. In this work, we address these problems by (i) releasing a novel dataset and a task that we call ASQA (Answer Summaries for Questions which are Ambiguous); and (ii) proposing a reliable metric for measuring performance on ASQA. Our task focuses on factoid questions that are ambiguous, that is, have different correct answers depending on interpretation. Answers to ambiguous questions should synthesize factual information from multiple sources into a long-form summary that resolves the ambiguity. In contrast to existing long-form QA tasks (such as ELI5), ASQA admits a clear notion of correctness: a user faced with a good summary should be able to answer different interpretations of the original ambiguous question. We use this notion of correctness to define an automated metric of performance for ASQA. Our analysis demonstrates an agreement between this metric and human judgments, and reveals a considerable gap between human performance and strong baselines.

> The Internet and cyberspace are inseparable aspects of everyone's life. Cyberspace is a concept that describes widespread, interconnected, and online digital technology. Cyberspace refers to the online world that is separate from everyday reality. Since the internet is a recent advance in human lives, there are many unknown and unpredictable aspects to it that sometimes can be catastrophic to users in financial aspects, high-tech industry, and healthcare. Cybersecurity failures are usually caused by human errors or their lack of knowledge. According to the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) X-Force Threat Intelligence Index in 2020, around 8.5 billion records were compromised in 2019 due to failures of insiders, which is an increase of more than 200 percent compared to the compromised records in 2018. In another survey performed by the Ernst and Young Global Information Security during 2018-2019, it is reported that 34% of the organizations stated that employees who are inattentive or do not have the necessary knowledge are the principal vulnerabilities of cybersecurity, and 22% of the organizations indicated that phishing is the main threat to them. Inattentive users are one of the reasons for data breaches and cyberattacks. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the United Kingdom observed that 23.2 million users who were victims of cybersecurity attacks used a carelessly selected password, which is 123456, as their account password. The Annual Cybersecurity Report published by Cisco in 2018 announced that phishing and spear phishing emails are the root causes of many cybersecurity attacks in recent years. Hence, enhancing the cybersecurity behaviors of both personal users and organizations can protect vulnerable users from cyber threats. Both human factors and technological aspects of cybersecurity should be addressed in organizations for a safer environment.

> In distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) networks, power control is crucial to optimize the spectral efficiencies of users and max-min fairness (MMF) power control is a commonly used strategy as it satisfies uniform quality-of-service to all users. The optimal solution of MMF power control requires high complexity operations and hence deep neural network based artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are proposed to decrease the complexity. Although quite accurate models can be achieved by using AI, these models have some intrinsic vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks where carefully crafted perturbations are applied to the input of the AI model. In this work, we show that threats against the target AI model which might be originated from malicious users or radio units can substantially decrease the network performance by applying a successful adversarial sample, even in the most constrained circumstances. We also demonstrate that the risk associated with these kinds of adversarial attacks is higher than the conventional attack threats. Detailed simulations reveal the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and the necessity of smart defense techniques.

> Software development teams generally welcome any effort to expose bugs in their code base. In this work, we build on the hypothesis that mobile apps from the same category (e.g., two web browser apps) may be affected by similar bugs in their evolution process. It is therefore possible to transfer the experience of one historical app to quickly find bugs in its new counterparts. This has been referred to as collaborative bug finding in the literature. Our novelty is that we guide the bug finding process by considering that existing bugs have been hinted within app reviews. Concretely, we design the BugRMSys approach to recommend bug reports for a target app by matching historical bug reports from apps in the same category with user app reviews of the target app. We experimentally show that this approach enables us to quickly expose and report dozens of bugs for targeted apps such as Brave (web browser app). BugRMSys's implementation relies on DistilBERT to produce natural language text embeddings. Our pipeline considers similarities between bug reports and app reviews to identify relevant bugs. We then focus on the app review as well as potential reproduction steps in the historical bug report (from a same-category app) to reproduce the bugs.   Overall, after applying BugRMSys to six popular apps, we were able to identify, reproduce and report 20 new bugs: among these, 9 reports have been already triaged, 6 were confirmed, and 4 have been fixed by official development teams, respectively.

> Federated learning (FL) allows participants to jointly train a machine learning model without sharing their private data with others. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks such as backdoor attacks. Consequently, a variety of defenses have recently been proposed, which have primarily utilized intermediary states of the global model (i.e., logits) or distance of the local models (i.e., L2-norm) from the global model to detect malicious backdoors. However, as these approaches directly operate on client updates, their effectiveness depends on factors such as clients' data distribution or the adversary's attack strategies. In this paper, we introduce a novel and more generic backdoor defense framework, called BayBFed, which proposes to utilize probability distributions over client updates to detect malicious updates in FL: it computes a probabilistic measure over the clients' updates to keep track of any adjustments made in the updates, and uses a novel detection algorithm that can leverage this probabilistic measure to efficiently detect and filter out malicious updates. Thus, it overcomes the shortcomings of previous approaches that arise due to the direct usage of client updates; as our probabilistic measure will include all aspects of the local client training strategies. BayBFed utilizes two Bayesian Non-Parametric extensions: (i) a Hierarchical Beta-Bernoulli process to draw a probabilistic measure given the clients' updates, and (ii) an adaptation of the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), referred by us as CRP-Jensen, which leverages this probabilistic measure to detect and filter out malicious updates. We extensively evaluate our defense approach on five benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, Reddit, IoT intrusion detection, MNIST, and FMNIST, and show that it can effectively detect and eliminate malicious updates in FL without deteriorating the benign performance of the global model.

> Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and invariant risk minimization (IRM) are two popular methods proposed to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance of machine learning models. While effective for small models, it has been observed that these methods can be vulnerable to overfitting with large overparameterized models. This work proposes a principled method, \textbf{M}odel \textbf{A}gnostic sam\textbf{PL}e r\textbf{E}weighting (\textbf{MAPLE}), to effectively address OOD problem, especially in overparameterized scenarios. Our key idea is to find an effective reweighting of the training samples so that the standard empirical risk minimization training of a large model on the weighted training data leads to superior OOD generalization performance. The overfitting issue is addressed by considering a bilevel formulation to search for the sample reweighting, in which the generalization complexity depends on the search space of sample weights instead of the model size. We present theoretical analysis in linear case to prove the insensitivity of MAPLE to model size, and empirically verify its superiority in surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/x-zho14/MAPLE}.

> Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a key technique in various security applications as it takes away the attacker's ability to perform reconnaissance for exploiting a system's vulnerabilities. However, most of the existing research in the field assumes unrealistic access to information about the attacker's motivations and/or actions when developing MTD strategies. Many of the existing approaches also assume complete knowledge regarding the vulnerabilities of a system and how each of these vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker. In this work, we aim to create algorithms that generate effective Moving Target Defense strategies that do not rely on prior knowledge about the attackers. Our work assumes that the only way the defender receives information about its own reward is via interaction with the attacker in a repeated game setting. Depending on the amount of information that can be obtained from the interactions, we devise two different algorithms using multi-armed bandit formulation to identify efficient strategies. We then evaluate our algorithms using data mined from the National Vulnerability Database to showcase that they match the performance of the state-of-the-art techniques, despite using a lot less amount of information.

> As neural networks are increasingly included as core components of safety-critical systems, developing effective testing techniques specialized for them becomes crucial. The bulk of the research has focused on testing neural-network models; but these models are defined by writing programs, and there is growing evidence that these neural-network programs often have bugs too.   This paper presents aNNoTest: an approach to generating test inputs for neural-network programs. A fundamental challenge is that the dynamically-typed languages (e.g., Python) commonly used to program neural networks cannot express detailed constraints about valid function inputs (e.g., matrices with certain dimensions). Without knowing these constraints, automated test-case generation is prone to producing invalid inputs, which trigger spurious failures and are useless for identifying real bugs. To address this problem, we introduce a simple annotation language tailored for concisely expressing valid function inputs in neural-network programs. aNNoTest takes as input an annotated program, and uses property-based testing to generate random inputs that satisfy the validity constraints. In the paper, we also outline guidelines that simplify writing aNNoTest annotations.   We evaluated aNNoTest on 19 neural-network programs from Islam et al's survey., which we manually annotated following our guidelines -- producing 6 annotations per tested function on average. aNNoTest automatically generated test inputs that revealed 94 bugs, including 63 bugs that the survey reported for these projects. These results suggest that aNNoTest can be a valuable approach to finding widespread bugs in real-world neural-network programs.

> In recent years, it has been claimed that releasing accurate statistical information on a database is likely to allow its complete reconstruction. Differential privacy has been suggested as the appropriate methodology to prevent these attacks. These claims have recently been taken very seriously by the U.S. Census Bureau and led them to adopt differential privacy for releasing U.S. Census data. This in turn has caused consternation among users of the Census data due to the lack of accuracy of the protected outputs. It has also brought legal action against the U.S. Department of Commerce. In this paper, we trace the origins of the claim that releasing information on a database automatically makes it vulnerable to being exposed by reconstruction attacks and we show that this claim is, in fact, incorrect. We also show that reconstruction can be averted by properly using traditional statistical disclosure control (SDC) techniques. We further show that the geographic level at which exact counts are released is even more relevant to protection than the actual SDC method employed. Finally, we caution against confusing reconstruction and reidentification: using the quality of reconstruction as a metric of reidentification results in exaggerated reidentification risk figures.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) and natural language processing (NLP) systems have developed rapidly and have been widely used in various real-world fields. However, they have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, the adversary injects a backdoor into the model during the training phase, so that input samples with backdoor triggers are classified as the target class. Some attacks have achieved high attack success rates on the pre-trained language models (LMs), but there have yet to be effective defense methods. In this work, we propose a defense method based on deep model mutation testing. Our main justification is that backdoor samples are much more robust than clean samples if we impose random mutations on the LMs and that backdoors are generalizable. We first confirm the effectiveness of model mutation testing in detecting backdoor samples and select the most appropriate mutation operators. We then systematically defend against three extensively studied backdoor attack levels (i.e., char-level, word-level, and sentence-level) by detecting backdoor samples. We also make the first attempt to defend against the latest style-level backdoor attacks. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets (i.e., IMDB, Yelp, and AG news) and three style transfer datasets (i.e., SST-2, Hate-speech, and AG news). The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can detect backdoor samples more efficiently and accurately than the three state-of-the-art defense approaches.

> Every attack begins with gathering information about the target. The entry point for network breaches are often vulnerabilities in internet facing websites, which often rely on an off-the-shelf Content Management System (CMS). Bot networks and human attackers alike rely on automated scanners to gather information about the CMS software installed and potential vulnerabilities. To increase the security of websites using a CMS, it is desirable to make the use of CMS scanners less reliable. The aim of this work is to extend the current knowledge about cyber deception in regard to CMS. To demonstrate this, a WordPress Plugin called 'SCANTRAP' was created, which uses simulation and dissimulation in regards to plugins, themes, versions, and users. We found that the resulting plugin is capable of obfuscating real information and to a certain extent inject false information to the output of one of the most popular WordPress scanners, WPScan, without limiting the legitimate functionality of the WordPress installation.

> Machine Learning (ML) is being used in multiple disciplines due to its powerful capability to infer relationships within data. In particular, Software Engineering (SE) is one of those disciplines in which ML has been used for multiple tasks, like software categorization, bugs prediction, and testing. In addition to the multiple ML applications, some studies have been conducted to detect and understand possible pitfalls and issues when using ML. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have focused on presenting ML best practices or guidelines for the application of ML in different domains. In addition, the practices and literature presented in previous literature (i) are domain-specific (e.g., concrete practices in biomechanics), (ii) describe few practices, or (iii) the practices lack rigorous validation and are presented in gray literature. In this paper, we present a study listing 127 ML best practices systematically mining 242 posts of 14 different Stack Exchange (STE) websites and validated by four independent ML experts. The list of practices is presented in a set of categories related to different stages of the implementation process of an ML-enabled system; for each practice, we include explanations and examples. In all the practices, the provided examples focus on SE tasks. We expect this list of practices could help practitioners to understand better the practices and use ML in a more informed way, in particular newcomers to this new area that sits at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning.

> Static analysis is a powerful tool for detecting security vulnerabilities and other programming problems. Global taint tracking, in particular, can spot vulnerabilities arising from complicated data flow across multiple functions. However, precisely identifying which flows are problematic is challenging, and sometimes depends on factors beyond the reach of pure program analysis, such as conventions and informal knowledge. For example, learning that a parameter "name" of an API function "locale" ends up in a file path is surprising and potentially problematic. In contrast, it would be completely unsurprising to find that a parameter "command" passed to an API function "execaCommand" is eventually interpreted as part of an operating-system command. This paper presents Fluffy, a bimodal taint analysis that combines static analysis, which reasons about data flow, with machine learning, which probabilistically determines which flows are potentially problematic. The key idea is to let machine learning models predict from natural language information involved in a taint flow, such as API names, whether the flow is expected or unexpected, and to inform developers only about the latter. We present a general framework and instantiate it with four learned models, which offer different trade-offs between the need to annotate training data and the accuracy of predictions. We implement Fluffy on top of the CodeQL analysis framework and apply it to 250K JavaScript projects. Evaluating on five common vulnerability types, we find that Fluffy achieves an F1 score of 0.85 or more on four of them across a variety of datasets.

> Backward compatibility of model predictions is a desired property when updating a machine learning driven application. It allows to seamlessly improve the underlying model without introducing regression bugs. In classification tasks these bugs occur in the form of negative flips. This means an instance that was correctly classified by the old model is now classified incorrectly by the updated model. This has direct negative impact on the user experience of such systems e.g. a frequently used voice assistant query is suddenly misclassified. A common reason to update the model is when new training data becomes available and needs to be incorporated. Simply retraining the model with the updated data introduces the unwanted negative flips. We study the problem of regression during data updates and propose Backward Compatible Weight Interpolation (BCWI). This method interpolates between the weights of the old and new model and we show in extensive experiments that it reduces negative flips without sacrificing the improved accuracy of the new model. BCWI is straight forward to implement and does not increase inference cost. We also explore the use of importance weighting during interpolation and averaging the weights of multiple new models in order to further reduce negative flips.

> Neural retrieval models have acquired significant effectiveness gains over the last few years compared to term-based methods. Nevertheless, those models may be brittle when faced to typos, distribution shifts or vulnerable to malicious attacks. For instance, several recent papers demonstrated that such variations severely impacted models performances, and then tried to train more resilient models. Usual approaches include synonyms replacements or typos injections -- as data-augmentation -- and the use of more robust tokenizers (characterBERT, BPE-dropout). To further complement the literature, we investigate in this paper adversarial training as another possible solution to this robustness issue. Our comparison includes the two main families of BERT-based neural retrievers, i.e. dense and sparse, with and without distillation techniques. We then demonstrate that one of the most simple adversarial training techniques -- the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) -- can improve first stage rankers robustness and effectiveness. In particular, FGSM increases models performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain distributions, and also on queries with typos, for multiple neural retrievers.

> Clueless is a binary instrumentation tool that characterises explicit cache side channel vulnerabilities of programs. It detects the transformation of data values into addresses by tracking dynamic instruction dependencies. Clueless tags data values in memory if it discovers that they are used in address calculations to further access other data.   Clueless can report on the amount of data that are used as addresses at each point during execution. It can also be specifically instructed to track certain data in memory (e.g., a password) to see if they are turned into addresses at any point during execution. It returns a trace on how the tracked data are turned into addresses, if they do.   We demonstrate Clueless on SPEC 2006 and characterise, for the first time, the amount of data values that are turned into addresses in these programs. We further demonstrate Clueless on a micro benchmark and on a case study. The case study is the different implementations of AES in OpenSSL: T-table, Vector Permutation AES (VPAES), and Intel Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (AES-NI). Clueless shows how the encryption key is transformed into addresses in the T-table implementation, while explicit cache side channel vulnerabilities are note detected in the other implementations.

> In the field of network security, with the ongoing arms race between attackers, seeking new vulnerabilities to bypass defense mechanisms and defenders reinforcing their prevention, detection and response strategies, the novel concept of cyber deception has emerged. Starting from the well-known example of honeypots, many other deception strategies have been developed such as honeytokens and moving target defense, all sharing the objective of creating uncertainty for attackers and increasing the chance for the attacker of making mistakes. In this paper a methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of honeypots and moving target defense in a network is presented. This methodology allows to quantitatively measure the effectiveness in a simulation environment, allowing to make recommendations on how many honeypots to deploy and on how quickly network addresses have to be mutated to effectively disrupt an attack in multiple network and attacker configurations. With this optimum, attacks can be detected and slowed down with a minimal resource and configuration overhead. With the provided methodology, the optimal number of honeypots to be deployed and the optimal network address mutation interval can be determined. Furthermore, this work provides guidance on how to optimally deploy and configure them with respect to the attacker model and several network parameters.

> Even though recent years have seen many attacks exposing severe vulnerabilities in Federated Learning (FL), a holistic understanding of what enables these attacks and how they can be mitigated effectively is still lacking. In this work, we demystify the inner workings of existing (targeted) attacks. We provide new insights into why these attacks are possible and why a definitive solution to FL robustness is challenging. We show that the need for ML algorithms to memorize tail data has significant implications for FL integrity. This phenomenon has largely been studied in the context of privacy; our analysis sheds light on its implications for ML integrity. We show that certain classes of severe attacks can be mitigated effectively by enforcing constraints such as norm bounds on clients' updates. We investigate how to efficiently incorporate these constraints into secure FL protocols in the single-server setting. Based on this, we propose RoFL, a new secure FL system that extends secure aggregation with privacy-preserving input validation. Specifically, RoFL can enforce constraints such as $L_2$ and $L_\infty$ bounds on high-dimensional encrypted model updates.

> Real-world deep learning models developed for Time Series Forecasting are used in several critical applications ranging from medical devices to the security domain. Many previous works have shown how deep learning models are prone to adversarial attacks and studied their vulnerabilities. However, the vulnerabilities of time series models for forecasting due to adversarial inputs are not extensively explored. While the attack on a forecasting model might aim to deteriorate the performance of the model, it is more effective, if the attack is focused on a specific impact on the model's output. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation of Directional, Amplitudinal, and Temporal targeted adversarial attacks on time series forecasting models. These targeted attacks create a specific impact on the amplitude and direction of the output prediction. We use the existing adversarial attack techniques from the computer vision domain and adapt them for time series. Additionally, we propose a modified version of the Auto Projected Gradient Descent attack for targeted attacks. We examine the impact of the proposed targeted attacks versus untargeted attacks. We use KS-Tests to statistically demonstrate the impact of the attack. Our experimental results show how targeted attacks on time series models are viable and are more powerful in terms of statistical similarity. It is, hence difficult to detect through statistical methods. We believe that this work opens a new paradigm in the time series forecasting domain and represents an important consideration for developing better defenses.

> With rise of blockchain popularity, more and more people seek to implement blockchain technology into their projects. Most common way is to take existing blockchain stack, such as Azure Blockchain Workbench or Oracle Blockchain Platform. While the blockchain technology is well-protected by its algorithms it is still vulnerable because its privacy relies on regular cryptography. And mistakes or vulnerabilities in key management protocols can affect even the most secure blockchain projects. This article considers question of vulnerabilities within Azure Blockchain Workbench key management system. We describe potential threats for each stage of key management lifecycle based on public reports and then assess how likely are those threats to realize within Azure Blockchain Workbench environment based on the technical documentation for Azure Blockchain Workbench and Azure Key Vault. Finally, we compile results of our assessment into the key management threat table with three distinct degrees of protection: fully protected, partially protected and not protected.

- `2301.11586v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11586v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11586v1)

> Software obfuscation techniques can prevent binary diffing techniques from locating vulnerable code by obfuscating the third-party code, to achieve the purpose of protecting embedded device software. With the rapid development of binary diffing techniques, they can achieve more and more accurate function matching and identification by extracting the features within the function. This makes existing software obfuscation techniques, which mainly focus on the intra-procedural code obfuscation, no longer effective.   In this paper, we propose a new inter-procedural code obfuscation mechanism Khaos, which moves the code across functions to obfuscate the function by using compilation optimizations. Two obfuscation primitives are proposed to separate and aggregate the function, which are called fission and fusion respectively. A prototype of Khaos is implemented based on the LLVM compiler and evaluated on a large number of real-world programs including SPEC CPU 2006 & 2017, CoreUtils, JavaScript engines, etc. Experimental results show that Khaos outperforms existing code obfuscations and can significantly reduce the accuracy rates of five state-of-the-art binary diffing techniques (less than 19%) with lower runtime overhead (less than 7%).

> Neural networks achieved high performance over different tasks, i.e. image identification, voice recognition and other applications. Despite their success, these models are still vulnerable regarding small perturbations, which can be used to craft the so-called adversarial examples. Different approaches have been proposed to circumvent their vulnerability, including formal verification systems, which employ a variety of techniques, including reachability, optimization and search procedures, to verify that the model satisfies some property. In this paper we propose three novel reachability algorithms for verifying deep neural networks with ReLU activations. The first and third algorithms compute an over-approximation for the reachable set, whereas the second one computes the exact reachable set. Differently from previously proposed approaches, our algorithms take as input a V-polytope. Our experiments on the ACAS Xu problem show that the Exact Polytope Network Mapping (EPNM) reachability algorithm proposed in this work surpass the state-of-the-art results from the literature, specially in relation to other reachability methods.

> Due to its simple installation and connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT) is susceptible to malware attacks. Being able to operate autonomously. As IoT devices have become more prevalent, they have become the most tempting targets for malware. Weak, guessable, or hard-coded passwords, and a lack of security measures contribute to these vulnerabilities along with insecure network connections and outdated update procedures. To understand IoT malware, current methods and analysis ,using static methods, are ineffective. The field of deep learning has made great strides in recent years due to their tremendous data mining, learning, and expression capabilities, cybersecurity has enjoyed tremendous growth in recent years. As a result, malware analysts will not have to spend as much time analyzing malware. In this paper, we propose a novel detection and analysis method that harnesses the power and simplicity of decision trees. The experiments are conducted using a real word dataset, MaleVis which is a publicly available dataset. Based on the results, we show that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in that it achieves 97.23% precision and 95.89% recall in terms of detection and classification. A specificity of 96.58%, F1-score of 96.40%, an accuracy of 96.43.

> Face recognition is known to be vulnerable to adversarial face images. Existing works craft face adversarial images by indiscriminately changing a single attribute without being aware of the intrinsic attributes of the images. To this end, we propose a new Semantic Adversarial Attack called SAA-StarGAN that tampers with the significant facial attributes for each image. We predict the most significant attributes by applying the cosine similarity or probability score. The probability score method is based on training a Face Verification model for an attribute prediction task to obtain a class probability score for each attribute. The prediction process will help craft adversarial face images more easily and efficiently, as well as improve the adversarial transferability. Then, we change the most significant facial attributes, with either one or more of the facial attributes for impersonation and dodging attacks in white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results show that our method could generate diverse and realistic adversarial face images meanwhile avoid affecting human perception of the face recognition. SAA-StarGAN achieves an 80.5% attack success rate against black-box models, outperforming existing methods by 35.5% under the impersonation attack. Concerning the black-box setting, SAA-StarGAN achieves high attack success rates on various models. The experiments confirm that predicting the most important attributes significantly affects the success of adversarial attacks in both white-box and black-box settings and could enhance the transferability of the crafted adversarial examples.

> WebAssembly (abbreviated WASM) has emerged as a promising language of the Web and also been used for a wide spectrum of software applications such as mobile applications and desktop applications. These applications, named as WASM applications, commonly run in WASM runtimes. Bugs in WASM runtimes are frequently reported by developers and cause the crash of WASM applications. However, these bugs have not been well studied. To fill in the knowledge gap, we present a systematic study to characterize and detect bugs in WASM runtimes. We first harvest a dataset of 311 real-world bugs from hundreds of related posts on GitHub. Based on the collected high-quality bug reports, we distill 31 bug categories of WASM runtimes and summarize their common fix strategies. Furthermore, we develop a pattern-based bug detection framework to automatically detect bugs in WASM runtimes. We apply the detection framework to five popular WASM runtimes and successfully uncover 53 bugs that have never been reported previously, among which 14 have been confirmed and 6 have been fixed by runtime developers.

> Recent advancements in 3D-printing/additive manufacturing has brought forth a new interest in the use of Controller Area Network (CAN) for multi-module, plug-and-play bus support for their embedded systems. CAN systems provide a variety of benefits that can outweigh typical conventional wire-loom protocols in many categories. However, implementation of CAN also brings forth vulnerabilities provided by its spoofable, destination-encoded shared communication bus. These vulnerabilities result in undetectable fault injection, packet manipulation, unauthorized packet logging/sniffing, and more. They also provide attackers the capability to manipulate all sensor information, commands, and create unsafe operating conditions using only a single compromised node on the CAN network (bypassing all root-of-trust in the modules). Thus, malicious hardware requires only a connection to the bus for access to all traffic. In this paper, we discuss the effects of repurposed CAN-based attacks capable of manipulating sensor data, overriding systems, and injecting dangerous commands on the Controller Area Network using various entry methods. As a case study, we also showed a spoofing attack on critical data modules within a commercial 3D printer.

> Neural text-to-SQL models have achieved remarkable performance in translating natural language questions into SQL queries. However, recent studies reveal that text-to-SQL models are vulnerable to task-specific perturbations. Previous curated robustness test sets usually focus on individual phenomena. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive robustness benchmark based on Spider, a cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark, to diagnose the model robustness. We design 17 perturbations on databases, natural language questions, and SQL queries to measure the robustness from different angles. In order to collect more diversified natural question perturbations, we utilize large pretrained language models (PLMs) to simulate human behaviors in creating natural questions. We conduct a diagnostic study of the state-of-the-art models on the robustness set. Experimental results reveal that even the most robust model suffers from a 14.0% performance drop overall and a 50.7% performance drop on the most challenging perturbation. We also present a breakdown analysis regarding text-to-SQL model designs and provide insights for improving model robustness.

> Existing algorithms for ensuring fairness in AI use a single-shot training strategy, where an AI model is trained on an annotated training dataset with sensitive attributes and then fielded for utilization. This training strategy is effective in problems with stationary distributions, where both training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, it is vulnerable with respect to distributional shifts in the input space that may occur after the initial training phase. As a result, the time-dependent nature of data can introduce biases into the model predictions. Model retraining from scratch using a new annotated dataset is a naive solution that is expensive and time-consuming. We develop an algorithm to adapt a fair model to remain fair under domain shift using solely new unannotated data points. We recast this learning setting as an unsupervised domain adaptation problem. Our algorithm is based on updating the model such that the internal representation of data remains unbiased despite distributional shifts in the input space. We provide extensive empirical validation on three widely employed fairness datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

> Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on a collection of tasks described via instructions, a.k.a. instruction-tuning, improves their zero and few-shot generalization to unseen tasks. However, there is a limited understanding of the performance trade-offs of different decisions made during the instruction-tuning process. These decisions include the scale and diversity of the instruction-tuning benchmark, different task sampling strategies, fine-tuning with and without demonstrations, training using specialized datasets for reasoning and dialogue, and finally, the fine-tuning objectives themselves. In this paper, we characterize the effect of instruction-tuning decisions on downstream task performance when scaling both model and benchmark sizes. To this end, we create OPT-IML Bench: a large benchmark for Instruction Meta-Learning (IML) of 2000 NLP tasks consolidated into task categories from 8 existing benchmarks, and prepare an evaluation framework to measure three types of model generalizations: to tasks from fully held-out categories, to held-out tasks from seen categories, and to held-out instances from seen tasks. Through the lens of this framework, we first present insights about instruction-tuning decisions as applied to OPT-30B and further exploit these insights to train OPT-IML 30B and 175B, which are instruction-tuned versions of OPT. OPT-IML demonstrates all three generalization abilities at both scales on four different evaluation benchmarks with diverse tasks and input formats -- PromptSource, FLAN, Super-NaturalInstructions, and UnifiedSKG. Not only does it significantly outperform OPT on all benchmarks but is also highly competitive with existing models fine-tuned on each specific benchmark. We release OPT-IML at both scales, together with the OPT-IML Bench evaluation framework.

> Stochastic linear contextual bandit algorithms have substantial applications in practice, such as recommender systems, online advertising, clinical trials, etc. Recent works show that optimal bandit algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and can fail completely in the presence of attacks. Existing robust bandit algorithms only work for the non-contextual setting under the attack of rewards and cannot improve the robustness in the general and popular contextual bandit environment. In addition, none of the existing methods can defend against attacked context. In this work, we provide the first robust bandit algorithm for stochastic linear contextual bandit setting under a fully adaptive and omniscient attack with sub-linear regret. Our algorithm not only works under the attack of rewards, but also under attacked context. Moreover, it does not need any information about the attack budget or the particular form of the attack. We provide theoretical guarantees for our proposed algorithm and show by experiments that our proposed algorithm improves the robustness against various kinds of popular attacks.

> Globalization in the semiconductor industry enables fabless design houses to reduce their costs, save time, and make use of newer technologies. However, the offshoring of Integrated Circuit (IC) fabrication has negative sides, including threats such as Hardware Trojans (HTs) - a type of malicious logic that is not trivial to detect. One aspect of IC design that is not affected by globalization is the need for thorough verification. Verification engineers devise complex assets to make sure designs are bug-free, including assertions. This knowledge is typically not reused once verification is over. The premise of this paper is that verification assets that already exist can be turned into effective security checkers for HT detection. For this purpose, we show how assertions can be used as online monitors. To this end, we propose a security metric and an assertion selection flow that leverages Cadence JasperGold Security Path Verification (SPV). The experimental results show that our approach scales for industry-size circuits by analyzing more than 100 assertions for different Intellectual Properties (IPs) of the OpenTitan System-on-Chip (SoC). Moreover, our detection solution is pragmatic since it does not rely on the HT activation mechanism.

> Cyber security risk assessments provide a pivotal starting point towards the understanding of existing risk exposure, through which suitable mitigation strategies can be formed. Where risk is viewed as a product of threat, vulnerability, and impact, understanding each element is of equal importance. This can be a challenge in Industrial Control System (ICS) environments, where adopted technologies are typically not only bespoke, but interact directly with the physical world. To date, existing vulnerability identification has focused on traditional vulnerability categories. While this provides risk assessors with a baseline understanding, and the ability to hypothesize on potential resulting impacts, it is high level, operating at a level of abstraction that would be viewed as incomplete within a traditional information system context. The work presented in this paper takes the understanding of ICS device vulnerabilities one step further. It offers a tool, PLC-VBS, that helps identify Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) vulnerabilities, specifically within logic used to monitor, control, and automate operational processes. PLC-VBS gives risk assessors a more coherent picture about the potential impact should the identified vulnerabilities be exploited; this applies specifically to operational process elements.

> Recent deep learning (DL) applications are mostly built on top of DL libraries. The quality assurance of these libraries is critical to the dependable deployment of DL applications. Techniques have been proposed to generate various DL models and apply them to test these libraries. However, their test effectiveness is constrained by the diversity of layer API calls in their generated DL models. Our study reveals that these techniques can cover at most 34.1% layer inputs, 25.9% layer parameter values, and 15.6% layer sequences. As a result, we find that many bugs arising from specific layer API calls (i.e., specific layer inputs, parameter values, or layer sequences) can be missed by existing techniques. Because of this limitation, we propose COMET to effectively generate DL models with diverse layer API calls for DL library testing. COMET: (1) designs a set of mutation operators and a coverage-based search algorithm to diversify layer inputs, layer parameter values, and layer sequences in DL models. (2) proposes a model synthesis method to boost the test efficiency without compromising the layer API call diversity. Our evaluation result shows that COMET outperforms baselines by covering twice as many layer inputs (69.7% vs. 34.1%), layer parameter values (50.2% vs. 25.9%), and layer sequences (39.0% vs. 15.6%) as those by the state-of-the-art. Moreover, COMET covers 3.4% more library branches than those by existing techniques. Finally, COMET detects 32 new bugs in the latest version of eight popular DL libraries, including TensorFlow and MXNet, with 21 of them confirmed by DL library developers and 7 of those confirmed bugs have been fixed by developers.

- `2301.12968v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12968v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12968v1)

> Deep neural networks are widely known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, especially showing significantly poor performance on adversarial examples generated under the white-box setting. However, most white-box attack methods rely heavily on the target model and quickly get stuck in local optima, resulting in poor adversarial transferability. The momentum-based methods and their variants are proposed to escape the local optima for better transferability. In this work, we notice that the transferability of adversarial examples generated by the iterative fast gradient sign method (I-FGSM) exhibits a decreasing trend when increasing the number of iterations. Motivated by this finding, we argue that the information of adversarial perturbations near the benign sample, especially the direction, benefits more on the transferability. Thus, we propose a novel strategy, which uses the Scheduled step size and the Dual example (SD), to fully utilize the adversarial information near the benign sample. Our proposed strategy can be easily integrated with existing adversarial attack methods for better adversarial transferability. Empirical evaluations on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance the transferability of existing adversarial attacks.

> 3D vision with real-time LiDAR-based point cloud data became a vital part of autonomous system research, especially perception and prediction modules use for object classification, segmentation, and detection. Despite their success, point cloud-based network models are vulnerable to multiple adversarial attacks, where the certain factor of changes in the validation set causes significant performance drop in well-trained networks. Most of the existing verifiers work perfectly on 2D convolution. Due to complex architecture, dimension of hyper-parameter, and 3D convolution, no verifiers can perform the basic layer-wise verification. It is difficult to conclude the robustness of a 3D vision model without performing the verification. Because there will be always corner cases and adversarial input that can compromise the model's effectiveness.   In this project, we describe a point cloud-based network verifier that successfully deals state of the art 3D classifier PointNet verifies the robustness by generating adversarial inputs. We have used extracted properties from the trained PointNet and changed certain factors for perturbation input. We calculate the impact on model accuracy versus property factor and can test PointNet network's robustness against a small collection of perturbing input states resulting from adversarial attacks like the suggested hybrid reverse signed attack. The experimental results reveal that the resilience property of PointNet is affected by our hybrid reverse signed perturbation strategy

> Image diffusion models such as DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion have attracted significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality synthetic images. In this work, we show that diffusion models memorize individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time. With a generate-and-filter pipeline, we extract over a thousand training examples from state-of-the-art models, ranging from photographs of individual people to trademarked company logos. We also train hundreds of diffusion models in various settings to analyze how different modeling and data decisions affect privacy. Overall, our results show that diffusion models are much less private than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training.

> Automated Program Repair (APR) can help developers automatically generate patches for bugs. Due to the impressive performance obtained using Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs) on many code related tasks, researchers have started to directly use LLMs for APR. However, prior approaches simply repeatedly sample the LLM given the same constructed input/prompt created from the original buggy code, which not only leads to generating the same incorrect patches repeatedly but also miss the critical information in testcases. To address these limitations, we propose conversational APR, a new paradigm for program repair that alternates between patch generation and validation in a conversational manner. In conversational APR, we iteratively build the input to the model by combining previously generated patches with validation feedback. As such, we leverage the long-term context window of LLMs to not only avoid generating previously incorrect patches but also incorporate validation feedback to help the model understand the semantic meaning of the program under test. We evaluate 10 different LLM including the newly developed ChatGPT model to demonstrate the improvement of conversational APR over the prior LLM for APR approach.

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) are becoming a very popular paradigm for vision tasks as they achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification. However, although early works implied that this network structure had increased robustness against adversarial attacks, some works argue ViTs are still vulnerable. This paper presents our first attempt toward detecting adversarial attacks during inference time using the network's input and outputs as well as latent features. We design four quantifications (or derivatives) of input, output, and latent vectors of ViT-based models that provide a signature of the inference, which could be beneficial for the attack detection, and empirically study their behavior over clean samples and adversarial samples. The results demonstrate that the quantifications from input (images) and output (posterior probabilities) are promising for distinguishing clean and adversarial samples, while latent vectors offer less discriminative power, though they give some insights on how adversarial perturbations work.

> The adversarial vulnerability of neural nets, and subsequent techniques to create robust models have attracted significant attention; yet we still lack a full understanding of this phenomenon. Here, we study adversarial examples of trained neural networks through analytical tools afforded by recent theory advances connecting neural networks and kernel methods, namely the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), following a growing body of work that leverages the NTK approximation to successfully analyze important deep learning phenomena and design algorithms for new applications. We show how NTKs allow to generate adversarial examples in a ``training-free'' fashion, and demonstrate that they transfer to fool their finite-width neural net counterparts in the ``lazy'' regime. We leverage this connection to provide an alternative view on robust and non-robust features, which have been suggested to underlie the adversarial brittleness of neural nets. Specifically, we define and study features induced by the eigendecomposition of the kernel to better understand the role of robust and non-robust features, the reliance on both for standard classification and the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We find that such features are surprisingly consistent across architectures, and that robust features tend to correspond to the largest eigenvalues of the model, and thus are learned early during training. Our framework allows us to identify and visualize non-robust yet useful features. Finally, we shed light on the robustness mechanism underlying adversarial training of neural nets used in practice: quantifying the evolution of the associated empirical NTK, we demonstrate that its dynamics falls much earlier into the ``lazy'' regime and manifests a much stronger form of the well known bias to prioritize learning features within the top eigenspaces of the kernel, compared to standard training.

> Millions of vulnerable consumer IoT devices in home networks are the enabler for cyber crimes putting user privacy and Internet security at risk. Internet service providers (ISPs) are best poised to play key roles in mitigating risks by automatically inferring active IoT devices per household and notifying users of vulnerable ones. Developing a scalable inference method that can perform robustly across thousands of home networks is a non-trivial task. This paper focuses on the challenges of developing and applying data-driven inference models when labeled data of device behaviors is limited and the distribution of data changes (concept drift) across time and space domains. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We collect and analyze network traffic of 24 types of consumer IoT devices from 12 real homes over six weeks to highlight the challenge of temporal and spatial concept drifts in network behavior of IoT devices; (2) We analyze the performance of two inference strategies, namely "global inference" (a model trained on a combined set of all labeled data from training homes) and "contextualized inference" (several models each trained on the labeled data from a training home) in the presence of concept drifts; and (3) To manage concept drifts, we develop a method that dynamically applies the ``closest'' model (from a set) to network traffic of unseen homes during the testing phase, yielding better performance in 20% of scenarios.

> Neural networks (NNs) are known to be vulnerable against adversarial perturbations, and thus there is a line of work aiming to provide robustness certification for NNs, such as randomized smoothing, which samples smoothing noises from a certain distribution to certify the robustness for a smoothed classifier. However, as shown by previous work, the certified robust radius in randomized smoothing suffers from scaling to large datasets ("curse of dimensionality"). To overcome this hurdle, we propose a Double Sampling Randomized Smoothing (DSRS) framework, which exploits the sampled probability from an additional smoothing distribution to tighten the robustness certification of the previous smoothed classifier. Theoretically, under mild assumptions, we prove that DSRS can certify $\Theta(\sqrt d)$ robust radius under $\ell_2$ norm where $d$ is the input dimension, implying that DSRS may be able to break the curse of dimensionality of randomized smoothing. We instantiate DSRS for a generalized family of Gaussian smoothing and propose an efficient and sound computing method based on customized dual optimization considering sampling error. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet verify our theory and show that DSRS certifies larger robust radii than existing baselines consistently under different settings. Code is available at https://github.com/llylly/DSRS.

> Port scanning is the process of attempting to connect to various network ports on a computing endpoint to determine which ports are open and which services are running on them. It is a common method used by hackers to identify vulnerabilities in a network or system. By determining which ports are open, an attacker can identify which services and applications are running on a device and potentially exploit any known vulnerabilities in those services. Consequently, it is important to detect port scanning because it is often the first step in a cyber attack. By identifying port scanning attempts, cybersecurity professionals can take proactive measures to protect the systems and networks before an attacker has a chance to exploit any vulnerabilities. Against this background, researchers have worked for over a decade to develop robust methods to detect port scanning. While there have been various surveys, none have focused solely on machine learning based detection schemes specific to port scans. Accordingly, we provide a systematic review of 15 papers published between February 2021 and January 2023. We extract critical information such as training dataset, algorithm used, technique, and model accuracy. We also collect unresolved challenges and ideas for future work. The outcomes are significant for researchers looking to step off from the latest work and for practitioners interested in novel mechanisms to detect the early stages of cyber attack.

> Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are a kind of infection caused through the transmission of vectors generated by the bites of infected parasites, bacteria, and viruses, such as ticks, mosquitoes, triatomine bugs, blackflies, and sandflies. If these diseases are not properly treated within a reasonable time frame, the mortality rate may rise. In this work, we propose a set of ontologies that will help in the diagnosis and treatment of vector-borne diseases. For developing VBD's ontology, electronic health records taken from the Indian Health Records website, text data generated from Indian government medical mobile applications, and doctors' prescribed handwritten notes of patients are used as input. This data is then converted into correct text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and a spelling checker after pre-processing. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is applied for entity extraction from text data for making Resource Description Framework (RDF) medical data with the help of the Patient Clinical Data (PCD) ontology. Afterwards, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) guidelines, and RDF medical data are used to develop ontologies for VBDs, and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules are applied for diagnosis and treatment. The developed ontology helps in the construction of decision support systems (DSS) for the NVBDCP to control these diseases.

> The cryptocurrency Ethereum is the most widely used execution platform for smart contracts. Smart contracts are distributed applications, which govern financial assets and, hence, can implement advanced financial instruments, such as decentralized exchanges or autonomous organizations (DAOs). Their financial nature makes smart contracts an attractive attack target, as demonstrated by numerous exploits on popular contracts resulting in financial damage of millions of dollars. This omnipresent attack hazard motivates the need for sound static analysis tools, which assist smart contract developers in eliminating contract vulnerabilities a priori to deployment. Vulnerability assessment that is sound and insightful for EVM contracts is a formidable challenge because contracts execute low-level bytecode in a largely unknown and potentially hostile execution environment. So far, there exists no provably sound automated analyzer that allows for the verification of security properties based on program dependencies, even though prevalent attack classes fall into this category. In this work, we present HoRStify, the first automated analyzer for dependency properties of Ethereum smart contracts based on sound static analysis. HoRStify grounds its soundness proof on a formal proof framework for static program slicing that we instantiate to the semantics of EVM bytecode. We demonstrate that HoRStify is flexible enough to soundly verify the absence of famous attack classes such as timestamp dependency and, at the same time, performant enough to analyze real-world smart contracts.

> Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks (BNs) are a family of probabilistic graphical models which express rich statistical dependencies in binary data. Variational inference (VI) has been the main method proposed to learn noisy-OR BNs with complex latent structures (Jaakkola & Jordan, 1999; Ji et al., 2020; Buhai et al., 2020). However, the proposed VI approaches either (a) use a recognition network with standard amortized inference that cannot induce ``explaining-away''; or (b) assume a simple mean-field (MF) posterior which is vulnerable to bad local optima. Existing MF VI methods also update the MF parameters sequentially which makes them inherently slow. In this paper, we propose parallel max-product as an alternative algorithm for learning noisy-OR BNs with complex latent structures and we derive a fast stochastic training scheme that scales to large datasets. We evaluate both approaches on several benchmarks where VI is the state-of-the-art and show that our method (a) achieves better test performance than Ji et al. (2020) for learning noisy-OR BNs with hierarchical latent structures on large sparse real datasets; (b) recovers a higher number of ground truth parameters than Buhai et al. (2020) from cluttered synthetic scenes; and (c) solves the 2D blind deconvolution problem from Lazaro-Gredilla et al. (2021) and variant - including binary matrix factorization - while VI catastrophically fails and is up to two orders of magnitude slower.

> Web services commonly employ Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) for performance and security. As web traffic is becoming 100% HTTPS, more and more websites allow CDNs to terminate their HTTPS connections. This practice may expose a website's user sensitive information such as a user's login password to a third-party CDN. In this paper, we measure and quantify the extent of user password exposure to third-party CDNs. We find that among Alexa top 50K websites, at least 12,451 of them use CDNs and contain user login entrances. Among those websites, 33% of them expose users' passwords to the CDNs, and a popular CDN may observe passwords from more than 40% of its customers. This result suggests that if a CDN infrastructure has a vulnerability or an insider attack, many users' accounts will be at risk. If we assume the attacker is a passive eavesdropper, a website can avoid this vulnerability by encrypting users' passwords in HTTPS connections. Our measurement shows that less than 17% of the websites adopt this countermeasure.

> The evil twin attack is a major security threat to WLANs. An evil twin is a rogue AP installed by a malicious user to impersonate legitimate APs. It intends to attract victims in order to intercept their credentials, to steal their sensitive information, to eavesdrop on their data, etc. In this paper, we study the security mechanisms of wireless networks and we introduce the different authentication methods, including 802.1X authentication. We show that 802.1X has improved security through the use of digital certificates but does not define any practical technique for the user to check the network certificate. Therefore, it remains vulnerable to the evil twin attack. To repair this vulnerability, we introduce Robust Certificate Management System (RCMS) which takes advantage of the digital certificates of 802.1X to protect the users against rogue APs. RCMS defines a new verification code to allow the user device to check the network certificate. This practical verification combined with the reliability of digital certificates provides a perfect protection against rogue APs. RCMS requires a small software update on the user terminal and does not need any modification of IEEE 802.11. It has a significant flexibility since trusting a single AP is enough to trust all the APs of the extended network. This allows the administrators to extend their networks easily without the need to update any database of trusted APs on the user devices.

> In spite of intense research efforts, deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples: an input that forces the network to confidently produce incorrect outputs. Adversarial examples are typically generated by an attack algorithm that optimizes a perturbation added to a benign input. Many such algorithms have been developed. If it were possible to reverse engineer attack algorithms from adversarial examples, this could deter bad actors because of the possibility of attribution. Here we formulate reverse engineering as a supervised learning problem where the goal is to assign an adversarial example to a class that represents the algorithm and parameters used. To our knowledge it has not been previously shown whether this is even possible. We first test whether we can classify the perturbations added to images by attacks on undefended single-label image classification models. Taking a "fight fire with fire" approach, we leverage the sensitivity of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, training them to classify these perturbations. On a 17-class dataset (5 attacks, 4 bounded with 4 epsilon values each), we achieve an accuracy of 99.4% with a ResNet50 model trained on the perturbations. We then ask whether we can perform this task without access to the perturbations, obtaining an estimate of them with signal processing algorithms, an approach we call "fingerprinting". We find the JPEG algorithm serves as a simple yet effective fingerprinter (85.05% accuracy), providing a strong baseline for future work. We discuss how our approach can be extended to attack agnostic, learnable fingerprints, and to open-world scenarios with unknown attacks.

In this work, we are interested in describing a set of well-known tools for assessing ABI, and testing them in a controlled set experiments to assess tool agreement. We run 7660 smaller experiments across tools (N=30,640 total results) to evaluate not only predictions, but also each tool's ability to provide detail about underlying issues. In this work, along with highlighting the problem of assessing ABI compatibility and critiquing the pros and cons of currently available tools, we provide guidance to developers interested to test ABI based on our empirical results and suggestions for future work.

However, watching the bug recordings and efficiently understanding the semantics of user actions can be time-consuming and tedious for developers. Inspired by the conception of the video subtitle in movie industry, we present a lightweight approach CAPdroid to caption bug recordings automatically. CAPdroid is a purely image-based and non-intrusive approach by using image processing and convolutional deep learning models to segment bug recordings, infer user action attributes, and generate subtitle descriptions. The automated experiments demonstrate the good performance of CAPdroid in inferring user actions from the recordings, and a user study confirms the usefulness of our generated step descriptions in assisting developers with bug replay.

> The threat of hardware Trojans (HTs) and their detection is a widely studied field. While the effort for inserting a Trojan into an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) can be considered relatively high, especially when trusting the chip manufacturer, programmable hardware is vulnerable to Trojan insertion even after the product has been shipped or during usage. At the same time, detecting dormant HTs with small or zero-overhead triggers and payloads on these platforms is still a challenging task, as the Trojan might not get activated during the chip verification using logical testing or physical measurements. In this work, we present a novel Trojan detection approach based on a technique known from integrated circuit (IC) failure analysis, capable of detecting virtually all classes of dormant Trojans. Using laser logic state imaging (LLSI), we show how supply voltage modulations can awaken inactive Trojans, making them detectable using laser voltage imaging techniques. Therefore, our technique does not require triggering the Trojan. To support our claims, we present three case studies on 28 and 20 SRAM- and flash-based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We demonstrate how to detect with high confidence small changes in sequential and combinatorial logic as well as in the routing configuration of FPGAs in a non-invasive manner. Finally, we discuss the practical applicability of our approach on dormant analog Trojans in ASICs.

> This paper argues and shows that speculative vectorization, where a loop with rare or unknown memory dependencies are still vectorized, is fundamentally vulnerable and cannot be mitigated by existing defenses. We implement a simple proof of concept and show the leakage in Apple M2 SoC. We describe the source of leakage using Microarchitectural Leakage Descriptors MLD and we additionally describe principles to extend MLD for other optimization. Also as part of implementation we reverse engineer the M2 cache size and use threaded timer to differentiate between cache hit and miss.

> Novel AI-based code-writing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's Codex have demonstrated capabilities in many coding-adjacent domains. In this work we consider how LLMs maybe leveraged to automatically repair security relevant bugs present in hardware designs. We focus on bug repair in code written in the Hardware Description Language Verilog. For this study we build a corpus of domain-representative hardware security bugs. We then design and implement a framework to quantitatively evaluate the performance of any LLM tasked with fixing the specified bugs. The framework supports design space exploration of prompts (i.e., prompt engineering) and identifying the best parameters for the LLM. We show that an ensemble of LLMs can repair all ten of our benchmarks. This ensemble outperforms the state-of-the-art Cirfix hardware bug repair tool on its own suite of bugs. These results show that LLMs can repair hardware security bugs and the framework is an important step towards the ultimate goal of an automated end-to-end bug repair framework.

- `2111.11169v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11169v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11169v2)

> Scripting languages are continuously gaining popularity due to their ease of use and the flourishing software ecosystems that surround them. These languages offer crash and memory safety by design, thus, developers do not need to understand and prevent low-level security issues like the ones plaguing the C code. However, scripting languages often allow native extensions, which are a way for custom C/C++ code to be invoked directly from the high-level language. While this feature promises several benefits such as increased performance or the reuse of legacy code, it can also break the language's guarantees, e.g., crash-safety. In this work, we first provide a comparative analysis of the security risks of native extension APIs in three popular scripting languages. Additionally, we discuss a novel methodology for studying the misuse of the native extension API. We then perform an in-depth study of npm, an ecosystem which is most exposed to threats introduced by native extensions. We show that vulnerabilities in extensions can be exploited in their embedding library by producing reads of uninitialized memory, hard crashes or memory leaks in 33 npm packages, simply by invoking their API with well-crafted inputs. Moreover, we identify six open-source web applications in which such exploits can be deployed remotely by a weak adversary. Finally, we were assigned seven security advisories for the work presented in this paper, most labeled as high severity.

> Spatial memory safety violation is still a major issue for C programs. Checked-C is a safe dialect of C and extends it with Checked pointer types and annotations that guarantee spatial memory safety in a backward-compatible manner, allowing the mix of checked pointers and regular (unchecked) pointer types. However, unchecked code vulnerabilities can violate the checked code's spatial safety guarantees. We present CheckedCBox, which adds a flexible, type-directed program partitioning mechanism to Checked-C, by enhancing the Checked-C type system with tainted types that enable flexible partitioning of the program into checked and unchecked regions, in a manner such that unchecked region code does not affect the spatial safety in the checked region. We formalize our type system and prove the non-crashing and non-exposure properties of a well-typed CheckedCBox program. We implemented CheckedCBox in a configurable manner, which enables us to use existing sandbox mechanisms (eg WebAssembly) to execute programs. Consequently, in doing so, CheckedCBox has prevented four known vulnerabilities by efficiently partitioning the program.

- `2211.07613v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07613v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07613v2)

> We provide an overview of recent developments and future directions in the RowHammer vulnerability that plagues modern DRAM (Dynamic Random Memory Access) chips, which are used in almost all computing systems as main memory.   RowHammer is the phenomenon in which repeatedly accessing a row in a real DRAM chip causes bitflips (i.e., data corruption) in physically nearby rows. This phenomenon leads to a serious and widespread system security vulnerability, as many works since the original RowHammer paper in 2014 have shown. Recent analysis of the RowHammer phenomenon reveals that the problem is getting much worse as DRAM technology scaling continues: newer DRAM chips are fundamentally more vulnerable to RowHammer at the device and circuit levels. Deeper analysis of RowHammer shows that there are many dimensions to the problem as the vulnerability is sensitive to many variables, including environmental conditions (temperature \& voltage), process variation, stored data patterns, as well as memory access patterns and memory control policies. As such, it has proven difficult to devise fully-secure and very efficient (i.e., low-overhead in performance, energy, area) protection mechanisms against RowHammer and attempts made by DRAM manufacturers have been shown to lack security guarantees.   After reviewing various recent developments in exploiting, understanding, and mitigating RowHammer, we discuss future directions that we believe are critical for solving the RowHammer problem. We argue for two major directions to amplify research and development efforts in: 1) building a much deeper understanding of the problem and its many dimensions, in both cutting-edge DRAM chips and computing systems deployed in the field, and 2) the design and development of extremely efficient and fully-secure solutions via system-memory cooperation.

<summary>2023-02-03 20:59:09 - Less, but Stronger: On the Value of Strong Heuristics in Semi-supervised Learning for Software Analytics</summary>

- *Huy Tu, Tim Menzies*

- `2302.01997v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01997v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01997v1)

> In many domains, there are many examples and far fewer labels for those examples; e.g. we may have access to millions of lines of source code, but access to only a handful of warnings about that code. In those domains, semi-supervised learners (SSL) can extrapolate labels from a small number of examples to the rest of the data. Standard SSL algorithms use ``weak'' knowledge (i.e. those not based on specific SE knowledge) such as (e.g.) co-train two learners and use good labels from one to train the other. Another approach of SSL in software analytics is potentially use ``strong'' knowledge that use SE knowledge. For example, an often-used heuristic in SE is that unusually large artifacts contain undesired properties (e.g. more bugs). This paper argues that such ``strong'' algorithms perform better than those standard, weaker, SSL algorithms. We show this by learning models from labels generated using weak SSL or our ``stronger'' FRUGAL algorithm. In four domains (distinguishing security-related bug reports; mitigating bias in decision-making; predicting issue close time; and (reducing false alarms in static code warnings), FRUGAL required only 2.5% of the data to be labeled yet out-performed standard semi-supervised learners that relied on (e.g.) some domain-independent graph theory concepts. Hence, for future work, we strongly recommend the use of strong heuristics for semi-supervised learning for SE applications. To better support other researchers, our scripts and data are on-line at https://github.com/HuyTu7/FRUGAL.

> The growing adoption of voice-enabled devices (e.g., smart speakers), particularly in smart home environments, has introduced many security vulnerabilities that pose significant threats to users' privacy and safety. When multiple devices are connected to a voice assistant, an attacker can cause serious damage if they can gain control of these devices. We ask where and how can an attacker issue clean voice commands stealthily across a physical barrier, and perform the first academic measurement study of this nature on the command injection attack. We present the BarrierBypass attack that can be launched against three different barrier-based scenarios termed across-door, across-window, and across-wall. We conduct a broad set of experiments to observe the command injection attack success rates for multiple speaker samples (TTS and live human recorded) at different command audio volumes (65, 75, 85 dB), and smart speaker locations (0.1-4.0m from barrier). Against Amazon Echo Dot 2, BarrierBypass is able to achieve 100% wake word and command injection success for the across-wall and across-window attacks, and for the across-door attack (up to 2 meters). At 4 meters for the across-door attack, BarrierBypass can achieve 90% and 80% injection accuracy for the wake word and command, respectively. Against Google Home mini BarrierBypass is able to achieve 100% wake word injection accuracy for all attack scenarios. For command injection BarrierBypass can achieve 100% accuracy for all the three barrier settings (up to 2 meters). For the across-door attack at 4 meters, BarrierBypass can achieve 80% command injection accuracy. Further, our demonstration using drones yielded high command injection success, up to 100%. Overall, our results demonstrate the potentially devastating nature of this vulnerability to control a user's device from outside of the device's physical space.

> Programmable logic controller (PLC) based industrial control systems (ICS) are used to monitor and control critical infrastructure. Integration of communication networks and an Internet of Things approach in ICS has increased ICS vulnerability to cyber-attacks. This work proposes novel unsupervised machine learning ensemble methods for anomaly detection in PLC-based ICS. The work presents two broad approaches to anomaly detection: a weighted voting ensemble approach with a learning algorithm based on coefficient of determination and a stacking-based ensemble approach using isolation forest meta-detector. The two ensemble methods were analyzed via an open-source PLC-based ICS subjected to multiple attack scenarios as a case study. The work considers four different learning models for the weighted voting ensemble method. Comparative performance analyses of five ensemble methods driven diverse base detectors are presented. Results show that stacking-based ensemble method using isolation forest meta-detector achieves superior performance to previous work on all performance metrics. Results also suggest that effective unsupervised ensemble methods, such as stacking-based ensemble having isolation forest meta-detector, can robustly detect anomalies in arbitrary ICS datasets. Finally, the presented results were validated by using statistical hypothesis tests.

> The absolute majority of software today is developed collaboratively using collaborative version control tools such as Git. It is a common practice that once a vulnerability is detected and fixed, the developers behind the software issue a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures or CVE record to alert the user community of the security hazard and urge them to integrate the security patch. However, some companies might not disclose their vulnerabilities and just update their repository. As a result, users are unaware of the vulnerability and may remain exposed. In this paper, we present a system to automatically identify security patches using only the developer behavior in the Git repository without analyzing the code itself or the remarks that accompanied the fix (commit message). We showed we can reveal concealed security patches with an accuracy of 88.3% and F1 Score of 89.8%. This is the first time that a language-oblivious solution for this problem is presented.

> Prior work has successfully incorporated optimization layers as the last layer in neural networks for various problems, thereby allowing joint learning and planning in one neural network forward pass. In this work, we identify a weakness in such a set-up where inputs to the optimization layer lead to undefined output of the neural network. Such undefined decision outputs can lead to possible catastrophic outcomes in critical real time applications. We show that an adversary can cause such failures by forcing rank deficiency on the matrix fed to the optimization layer which results in the optimization failing to produce a solution. We provide a defense for the failure cases by controlling the condition number of the input matrix. We study the problem in the settings of synthetic data, Jigsaw Sudoku, and in speed planning for autonomous driving, building on top of prior frameworks in end-to-end learning and optimization. We show that our proposed defense effectively prevents the framework from failing with undefined output. Finally, we surface a number of edge cases which lead to serious bugs in popular equation and optimization solvers which can be abused as well.

> Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has been proposed as a promising solution for addressing distribution shifts. It allows a base model to adapt to an unforeseen distribution during inference by leveraging the information from the batch of (unlabeled) test data. However, we uncover a novel security vulnerability of TTA based on the insight that predictions on benign samples can be impacted by malicious samples in the same batch. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose Distribution Invading Attack (DIA), which injects a small fraction of malicious data into the test batch. DIA causes models using TTA to misclassify benign and unperturbed test data, providing an entirely new capability for adversaries that is infeasible in canonical machine learning pipelines. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attack on multiple benchmarks across six TTA methods. In response, we investigate two countermeasures to robustify the existing insecure TTA implementations, following the principle of "security by design". Together, we hope our findings can make the community aware of the utility-security tradeoffs in deploying TTA and provide valuable insights for developing robust TTA approaches.

> In recent days, the proliferation of several existing and new cyber-attacks pose an axiomatic threat to the stability of financial services. It is hard to predict the nature of attacks that can trigger a serious financial crisis. The unprecedented digital transformation to financial services has been accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and it is still ongoing. Attackers are taking advantage of this transformation and pose a new global threat to financial stability and integrity. Many large organizations are switching from centralized finance (CeFi) to decentralized finance (DeFi) because decentralized finance has many advantages. Blockchain can bring big and far-reaching effects on the trustworthiness, safety, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and openness of the financial sector. The present paper gives an in-depth look at how blockchain and federated learning (FL) are used in financial services. It starts with an overview of recent developments in both use cases. This paper explores and discusses existing financial service vulnerabilities, potential threats, and consequent risks. So, we explain the problems that can be fixed in financial services and how blockchain and FL could help solve them. These problems include data protection, storage optimization, and making more money in financial services. We looked at many blockchain-enabled FL methods and came up with some possible solutions that could be used in financial services to solve several challenges like cost-effectiveness, automation, and security control. Finally, we point out some future directions at the end of this study.

> The aggressive performance optimizations in modern microprocessors can result in security vulnerabilities. For example, timing-based attacks in processor caches can steal secret keys or break randomization. So far, finding cache-timing vulnerabilities is mostly performed by human experts, which is inefficient and laborious. There is a need for automatic tools that can explore vulnerabilities given that unreported vulnerabilities leave the systems at risk. In this paper, we propose AutoCAT, an automated exploration framework that finds cache timing-channel attack sequences using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AutoCAT formulates the cache timing-channel attack as a guessing game between an attack program and a victim program holding a secret. This guessing game can thus be solved via modern deep RL techniques. AutoCAT can explore attacks in various cache configurations without knowing design details and under different attack and victim program configurations. AutoCAT can also find attacks to bypass certain detection and defense mechanisms. In particular, AutoCAT discovered StealthyStreamline, a new attack that is able to bypass performance counter-based detection and has up to a 71% higher information leakage rate than the state-of-the-art LRU-based attacks on real processors. AutoCAT is the first of its kind in using RL for crafting microarchitectural timing-channel attack sequences and can accelerate cache timing-channel exploration for secure microprocessor designs.

> Estimating time-varying graphical models are of paramount importance in various social, financial, biological, and engineering systems, since the evolution of such networks can be utilized for example to spot trends, detect anomalies, predict vulnerability, and evaluate the impact of interventions. Existing methods require extensive tuning of parameters that control the graph sparsity and temporal smoothness. Furthermore, these methods are computationally burdensome with time complexity $O(NP^3)$ for $P$ variables and $N$ time points. As a remedy, we propose a low-complexity tuning-free Bayesian approach, named BASS. Specifically, we impose temporally-dependent spike-and-slab priors on the graphs such that they are sparse and varying smoothly across time. A variational inference algorithm is then derived to learn the graph structures from the data automatically. Owning to the pseudo-likelihood and the mean-field approximation, the time complexity of BASS is only $O(NP^2)$. Additionally, by identifying the frequency-domain resemblance to the time-varying graphical models, we show that BASS can be extended to learning frequency-varying inverse spectral density matrices, and yields graphical models for multivariate stationary time series. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data show that that BASS can better recover the underlying true graphs, while being more efficient than the existing methods, especially for high-dimensional cases.

> In this paper, we build a model named VuLASTE, which regards vulnerability detection as a special text classification task. To solve the vocabulary explosion problem, VuLASTE uses a byte level BPE algorithm from natural language processing. In VuLASTE, a new AST path embedding is added to represent source code nesting information. We also use a combination of global and dilated window attention from Longformer to extract long sequence semantic from source code. To solve the data imbalance problem, which is a common problem in vulnerability detection datasets, focal loss is used as loss function to make model focus on poorly classified cases during training. To test our model performance on real-world source code, we build a cross-language and multi-repository vulnerability dataset from Github Security Advisory Database. On this dataset, VuLASTE achieved top 50, top 100, top 200, top 500 hits of 29, 51, 86, 228, which are higher than state-of-art researches.

> JBMC is an open-source SAT- and SMT-based bounded model checking tool for verifying Java bytecode. JBMC relies on an operational model of the Java libraries, which conservatively approximates their semantics, to verify assertion violations, array out-of-bounds, unintended arithmetic overflows, and other kinds of functional and runtime errors in Java bytecode. JBMC can be used to either falsify properties or prove program correctness if an upper bound on the depth of the state-space is known. Practical applications of JBMC include but are not limited to bug finding, property checking, test input generation, detection of security vulnerabilities, and program synthesis. Here we provide a detailed description of JBMC's architecture and its functionalities, including an in-depth discussion of its background theories and underlying technologies, including a state-of-the-art string solver to ensure safety and security of Java bytecode.

> The C Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) demonstrates the violation of assertions in C programs, or proves safety of the assertions under a given bound. CBMC implements a bit-precise translation of an input C program, annotated with assertions and with loops unrolled to a given depth, into a formula. If the formula is satisfiable, then an execution leading to a violated assertion exists. CBMC is one of the most successful software verification tools. Its main advantages are its precision, robustness and simplicity. CBMC is shipped as part of several Linux distributions. It has been used by thousands of software developers to verify real-world software, such as the Linux kernel, and powers commercial software analysis and test generation tools. Table 1 gives an overview of CBMC's features. CBMC is also a versatile tool that can be applied to solve many practical program analysis problems such as bug finding, property checking, test input generation, detection of security vulnerabilities, equivalence checking and program synthesis. This chapter will give an introduction into CBMC, including practical examples and pointers to further reading. Moreover, we give insights about the development of CBMC itself, showing how its performance evolved over the last decade.

> Deep Neural Networks have proven to be highly accurate at a variety of tasks in recent years. The benefits of Deep Neural Networks have also been embraced in power grids to detect False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) while conducting critical tasks like state estimation. However, the vulnerabilities of DNNs along with the distinct infrastructure of cyber-physical-system (CPS) can favor the attackers to bypass the detection mechanism. Moreover, the divergent nature of CPS engenders limitations to the conventional defense mechanisms for False Data Injection Attacks. In this paper, we propose a DNN framework with additional layer which utilizes randomization to mitigate the adversarial effect by padding the inputs. The primary advantage of our method is when deployed to a DNN model it has trivial impact on the models performance even with larger padding sizes. We demonstrate the favorable outcome of the framework through simulation using the IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, 118-bus and 300-bus systems. Furthermore to justify the framework we select attack techniques that generate subtle adversarial examples that can bypass the detection mechanism effortlessly.

> Automated program repair is already deployed in industry, but concerns remain about repair quality. Recent research has shown that one of the main reasons repair tools produce incorrect (but seemingly correct) patches is imperfect fault localization (FL). This paper demonstrates that combining information from natural-language bug reports and test executions when localizing faults can have a significant positive impact on repair quality. For example, existing repair tools with such FL are able to correctly repair 7 defects in the Defects4J benchmark that no prior tools have repaired correctly. We develop, Blues, the first information-retrieval-based, statement-level FL technique that requires no training data. We further develop RAFL, the first unsupervised method for combining multiple FL techniques, which outperforms a supervised method. Using RAFL, we create SBIR by combining Blues with a spectrum-based (SBFL) technique. Evaluated on 815 real-world defects, SBIR consistently ranks buggy statements higher than its underlying techniques. We then modify three state-of-the-art repair tools, Arja, SequenceR, and SimFix, to use SBIR, SBFL, and Blues as their internal FL. We evaluate the quality of the produced patches on 689 real-world defects. Arja and SequenceR significantly benefit from SBIR: Arja using SBIR correctly repairs 28 defects, but only 21 using SBFL, and only 15 using Blues; SequenceR using SBIR correctly repairs 12 defects, but only 10 using SBFL, and only 4 using Blues. SimFix, (which has internal mechanisms to overcome poor FL), correctly repairs 30 defects using SBIR and SBFL, but only 13 using Blues. Our work is the first investigation of simultaneously using multiple software artifacts for automated program repair, and our promising findings suggest future research in this directions is likely to be fruitful.

> Previous studies have demonstrated that neural code comprehension models are vulnerable to identifier naming. By renaming as few as one identifier in the source code, the models would output completely irrelevant results, indicating that identifiers can be misleading for model prediction. However, identifiers are not completely detrimental to code comprehension, since the semantics of identifier names can be related to the program semantics. Well exploiting the two opposite impacts of identifiers is essential for enhancing the robustness and accuracy of neural code comprehension, and still remains under-explored. In this work, we propose to model the impact of identifiers from a novel causal perspective, and propose a counterfactual reasoning-based framework named CREAM. CREAM explicitly captures the misleading information of identifiers through multi-task learning in the training stage, and reduces the misleading impact by counterfactual inference in the inference stage. We evaluate CREAM on three popular neural code comprehension tasks, including function naming, defect detection and code classification. Experiment results show that CREAM not only significantly outperforms baselines in terms of robustness (e.g., +37.9% on the function naming task at F1 score), but also achieve improved results on the original datasets (e.g., +0.5% on the function naming task at F1 score).

> Previous research on code intelligence usually trains a deep learning model on a fixed dataset in an offline manner. However, in real-world scenarios, new code repositories emerge incessantly, and the carried new knowledge is beneficial for providing up-to-date code intelligence services to developers. In this paper, we aim at the following problem: How to enable code intelligence models to continually learn from ever-increasing data? One major challenge here is catastrophic forgetting, meaning that the model can easily forget knowledge learned from previous datasets when learning from the new dataset. To tackle this challenge, we propose REPEAT, a novel method for continual learning of code intelligence models. Specifically, REPEAT addresses the catastrophic forgetting problem with representative exemplars replay and adaptive parameter regularization. The representative exemplars replay component selects informative and diverse exemplars in each dataset and uses them to retrain model periodically. The adaptive parameter regularization component recognizes important parameters in the model and adaptively penalizes their changes to preserve the knowledge learned before. We evaluate the proposed approach on three code intelligence tasks including code summarization, software vulnerability detection, and code clone detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REPEAT consistently outperforms baseline methods on all tasks. For example, REPEAT improves the conventional fine-tuning method by 1.22, 5.61, and 1.72 on code summarization, vulnerability detection and clone detection, respectively.

> Patch prioritization ranks candidate patches based on their likelihood of being correct. The fixing ingredients that are more likely to be the fix for a bug, share a high contextual similarity. A recent study shows that combining both syntactic and semantic similarity for capturing the contextual similarity, can do better in prioritizing patches. In this study, we evaluate the impact of combining the syntactic and semantic features on patch prioritization using the Insertion mutation operators. This study inspects the result of different combinations of syntactic and semantic features on patch prioritization. As a pilot study, the approach uses genealogical similarity to measure the semantic similarity and normalized longest common subsequence, normalized edit distance, cosine similarity, and Jaccard similarity index to capture the syntactic similarity. It also considers Anti-Pattern to filter out the incorrect plausible patches. The combination of both syntactic and semantic similarity can reduce the search space to a great extent. Also, the approach generates fixes for the bugs before the incorrect plausible one. We evaluate the techniques on the IntroClassJava benchmark using Insertion mutation operators and successfully generate fixes for 6 bugs before the incorrect plausible one. So, considering the previous study, the approach of combining syntactic and semantic similarity can able to solve a total number of 25 bugs from the benchmark, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the highest number of bugs solved than any other approach. The correctness of the generated fixes are further checked using the publicly available results of CapGen and thus for the generated fixes, the approach achieves a precision of 100%

> Block-based programming languages like Scratch are increasingly popular for programming education and end-user programming. Recent program analyses build on the insight that source code can be modelled using techniques from natural language processing. Many of the regularities of source code that support this approach are due to the syntactic overhead imposed by textual programming languages. This syntactic overhead, however, is precisely what block-based languages remove in order to simplify programming. Consequently, it is unclear how well this modelling approach performs on block-based programming languages. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of language models for the popular block-based programming language Scratch. We model Scratch programs using n-gram models, the most essential type of language model, and transformers, a popular deep learning model. Evaluation on the example tasks of code completion and bug finding confirm that blocks inhibit predictability, but the use of language models is nevertheless feasible. Our findings serve as foundation for improving tooling and analyses for block-based languages.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial training (AT) is a popular and effective strategy to defend against adversarial attacks. Recent works (Benz et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2021) have shown that a robust model well-trained by AT exhibits a remarkable robustness disparity among classes, and propose various methods to obtain consistent robust accuracy across classes. Unfortunately, these methods sacrifice a good deal of the average robust accuracy. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel framework of worst-class adversarial training and leverages no-regret dynamics to solve this problem. Our goal is to obtain a classifier with great performance on worst-class and sacrifice just a little average robust accuracy at the same time. We then rigorously analyze the theoretical properties of our proposed algorithm, and the generalization error bound in terms of the worst-class robust risk. Furthermore, we propose a measurement to evaluate the proposed method in terms of both the average and worst-class accuracies. Experiments on various datasets and networks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

> Transformers have gained popularity in the software engineering (SE) literature. These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a self-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge about a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is the masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input (e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them. Once pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned to support the specific downstream task of interest (e.g., code summarization). While there is evidence suggesting the boost in performance provided by pre-training, little is known about the impact of the specific pre-training objective(s) used. Indeed, MLM is just one of the possible pre-training objectives and recent work from the natural language processing field suggest that pre-training objectives tailored for the specific downstream task of interest may substantially boost the model's performance. In this study, we focus on the impact of pre-training objectives on the performance of transformers when automating code-related tasks. We start with a systematic literature review aimed at identifying the pre-training objectives used in SE. Then, we pre-train 32 transformers using both (i) generic pre-training objectives usually adopted in SE; and (ii) pre-training objectives tailored to specific code-related tasks subject of our experimentation, namely bug-fixing, code summarization, and code completion. We also compare the pre-trained models with non pre-trained ones. Our results show that: (i) pre-training helps in boosting performance only if the amount of fine-tuning data available is small; (ii) the MLM objective is usually sufficient to maximize the prediction performance of the model, even when comparing it with pre-training objectives specialized for the downstream task at hand.

> Large-scale language models have achieved tremendous success across various natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, language models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which inject stealthy triggers into models for steering them to undesirable behaviors. Most existing backdoor attacks, such as data poisoning, require further (re)training or fine-tuning language models to learn the intended backdoor patterns. The additional training process however diminishes the stealthiness of the attacks, as training a language model usually requires long optimization time, a massive amount of data, and considerable modifications to the model parameters. In this work, we propose Training-Free Lexical Backdoor Attack (TFLexAttack) as the first training-free backdoor attack on language models. Our attack is achieved by injecting lexical triggers into the tokenizer of a language model via manipulating its embedding dictionary using carefully designed rules. These rules are explainable to human developers which inspires attacks from a wider range of hackers. The sparse manipulation of the dictionary also habilitates the stealthiness of our attack. We conduct extensive experiments on three dominant NLP tasks based on nine language models to demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our attack. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/Jinxhy/TFLexAttack.

> In real world datasets, particular groups are under-represented, much rarer than others, and machine learning classifiers will often preform worse on under-represented populations. This problem is aggravated across many domains where datasets are class imbalanced, with a minority class far rarer than the majority class. Naive approaches to handle under-representation and class imbalance include training sub-population specific classifiers that handle class imbalance or training a global classifier that overlooks sub-population disparities and aims to achieve high overall accuracy by handling class imbalance. In this study, we find that these approaches are vulnerable in class imbalanced datasets with minority sub-populations. We introduced Fair-Net, a branched multitask neural network architecture that improves both classification accuracy and probability calibration across identifiable sub-populations in class imbalanced datasets. Fair-Nets is a straightforward extension to the output layer and error function of a network, so can be incorporated in far more complex architectures. Empirical studies with three real world benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fair-Net improves classification and calibration performance, substantially reducing performance disparity between gender and racial sub-populations.

> Deep learning (DL) has attracted wide attention and has been widely deployed in recent years. As a result, more and more research efforts have been dedicated to testing DL libraries and frameworks. However, existing work largely overlooked one crucial component of any DL system, automatic differentiation (AD), which is the basis for the recent development of DL. To this end, we propose $\nabla$Fuzz, the first general and practical approach specifically targeting the critical AD component in DL libraries. Our key insight is that each DL library API can be abstracted into a function processing tensors/vectors, which can be differentially tested under various execution scenarios (for computing outputs/gradients with different implementations). We have implemented $\nabla$Fuzz as a fully automated API-level fuzzer targeting AD in DL libraries, which utilizes differential testing on different execution scenarios to test both first-order and high-order gradients, and also includes automated filtering strategies to remove false positives caused by numerical instability. We have performed an extensive study on four of the most popular and actively-maintained DL libraries, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and OneFlow. The result shows that $\nabla$Fuzz substantially outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of both code coverage and bug detection. To date, $\nabla$Fuzz has detected 173 bugs for the studied DL libraries, with 144 already confirmed by developers (117 of which are previously unknown bugs and 107 are related to AD). Remarkably, $\nabla$Fuzz contributed 58.3% (7/12) of all high-priority AD bugs for PyTorch and JAX during a two-month period. None of the confirmed AD bugs were detected by existing fuzzers.

> Although recent network representation learning (NRL) works in text-attributed networks demonstrated superior performance for various graph inference tasks, learning network representations could always raise privacy concerns when nodes represent people or human-related variables. Moreover, standard NRLs that leverage structural information from a graph proceed by first encoding pairwise relationships into learned representations and then analysing its properties. This approach is fundamentally misaligned with problems where the relationships involve multiple points, and topological structure must be encoded beyond pairwise interactions. Fortunately, the machinery of topological data analysis (TDA) and, in particular, simplicial neural networks (SNNs) offer a mathematically rigorous framework to learn higher-order interactions between nodes. It is critical to investigate if the representation outputs from SNNs are more vulnerable compared to regular representation outputs from graph neural networks (GNNs) via pairwise interactions. In my dissertation, I will first study learning the representations with text attributes for simplicial complexes (RT4SC) via SNNs. Then, I will conduct research on two potential attacks on the representation outputs from SNNs: (1) membership inference attack, which infers whether a certain node of a graph is inside the training data of the GNN model; and (2) graph reconstruction attacks, which infer the confidential edges of a text-attributed network. Finally, I will study a privacy-preserving deterministic differentially private alternating direction method of multiplier to learn secure representation outputs from SNNs that capture multi-scale relationships and facilitate the passage from local structure to global invariant features on text-attributed networks.

> Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Deep Learning (DL) in automated software vulnerability detection. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in learning the graph representations of source code and are commonly adopted by existing DL-based vulnerability detection methods. However, the existing methods are still limited by the fact that GNNs are essentially difficult to handle the connections between long-distance nodes in a code structure graph. Besides, they do not well exploit the multiple types of edges in a code structure graph (such as edges representing data flow and control flow). Consequently, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, the existing GNN-based methods tend to fail to capture global information (i.e., long-range dependencies among nodes) of code graphs. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel vulnerability detection framework with grAph siMplification and enhanced graph rePresentation LEarning, named AMPLE. AMPLE mainly contains two parts: 1) graph simplification, which aims at reducing the distances between nodes by shrinking the node sizes of code structure graphs; 2) enhanced graph representation learning, which involves one edge-aware graph convolutional network module for fusing heterogeneous edge information into node representations and one kernel-scaled representation module for well capturing the relations between distant graph nodes. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets show that AMPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 0.39%-35.32% and 7.64%-199.81% with respect to the accuracy and F1 score metrics, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPLE in learning global information of code graphs for vulnerability detection.

> As quantum computing is becoming increasingly popular, the underlying quantum computing platforms are growing both in ability and complexity. Unfortunately, testing these platforms is challenging due to the relatively small number of existing quantum programs and because of the oracle problem, i.e., a lack of specifications of the expected behavior of programs. This paper presents MorphQ, the first metamorphic testing approach for quantum computing platforms. Our two key contributions are (i) a program generator that creates a large and diverse set of valid (i.e., non-crashing) quantum programs, and (ii) a set of program transformations that exploit quantum-specific metamorphic relationships to alleviate the oracle problem. Evaluating the approach by testing the popular Qiskit platform shows that the approach creates over 8k program pairs within two days, many of which expose crashes. Inspecting the crashes, we find 13 bugs, nine of which have already been confirmed. MorphQ widens the slim portfolio of testing techniques of quantum computing platforms, helping to create a reliable software stack for this increasingly important field.

> The wide success of Bitcoin has led to a huge surge of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). Most altcoins essentially fork Bitcoin's code with minor modifications, such as the number of coins to be minted, the block size, and the block generation time. As such, they are often deemed identical to Bitcoin in terms of security, robustness, and maturity.   In this paper, we show that this common conception is misleading. By mining data retrieved from the GitHub repositories of various altcoin projects, we estimate the time it took to propagate relevant patches from Bitcoin to the altcoins. We find that, while the Bitcoin development community is quite active in fixing security flaws of Bitcoin's code base, forked cryptocurrencies are not as rigorous in patching the same vulnerabilities (inherited from Bitcoin). In some cases, we observe that even critical vulnerabilities, discovered and fixed within the Bitcoin community, have been addressed by the altcoins tens of months after disclosure. Besides raising awareness of this problem, our work aims to motivate the need for a proper responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities to all forked chains prior to reporting them publicly.

> Attackers may attempt exploiting Internet of Things (IoT) devices to operate them unduly as well as to gather personal data of the legitimate device owners'. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) sessions help to verify the effectiveness of the adopted security measures. However, VAPT over IoT devices, namely VAPT targeted at IoT devices, is an open research challenge due to the variety of target technologies and to the creativity it may require. Therefore, this article aims at guiding penetration testers to conduct VAPT sessions over IoT devices by means of a new cyber Kill Chain (KC) termed PETIoT. Several practical applications of PETIoT confirm that it is general, while its main novelty lies in the combination of attack and defence steps. PETIoT is demonstrated on a relevant example, the best-selling IP camera on Amazon Italy, the TAPO C200 by TP-Link, assuming an attacker who sits on the same network as the device's in order to assess all the network interfaces of the device. Additional knowledge is generated in terms of three zero-day vulnerabilities found and practically exploited on the camera, one of these with High severity and the other two with Medium severity by the CVSS standard. These are camera Denial of Service (DoS), motion detection breach and video stream breach. The application of PETIoT culminates with the proof-of-concept of a home-made fix, based on an inexpensive Raspberry Pi 4 Model B device, for the last vulnerability. Ultimately, our responsible disclosure with the camera vendor led to the release of a firmware update that fixes all found vulnerabilities, confirming that PetIoT has valid impact in real-world scenarios.

> In this digital era, our privacy is under constant threat as our personal data and traceable online/offline activities are frequently collected, processed and transferred by many software applications. Privacy attacks are often formed by exploiting vulnerabilities found in those software applications. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) systems are currently the main sources that software engineers rely on for understanding and preventing publicly disclosed software vulnerabilities. However, our study on all 922 weaknesses in the CWE and 156,537 vulnerabilities registered in the CVE to date has found a very small coverage of privacy-related vulnerabilities in both systems, only 4.45\% in CWE and 0.1\% in CVE. These also cover only a small number of areas of privacy threats that have been raised in existing privacy software engineering research, privacy regulations and frameworks, and relevant reputable organisations. The actionable insights generated from our study led to the introduction of 11 new common privacy weaknesses to supplement the CWE system, making it become a source for both security and privacy vulnerabilities.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noises. Adversarial training is a general and effective strategy to improve DNN robustness (i.e., accuracy on noisy data) against adversarial noises. However, DNN models trained by the current existing adversarial training methods may have much lower standard accuracy (i.e., accuracy on clean data), compared to the same models trained by the standard method on clean data, and this phenomenon is known as the trade-off between accuracy and robustness and is considered unavoidable. This issue prevents adversarial training from being used in many application domains, such as medical image analysis, as practitioners do not want to sacrifice standard accuracy too much in exchange for adversarial robustness. Our objective is to lift (i.e., alleviate or even avoid) this trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness for medical image classification and segmentation. We propose a novel adversarial training method, named Increasing-Margin Adversarial (IMA) Training, which is supported by an equilibrium state analysis about the optimality of adversarial training samples. Our method aims to preserve accuracy while improving robustness by generating optimal adversarial training samples. We evaluate our method and the other eight representative methods on six publicly available image datasets corrupted by noises generated by AutoAttack and white-noise attack. Our method achieves the highest adversarial robustness for image classification and segmentation with the smallest reduction in accuracy on clean data. For one of the applications, our method improves both accuracy and robustness. Our study has demonstrated that our method can lift the trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness for the image classification and segmentation applications.

> Due to the completely open-source nature of Android, the exploitable vulnerability of malware attacks is increasing. Machine learning, leading to a great evolution in Android malware detection in recent years, is typically applied in the classification phase. Since the correlation between features is ignored in some traditional ranking-based feature selection algorithms, applying wrapper-based feature selection models is a topic worth investigating. Though considering the correlation between features, wrapper-based approaches are time-consuming for exploring all possible valid feature subsets when processing a large number of Android features. To reduce the computational expense of wrapper-based feature selection, a framework named DroidRL is proposed. The framework deploys DDQN algorithm to obtain a subset of features which can be used for effective malware classification. To select a valid subset of features over a larger range, the exploration-exploitation policy is applied in the model training phase. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is used as the decision network of DDQN to give the framework the ability to sequentially select features. Word embedding is applied for feature representation to enhance the framework's ability to find the semantic relevance of features. The framework's feature selection exhibits high performance without any human intervention and can be ported to other feature selection tasks with minor changes. The experiment results show a significant effect when using the Random Forest as DroidRL's classifier, which reaches 95.6% accuracy with only 24 features selected.

> The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples has attracted great attention in the machine learning community. The problem is related to non-flatness and non-smoothness of normally obtained loss landscapes. Training augmented with adversarial examples (a.k.a., adversarial training) is considered as an effective remedy. In this paper, we highlight that some collaborative examples, nearly perceptually indistinguishable from both adversarial and benign examples yet show extremely lower prediction loss, can be utilized to enhance adversarial training. A novel method is therefore proposed to achieve new state-of-the-arts in adversarial robustness. Code: https://github.com/qizhangli/ST-AT.

> Social coding platforms such as GitHub have become defacto environments for collaborative programming and open source. When these platforms do not support specific cognitive styles, they create barriers to programming for some populations. Research shows that the cognitive styles typically favored by women are often unsupported, creating barriers to entry for woman newcomers. In this paper, we use the GenderMag method to evaluate GitHub to find cognitive style-specific inclusivity bugs. We redesigned the "buggy" GitHub features through a web browser plugin, which we evaluated through a between-subjects experiment (n=75). Our results indicate that the changes to the interface improve users' performance and self-efficacy, mainly for individuals with cognitive styles more common to women. Our results can inspire designers of social coding platforms and software engineering tools to produce more inclusive development environments.

> This work extends an existing virtual multi-agent platform called RoboSumo to create TripleSumo -- a platform for investigating multi-agent cooperative behaviors in continuous action spaces, with physical contact in an adversarial environment. In this paper we investigate a scenario in which two agents, namely `Bug' and `Ant', must team up and push another agent `Spider' out of the arena. To tackle this goal, the newly added agent `Bug' is trained during an ongoing match between `Ant' and `Spider'. `Bug' must develop awareness of the other agents' actions, infer the strategy of both sides, and eventually learn an action policy to cooperate. The reinforcement learning algorithm Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is implemented with a hybrid reward structure combining dense and sparse rewards. The cooperative behavior is quantitatively evaluated by the mean probability of winning the match and mean number of steps needed to win.

> Engineering more secure software has become a critical challenge in the cyber world. It is very important to develop methodologies, techniques, and tools for developing secure software. To develop secure software, software developers need to think like an attacker through mining software repositories. These aim to analyze and understand the data repositories related to software development. The main goal is to use these software repositories to support the decision-making process of software development. There are different vulnerability databases like Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database (CVE), and CAPEC. We utilized a database called MITRE. MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques have been used in various ways and methods, but tools for utilizing these tactics and techniques in the early stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) are lacking. In this paper, we use machine learning algorithms to map requirements to the MITRE ATT&CK database and determine the accuracy of each mapping depending on the data split.

> This study aimed to stimulate the brain's executive function through a series of tasks and rules based on dynamic perceptual stimuli using the Biotechnology Virtual Immersion Simulator (BIOVIT) and thus evaluate its usefulness to maintain and increase attention levels in subjects diagnosed with hyperkinetic syndrome. With a quantitative methodology framed in a longitudinal trend design, the cause of the exposure-outcome relationships was studied using the BIOVIT simulator. Exploratory analysis of oscillatory brain activity was measured using a graphical recording of brain electrical activity and attention levels. Data consisted of 77,566 observations from n = 18 separately studied participants. The findings established that the BIOVIT simulator maintained and increased the attention levels of the participants by 77.8%. Furthermore, the hypothesis was tested that virtual reality immersion technologies significantly affect attention levels in participants aged 8 to 12. The evidence shows that the BIOVIT simulator is an alternative to developing learning methodologies in vulnerable populations. The low implementation costs and the diversity of academic applications may allow schools in developing countries to solve this problem that afflicts thousands of children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising results in various tasks such as node classification and graph classification. Recent studies find that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, effective backdoor attacks on graphs are still an open problem. In particular, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. The backdoored GNNs trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes to target class once attached with triggers. Though there are some initial efforts in graph backdoor attacks, our empirical analysis shows that they may require a large attack budget for effective backdoor attacks and the injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with limited attack budget. To fully utilize the attack budget, we propose to deliberately select the nodes to inject triggers and target class labels in the poisoning phase. An adaptive trigger generator is deployed to obtain effective triggers that are difficult to be noticed. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets against various defense strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in conducting effective unnoticeable backdoor attacks.

> This paper presents a data-driven framework to improve the trustworthiness of US tax preparation software systems. Given the legal implications of bugs in such software on its users, ensuring compliance and trustworthiness of tax preparation software is of paramount importance. The key barriers in developing debugging aids for tax preparation systems are the unavailability of explicit specifications and the difficulty of obtaining oracles. We posit that, since the US tax law adheres to the legal doctrine of precedent, the specifications about the outcome of tax preparation software for an individual taxpayer must be viewed in comparison with individuals that are deemed similar. Consequently, these specifications are naturally available as properties on the software requiring similar inputs provide similar outputs. Inspired by the metamorphic testing paradigm, we dub these relations metamorphic relations.   In collaboration with legal and tax experts, we explicated metamorphic relations for a set of challenging properties from various US Internal Revenue Services (IRS) publications including Publication 596 (Earned Income Tax Credit), Schedule 8812 (Qualifying Children/Other Dependents), and Form 8863 (Education Credits). We focus on an open-source tax preparation software for our case study and develop a randomized test-case generation strategy to systematically validate the correctness of tax preparation software guided by metamorphic relations. We further aid this test-case generation by visually explaining the behavior of software on suspicious instances using easy to-interpret decision-tree models. Our tool uncovered several accountability bugs with varying severity ranging from non-robust behavior in corner-cases (unreliable behavior when tax returns are close to zero) to missing eligibility conditions in the updated versions of software.

> We demonstrate the security vulnerability of the ideal Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) key exchanger against transient attacks. Transients start when Alice and Bob connect the wire to their chosen resistor at the beginning of each clock cycle. A transient attack takes place during a short duration of time, before the transients reflected from the end of Alice and Bob mix together. The information leak arises from the fact that Eve (the eavesdropper) monitors the cable, and analyzes the transients during this time period. We will demonstrate such a transient attack, and, then we introduce a defense protocol to protect against the attack. Computer simulations demonstrate that after applying the defense method the information leak becomes negligible.

> Exploiting social media to spread hate has tremendously increased over the years. Lately, multi-modal hateful content such as memes has drawn relatively more traction than uni-modal content. Moreover, the availability of implicit content payloads makes them fairly challenging to be detected by existing hateful meme detection systems. In this paper, we present a use case study to analyze such systems' vulnerabilities against external adversarial attacks. We find that even very simple perturbations in uni-modal and multi-modal settings performed by humans with little knowledge about the model can make the existing detection models highly vulnerable. Empirically, we find a noticeable performance drop of as high as 10% in the macro-F1 score for certain attacks. As a remedy, we attempt to boost the model's robustness using contrastive learning as well as an adversarial training-based method - VILLA. Using an ensemble of the above two approaches, in two of our high resolution datasets, we are able to (re)gain back the performance to a large extent for certain attacks. We believe that ours is a first step toward addressing this crucial problem in an adversarial setting and would inspire more such investigations in the future.

> Unsupervised/self-supervised graph neural networks (GNN) are vulnerable to inherent randomness in the input graph data which greatly affects the performance of the model in downstream tasks. In this paper, we alleviate the interference of graph randomness and learn appropriate representations of nodes without label information. To this end, we propose USER, an unsupervised robust version of graph neural networks that is based on structural entropy. We analyze the property of intrinsic connectivity and define intrinsic connectivity graph. We also identify the rank of the adjacency matrix as a crucial factor in revealing a graph that provides the same embeddings as the intrinsic connectivity graph. We then introduce structural entropy in the objective function to capture such a graph. Extensive experiments conducted on clustering and link prediction tasks under random-noises and meta-attack over three datasets show USER outperforms benchmarks and is robust to heavier randomness.

> Currently, natural language processing (NLP) models are wildly used in various scenarios. However, NLP models, like all deep models, are vulnerable to adversarially generated text. Numerous works have been working on mitigating the vulnerability from adversarial attacks. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive defense in existing works where each work targets a specific attack category or suffers from the limitation of computation overhead, irresistible to adaptive attack, etc.   In this paper, we exhaustively investigate the adversarial attack algorithms in NLP, and our empirical studies have discovered that the attack algorithms mainly disrupt the importance distribution of words in a text. A well-trained model can distinguish subtle importance distribution differences between clean and adversarial texts. Based on this intuition, we propose TextDefense, a new adversarial example detection framework that utilizes the target model's capability to defend against adversarial attacks while requiring no prior knowledge. TextDefense differs from previous approaches, where it utilizes the target model for detection and thus is attack type agnostic. Our extensive experiments show that TextDefense can be applied to different architectures, datasets, and attack methods and outperforms existing methods. We also discover that the leading factor influencing the performance of TextDefense is the target model's generalizability. By analyzing the property of the target model and the property of the adversarial example, we provide our insights into the adversarial attacks in NLP and the principles of our defense method.

> Deep learning (DL) models of code have recently reported great progress for vulnerability detection. In some cases, DL-based models have outperformed static analysis tools. Although many great models have been proposed, we do not yet have a good understanding of these models. This limits the further advancement of model robustness, debugging, and deployment for the vulnerability detection. In this paper, we surveyed and reproduced 9 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on 2 widely used vulnerability detection datasets: Devign and MSR. We investigated 6 research questions in three areas, namely model capabilities, training data, and model interpretation. We experimentally demonstrated the variability between different runs of a model and the low agreement among different models' outputs. We investigated models trained for specific types of vulnerabilities compared to a model that is trained on all the vulnerabilities at once. We explored the types of programs DL may consider "hard" to handle. We investigated the relations of training data sizes and training data composition with model performance. Finally, we studied model interpretations and analyzed important features that the models used to make predictions. We believe that our findings can help better understand model results, provide guidance on preparing training data, and improve the robustness of the models. All of our datasets, code, and results are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20791240.

> This paper introduces BURT, a web-based chatbot for interactive reporting of Android app bugs. BURT is designed to assist Android app end-users in reporting high-quality defect information using an interactive interface. BURT guides the users in reporting essential bug report elements, i.e., the observed behavior, expected behavior, and the steps to reproduce the bug. It verifies the quality of the text written by the user and provides instant feedback. In addition, BURT provides graphical suggestions that the users can choose as alternatives to textual descriptions. We empirically evaluated BURT, asking end-users to report bugs from six Android apps. The reporters found that BURT's guidance and automated suggestions and clarifications are useful and BURT is easy to use. BURT is an open-source tool, available at github.com/sea-lab-wm/burt/tree/tool-demo. A video showing the full capabilities of BURT can be found at https://youtu.be/SyfOXpHYGRo

> Advanced Patch Attacks (PAs) on object detection in natural images have pointed out the great safety vulnerability in methods based on deep neural networks. However, little attention has been paid to this topic in Optical Remote Sensing Images (O-RSIs). To this end, we focus on this research, i.e., PAs on object detection in O-RSIs, and propose a more Threatening PA without the scarification of the visual quality, dubbed TPA. Specifically, to address the problem of inconsistency between local and global landscapes in existing patch selection schemes, we propose leveraging the First-Order Difference (FOD) of the objective function before and after masking to select the sub-patches to be attacked. Further, considering the problem of gradient inundation when applying existing coordinate-based loss to PAs directly, we design an IoU-based objective function specific for PAs, dubbed Bounding box Drifting Loss (BDL), which pushes the detected bounding boxes far from the initial ones until there are no intersections between them. Finally, on two widely used benchmarks, i.e., DIOR and DOTA, comprehensive evaluations of our TPA with four typical detectors (Faster R-CNN, FCOS, RetinaNet, and YOLO-v4) witness its remarkable effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the PAs on object detection in O-RSIs, and we hope this work can get our readers interested in studying this topic.

> Despite superior performance in many situations, deep neural networks are often vulnerable to adversarial examples and distribution shifts, limiting model generalization ability in real-world applications. To alleviate these problems, recent approaches leverage distributional robustness optimization (DRO) to find the most challenging distribution, and then minimize loss function over this most challenging distribution. Regardless of achieving some improvements, these DRO approaches have some obvious limitations. First, they purely focus on local regularization to strengthen model robustness, missing a global regularization effect which is useful in many real-world applications (e.g., domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial machine learning). Second, the loss functions in the existing DRO approaches operate in only the most challenging distribution, hence decouple with the original distribution, leading to a restrictive modeling capability. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization technique, following the veins of Wasserstein-based DRO framework. Specifically, we define a particular joint distribution and Wasserstein-based uncertainty, allowing us to couple the original and most challenging distributions for enhancing modeling capability and applying both local and global regularizations. Empirical studies on different learning problems demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing regularization approaches in various domains: semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial machine learning.

> Advances in manufacturing technologies have enabled System-on-Chip (SoC) designers to integrate an increasing number of cores on a single SoC. Increasing SoC complexity coupled with tight time-to-market deadlines has led to increased utilization of Intellectual Property (IP) cores from third-party vendors. SoC supply chain is widely acknowledged as a major source of security vulnerabilities. Potentially malicious third-party IPs integrated on the same Network-on-Chip (NoC) with the trusted components can lead to security and trust concerns. While secure communication is a well-studied problem in the computer networks domain, it is not feasible to implement those solutions on resource-constrained SoCs. In this paper, we present a lightweight encryption and anonymous routing protocol for communication between IP cores in NoC based SoCs. Our method eliminates the major overhead associated with traditional encryption and anonymous routing protocols using a novel secret sharing mechanism while ensuring that the desired security goals are met. Experimental results demonstrate that existing security solutions on NoC can introduce significant (1.5X) performance degradation, whereas our approach provides the same security features with minor (4%) impact on performance.

> Code search aims to retrieve accurate code snippets based on a natural language query to improve software productivity and quality. With the massive amount of available programs such as (on GitHub or Stack Overflow), identifying and localizing the precise code is critical for the software developers. In addition, Deep learning has recently been widely applied to different code-related scenarios, e.g., vulnerability detection, source code summarization. However, automated deep code search is still challenging since it requires a high-level semantic mapping between code and natural language queries. Most existing deep learning-based approaches for code search rely on the sequential text i.e., feeding the program and the query as a flat sequence of tokens to learn the program semantics while the structural information is not fully considered. Furthermore, the widely adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved their effectiveness in learning program semantics, however, they also suffer the problem of capturing the global dependencies in the constructed graph, which limits the model learning capacity. To address these challenges, in this paper, we design a novel neural network framework, named GraphSearchNet, to enable an effective and accurate source code search by jointly learning the rich semantics of both source code and natural language queries. Specifically, we propose to construct graphs for the source code and queries with bidirectional GGNN (BiGGNN) to capture the local structural information of the source code and queries. Furthermore, we enhance BiGGNN by utilizing the multi-head attention module to supplement the global dependencies that BiGGNN missed to improve the model learning capacity. The extensive experiments on Java and Python programming language from the public benchmark CodeSearchNet confirm that GraphSearchNet outperforms current state-of-the-art works.

> Since buffer overflow has long been a frequently occurring, high-risk vulnerability, various methods have been developed to support spatial memory safety and prevent buffer overflow. However, every proposed method, although effective in part, has its limitations. Due to expensive bound-checking or large memory in taking for metadata, the software-only support for spatial memory safety inherently entails runtime overhead. Contrastingly, hardware-assisted methods are not available without specific hardware assistants. To mitigate such limitations, Herein we propose L4 Pointer, which is a 128-bit pointer extended from a normal 64-bit virtual addresses. By using the extra bits and widespread SIMD operations, L4 Pointer shows less slow-down and higher performance without hardware extension than existing methods.

> Cryptographic algorithm agility is an important property for DNSSEC: it allows easy deployment of new algorithms if the existing ones are no longer secure. In this work we show that the cryptographic agility in DNSSEC, although critical for provisioning DNS with strong cryptography, also introduces a vulnerability. We find that under certain conditions, when new algorithms are listed in signed DNS responses, the resolvers do not validate DNSSEC. As a result, domains that deploy new ciphers may in fact cause the resolvers not to validate DNSSEC. We exploit this to develop DNSSEC-downgrade attacks and experimentally and ethically evaluate them against popular DNS resolver implementations, public DNS providers, and DNS services used by web clients worldwide. We find that major DNS providers as well as 45% of DNS resolvers used by web clients are vulnerable to our attacks.

> A Bug Inducing Commit (BIC) is a commit that introduces a software bug into the codebase. Knowing the relevant BIC for a given bug can provide valuable information for debugging as well as bug triaging. However, existing BIC identification techniques are either too expensive (because they require the failing tests to be executed against previous versions for bisection) or inapplicable at the debugging time (because they require post hoc artefacts such as bug reports or bug fixes). We propose Fonte, an efficient and accurate BIC identification technique that only requires test coverage. Fonte combines Fault Localisation (FL) with BIC identification and ranks commits based on the suspiciousness of the code elements that they modified. Fonte reduces the search space of BICs using failure coverage as well as a filter that detects commits that are merely style changes. Our empirical evaluation using 130 real-world BICs shows that Fonte significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIC identification techniques based on Information Retrieval as well as neural code embedding models, achieving at least 39% higher MRR. We also report that the ranking scores produced by Fonte can be used to perform weighted bisection, further reducing the cost of BIC identification. Finally, we apply Fonte to a large-scale industry project with over 10M lines of code, and show that it can rank the actual BIC within the top five commits for 87% of the studied real batch-testing failures, and save the BIC inspection cost by 32% on average.

> Due to convenience, open-source software is widely used. For beneficial reasons, open-source maintainers often fix the vulnerabilities silently, exposing their users unaware of the updates to threats. Previous works all focus on black-box binary detection of the silent dependency alerts that suffer from high false-positive rates. Open-source software users need to analyze and explain AI prediction themselves. Explainable AI becomes remarkable as a complementary of black-box AI models, providing details in various forms to explain AI decisions. Noticing there is still no technique that can discover silent dependency alert on time, in this work, we propose a framework using an encoder-decoder model with a binary detector to provide explainable silent dependency alert prediction. Our model generates 4 types of vulnerability key aspects including vulnerability type, root cause, attack vector, and impact to enhance the trustworthiness and users' acceptance to alert prediction. By experiments with several models and inputs, we confirm CodeBERT with both commit messages and code changes achieves the best results. Our user study shows that explainable alert predictions can help users find silent dependency alert more easily than black-box predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work on the application of Explainable AI in silent dependency alert prediction, which opens the door of the related domains.

> Never before has any OS been so popular as Android. Existing mobile phones are not simply devices for making phone calls and receiving SMS messages, but powerful communication and entertainment platforms for web surfing, social networking, etc. Even though the Android OS offers powerful communication and application execution capabilities, it is riddled with defects (e.g., security risks, and compatibility issues), new vulnerabilities come to light daily, and bugs cost the economy tens of billions of dollars annually. For example, malicious apps (e.g., back-doors, fraud apps, ransomware, spyware, etc.) are reported [Google, 2022] to exhibit malicious behaviours, including privacy stealing, unwanted programs installed, etc. To counteract these threats, many works have been proposed that rely on static analysis techniques to detect such issues. However, static techniques are not sufficient on their own to detect such defects precisely. This will likely yield false positive results as static analysis has to make some trade-offs when handling complicated cases (e.g., object-sensitive vs. object-insensitive). In addition, static analysis techniques will also likely suffer from soundness issues because some complicated features (e.g., reflection, obfuscation, and hardening) are difficult to be handled [Sun et al., 2021b, Samhi et al., 2022].

> There is a rapid increase in the number of mobile banking applications' users due to an increase in smart mobile devices. Mobile banking is a financial transaction and service offered through mobile devices. Almost all financial institutions now provide mobile banking services to their customers. However, the security of mobile banking applications is of huge concern because of the amount of personal data and information they collect. If an attacker gets hold of personal information, they can access bank payment or card accounts. This research aims to analyze the vulnerability of the UK digital banks' applications to identify vulnerabilities in the apps and proffer countermeasures that can help improve the security of the bank applications. Androbugs, a vulnerability scanner, was used to analyze the vulnerability of six digital banks' android applications. Starling, Monese, Atom bank, Transferwise, Monzo, and Revolut were scanned. All the scanned digital banks' applications have vulnerabilities; however, some have more vulnerabilities than others. For example, Revolut's mobile application has the highest number of identified vulnerabilities. Therefore, there is need for more security in the digital banks' applications as well as other mobile banking applications.

> Although numerous defenses against memory vulnerability exploits have been studied so far, highly-compatible, precise, and efficient defense is still an open problem. In fact, existing defense methods have at least one of the following problems: they (1) cannot precisely protect structure fields, (2) incur high protection overheads, and/or (3) cannot maintain compatibility with existing code due to imposing memory layout change on the protected program.   In this paper, we propose a novel memory-protection method FIX-Sense that aims to solve all of these problems simultaneously. Our key idea is to perform memory protection based on field-sensitive data-flow integrity. Specifically, our method (1) computes a safe write-read relation for each memory object, at the structure-field granularity, based on field-sensitive value-flow analysis at the compile-time of the protected program. (2) At run-time, lightweight verification is performed to determine whether each memory read executed by the protected program belong to the safe write-read relation calculated for the memory object at compile time. (3) This verification is implemented by lightweight metadata management that tracks memory writes at the structure field granularity without changing the memory layout of the target program (especially the structure field layout).

> Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with limited supervision has been a popular research topic as it can significantly alleviate the annotation burden. Self-training has been successfully applied in semi-supervised learning tasks, but one drawback of self-training is that it is vulnerable to the label noise from incorrect pseudo labels. Inspired by the fact that samples with similar labels tend to share similar representations, we develop a neighborhood-based sample selection approach to tackle the issue of noisy pseudo labels. We further stabilize self-training via aggregating the predictions from different rounds during sample selection. Experiments on eight tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the strongest self-training baseline with 1.83% and 2.51% performance gain for text and graph datasets on average. Our further analysis demonstrates that our proposed data selection strategy reduces the noise of pseudo labels by 36.8% and saves 57.3% of the time when compared with the best baseline. Our code and appendices will be uploaded to https://github.com/ritaranx/NeST.

> The vulnerability of cyber-physical systems to cyber attack is well known, and the requirement to build cyber resilience into these systems has been firmly established. The key challenge this paper addresses is that maturing this discipline requires the development of techniques, tools, and processes for objectively, rigorously, and quantitatively measuring the attributes of cyber resilience. Researchers and program managers need to be able to determine if the implementation of a resilience solution actually increases the resilience of the system. In previous work, a table top exercise was conducted using a notional heavy vehicle on a fictitious military mission while under a cyber attack. While this exercise provided some useful data, more and higher fidelity data is required to refine the measurement methodology. This paper details the efforts made to construct a cost-effective experimentation infrastructure to provide such data. It also presents a case study using some of the data generated by the infrastructure.

> Auditing mechanisms for differential privacy use probabilistic means to empirically estimate the privacy level of an algorithm. For private machine learning, existing auditing mechanisms are tight: the empirical privacy estimate (nearly) matches the algorithm's provable privacy guarantee. But these auditing techniques suffer from two limitations. First, they only give tight estimates under implausible worst-case assumptions (e.g., a fully adversarial dataset). Second, they require thousands or millions of training runs to produce non-trivial statistical estimates of the privacy leakage.   This work addresses both issues. We design an improved auditing scheme that yields tight privacy estimates for natural (not adversarially crafted) datasets -- if the adversary can see all model updates during training. Prior auditing works rely on the same assumption, which is permitted under the standard differential privacy threat model. This threat model is also applicable, e.g., in federated learning settings. Moreover, our auditing scheme requires only two training runs (instead of thousands) to produce tight privacy estimates, by adapting recent advances in tight composition theorems for differential privacy. We demonstrate the utility of our improved auditing schemes by surfacing implementation bugs in private machine learning code that eluded prior auditing techniques.

> Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are currently the most promising paradigm for dealing with graph-structure data, while recent studies have also shown that GCNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Thus developing GCN models that are robust to such attacks become a hot research topic. However, the structural purification learning-based or robustness constraints-based defense GCN methods are usually designed for specific data or attacks, and introduce additional objective that is not for classification. Extra training overhead is also required in their design. To address these challenges, we conduct in-depth explorations on mid-frequency signals on graphs and propose a simple yet effective Mid-pass filter GCN (Mid-GCN). Theoretical analyses guarantee the robustness of signals through the mid-pass filter, and we also shed light on the properties of different frequency signals under adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on six benchmark graph data further verify the effectiveness of our designed Mid-GCN in node classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art GCNs under various adversarial attack strategies.

> Thanks to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, we have entered an era when technology and philosophy intersect in interesting ways. Sitting squarely at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). The more adept LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which they are embedded as more human-like than they really are. This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use philosophically loaded terms, such as "knows", "believes", and "thinks", when describing these systems. To mitigate this trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly stepping back to remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems of which they form a part, actually work. The hope is that increased scientific precision will encourage more philosophical nuance in the discourse around artificial intelligence, both within the field and in the public sphere.

> 3GPP has introduced Private 5G to support the next-generation industrial automation system (IAS) due to the versatility and flexibility of 5G architecture. Besides the 3.5GHz CBRS band, unlicensed spectrum bands, like 5GHz, are considered as an additional medium because of their free and abundant nature. However, while utilizing the unlicensed band, industrial equipment must coexist with incumbents, e.g., Wi-Fi, which could introduce new security threats and resuscitate old ones. In this paper, we propose a novel attack strategy conducted by a mobility-enabled malicious Wi-Fi access point (mmAP), namely \textit{PACMAN} attack, to exploit vulnerabilities introduced by heterogeneous coexistence. A mmAP is capable of moving around the physical surface to identify mission-critical devices, hopping through the frequency domain to detect the victim's operating channel, and launching traditional MAC layer-based attacks. The multi-dimensional mobility of the attacker makes it impervious to state-of-the-art detection techniques that assume static adversaries. In addition, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) based framework to intelligently design an attacker's multi-dimensional mobility in space and frequency. Mathematical analysis and extensive simulation results exhibit the adverse effect of the proposed mobility-powered attack.

> Wikipedia and many User-Generated Content (UGC) communities are known for producing reliable, quality content, but also for being vulnerable to false or misleading information. Previous work has shown that many hoaxes on Wikipedia go undetected for extended periods of time. But little is known about the creation of intentionally false or misleading information online. Does collective attention toward a topic increase the likelihood it will spawn disinformation? Here, we measure the relationship between allocation of attention and the production of hoax articles on the English Wikipedia. Analysis of traffic logs reveals that, compared to legitimate articles created on the same day, hoaxes tend to be more associated with traffic spikes preceding their creation. This is consistent with the idea that the supply of false or misleading information on a topic is driven by the attention it receives. These findings improve our comprehension of the determinants of disinformation in UGC communities and could help promote the integrity of knowledge on Wikipedia.

> Malware has been one of the most damaging threats to computers that span across multiple operating systems and various file formats. To defend against ever-increasing and ever-evolving malware, tremendous efforts have been made to propose a variety of malware detection that attempt to effectively and efficiently detect malware so as to mitigate possible damages as early as possible. Recent studies have shown that, on the one hand, existing ML and DL techniques enable superior solutions in detecting newly emerging and previously unseen malware. However, on the other hand, ML and DL models are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of adversarial examples. In this paper, we focus on malware with the file format of portable executable (PE) in the family of Windows operating systems, namely Windows PE malware, as a representative case to study the adversarial attack methods in such adversarial settings. To be specific, we start by first outlining the general learning framework of Windows PE malware detection based on ML/DL and subsequently highlighting three unique challenges of performing adversarial attacks in the context of Windows PE malware. Then, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic review to categorize the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against PE malware detection, as well as corresponding defenses to increase the robustness of Windows PE malware detection. Finally, we conclude the paper by first presenting other related attacks against Windows PE malware detection beyond the adversarial attacks and then shedding light on future research directions and opportunities. In addition, a curated resource list of adversarial attacks and defenses for Windows PE malware detection is also available at https://github.com/ryderling/adversarial-attacks-and-defenses-for-windows-pe-malware-detection.

> The aim of continual learning is to learn new tasks continuously (i.e., plasticity) without forgetting previously learned knowledge from old tasks (i.e., stability). In the scenario of online continual learning, wherein data comes strictly in a streaming manner, the plasticity of online continual learning is more vulnerable than offline continual learning because the training signal that can be obtained from a single data point is limited. To overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma in online continual learning, we propose an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network. Additionally, we introduce a novel structure-wise distillation loss and replace the commonly used batch normalization layer with a newly proposed stability-plasticity normalization module to train MuFAN that simultaneously maintains high plasticity and stability. MuFAN outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the significance and scalability of each proposed component: 1) multi-scale feature maps from a pre-trained encoder, 2) the structure-wise distillation loss, and 3) the stability-plasticity normalization module in MuFAN. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/whitesnowdrop/MuFAN.

> Port scanning is the process of attempting to connect to various network ports on a computing endpoint to determine which ports are open and which services are running on them. It is a common method used by hackers to identify vulnerabilities in a network or system. By determining which ports are open, an attacker can identify which services and applications are running on a device and potentially exploit any known vulnerabilities in those services. Consequently, it is important to detect port scanning because it is often the first step in a cyber attack. By identifying port scanning attempts, cybersecurity professionals can take proactive measures to protect the systems and networks before an attacker has a chance to exploit any vulnerabilities. Against this background, researchers have worked for over a decade to develop robust methods to detect port scanning. One such method revealed by a recent systematic review is the random forest supervised machine learning algorithm. The review revealed six existing studies using random forest since 2021. Unfortunately, those studies each exhibit different results, do not all use the same training and testing dataset, and only two include source code. Accordingly, the goal of this work was to reproduce the six random forest studies while addressing the apparent shortcomings. The outcomes are significant for researchers looking to explore random forest to detect port scanning and for practitioners interested in reliable technology to detect the early stages of cyber attack.

> As machine learning (ML) systems are being increasingly employed in the real world to handle sensitive tasks and make decisions in various fields, the security and privacy of those models have also become increasingly critical. In particular, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby adversaries have access to the training data and the opportunity to manipulate such data by inserting carefully developed samples into the training dataset. Although the NLP community has produced several studies on generating backdoor attacks proving the vulnerable state of language modes, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any work to combat such attacks. To bridge this gap, we present RobustEncoder: a novel clustering-based technique for detecting and removing backdoor attacks in the text domain. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in detecting and removing backdoor triggers.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed a hidden backdoor trigger during the training process for malicious prediction manipulation. These attacks pose great threats to the applications of DNNs under the real-world machine learning as a service (MLaaS) setting, where the deployed model is fully black-box while the users can only query and obtain its predictions. Currently, there are many existing defenses to reduce backdoor threats. However, almost all of them cannot be adopted in MLaaS scenarios since they require getting access to or even modifying the suspicious models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective black-box input-level backdoor detection, called SCALE-UP, which requires only the predicted labels to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we identify and filter malicious testing samples by analyzing their prediction consistency during the pixel-wise amplification process. Our defense is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed scaled prediction consistency) that the predictions of poisoned samples are significantly more consistent compared to those of benign ones when amplifying all pixel values. Besides, we also provide theoretical foundations to explain this phenomenon. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/JunfengGo/SCALE-UP.

> In Federated Learning (FL), models are as fragile as centrally trained models against adversarial examples. However, the adversarial robustness of federated learning remains largely unexplored. This paper casts light on the challenge of adversarial robustness of federated learning. To facilitate a better understanding of the adversarial vulnerability of the existing FL methods, we conduct comprehensive robustness evaluations on various attacks and adversarial training methods. Moreover, we reveal the negative impacts induced by directly adopting adversarial training in FL, which seriously hurts the test accuracy, especially in non-IID settings. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm called Decision Boundary based Federated Adversarial Training (DBFAT), which consists of two components (local re-weighting and global regularization) to improve both accuracy and robustness of FL systems. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DBFAT consistently outperforms other baselines under both IID and non-IID settings.

> Performance-enhancing mechanisms such as branch prediction, out-of-order execution, and return stack buffer (RSB) have been widely employed in today's modern processing units. Although successful in increasing the CPU performance, exploiting the design flaws and security bugs in these components have set the background for various types of microarchitectural attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown. While many attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre have been numerously implemented and analyzed on Intel processors, few researches have been carried out to evaluate their impact on ARM processors. Moreover, SpectreRSB vulnerability, the newer variant of spectre attack based on RSB, has been neglected in recent studies. In this work, we first evaluate the SpectreRSB vulnerability by implementing this attack on ARM processors, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been implemented and analyzed on ARM processors. We further present a security evaluation of ARM processors by implementing different variants of Spectre-family attacks. By analyzing the results obtained from various experiments, we evaluate ARM processors security regarding their diverse microarchitectural designs. We also introduce a high throughput and noise-free covert channel, based on the RSB structure. Based on our experiments, the throughput of the covert channel is 94.19KB/s with negligible error.

> We know the classical public cryptographic algorithms are based on certain NP-hard problems such as the integer factoring in RSA and the discrete logarithm in Diffie-Hellman. They are going to be vulnerable with fault-tolerant quantum computers. We also know that the uncertainty principle for quantum bits or qubits such as quantum key distribution or QKD based on the quantum uncertainty principle offers the information theoretical security. The interesting implication with the paradigm shifts from classical computing to quantum computing is that the NP-hardness used for classical cryptography may shift to the uncertainty principles for quantum cryptography including quantum symmetric encryption, post-quantum cryptography, as well as quantum encryption in phase space for coherent optical communications. This paper would like to explore those so-called generalized uncertainty principles and explain what their implications are for quantum security. We identified three generalized uncertainty principles offering quantum security: non-commutability between permutation gates, non-commutability between the displacement and phase shift operators for coherent states, and the modular Diophantine Equation Problem in general linear algebra for post-quantum cryptography.

> While machine learning models rapidly advance the state-of-the-art on various real-world tasks, out-of-domain (OOD) generalization remains a challenging problem given the vulnerability of these models to spurious correlations. We propose a balanced mini-batch sampling strategy to transform a biased data distribution into a spurious-free balanced distribution, based on the invariance of the underlying causal mechanisms for the data generation process. We argue that the Bayes optimal classifiers trained on such balanced distribution are minimax optimal across a diverse enough environment space. We also provide an identifiability guarantee of the latent variable model of the proposed data generation process, when utilizing enough train environments. Experiments are conducted on DomainBed, demonstrating empirically that our method obtains the best performance across 20 baselines reported on the benchmark.

> Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in learning and solving complex tasks in a variety of fields. Nevertheless, the rise of those networks in modern computing has been accompanied by concerns regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel gradient-free, gray box, incremental attack that targets the training process of neural networks. The proposed attack, which implicitly poisons the intermediate data structures that retain the training instances between training epochs acquires its high-risk property from attacking data structures that are typically unobserved by professionals. Hence, the attack goes unnoticed despite the damage it can cause. Moreover, the attack can be executed without the attackers' knowledge of the neural network structure or training data making it more dangerous. The attack was tested under a sensitive application of secure cognitive cities, namely, biometric authentication. The conducted experiments showed that the proposed attack is effective and stealthy. Finally, the attack effectiveness property was concluded from the fact that it was able to flip the sign of the loss gradient in the conducted experiments to become positive, which indicated noisy and unstable training. Moreover, the attack was able to decrease the inference probability in the poisoned networks compared to their unpoisoned counterparts by 15.37%, 14.68%, and 24.88% for the Densenet, VGG, and Xception, respectively. Finally, the attack retained its stealthiness despite its high effectiveness. This was demonstrated by the fact that the attack did not cause a notable increase in the training time, in addition, the Fscore values only dropped by an average of 1.2%, 1.9%, and 1.5% for the poisoned Densenet, VGG, and Xception, respectively.

> Economic issues, such as inflation, energy costs, taxes, and interest rates, are a constant presence in our daily lives and have been exacerbated by global events such as pandemics, environmental disasters, and wars. A sustained history of financial crises reveals significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the foundations of modern economies. Another significant issue currently is people quitting their jobs in large numbers. Moreover, many organizations have a diverse workforce comprising multiple generations posing new challenges. Transformative approaches in economics and labour markets are needed to protect our societies, economies, and planet. In this work, we use big data and machine learning methods to discover multi-perspective parameters for multi-generational labour markets. The parameters for the academic perspective are discovered using 35,000 article abstracts from the Web of Science for the period 1958-2022 and for the professionals' perspective using 57,000 LinkedIn posts from 2022. We discover a total of 28 parameters and categorised them into 5 macro-parameters, Learning & Skills, Employment Sectors, Consumer Industries, Learning & Employment Issues, and Generations-specific Issues. A complete machine learning software tool is developed for data-driven parameter discovery. A variety of quantitative and visualisation methods are applied and multiple taxonomies are extracted to explore multi-generational labour markets. A knowledge structure and literature review of multi-generational labour markets using over 100 research articles is provided. It is expected that this work will enhance the theory and practice of AI-based methods for knowledge discovery and system parameter discovery to develop autonomous capabilities and systems and promote novel approaches to labour economics and markets, leading to the development of sustainable societies and economies.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly benefited direction of arrival (DoA) estimation methods for speech source localization in noisy environments. However, their localization accuracy is still far from satisfactory due to the vulnerability to nonspeech interference. To improve the robustness against interference, we propose a DNN based normalized time-frequency (T-F) weighted criterion which minimizes the distance between the candidate steering vectors and the filtered snapshots in the T-F domain. Our method requires no eigendecomposition and uses a simple normalization to prevent the optimization objective from being misled by noisy filtered snapshots. We also study different designs of T-F weights guided by a DNN. We find that duplicating the Hadamard product of speech ratio masks is highly effective and better than other techniques such as direct masking and taking the mean in the proposed approach. However, the best-performing design of T-F weights is criterion-dependent in general. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms popular DNN based DoA estimation methods including widely used subspace methods in noisy and reverberant environments.

> Adversarial training is widely used to make classifiers robust to a specific threat or adversary, such as $\ell_p$-norm bounded perturbations of a given $p$-norm. However, existing methods for training classifiers robust to multiple threats require knowledge of all attacks during training and remain vulnerable to unseen distribution shifts. In this work, we describe how to obtain adversarially-robust model soups (i.e., linear combinations of parameters) that smoothly trade-off robustness to different $\ell_p$-norm bounded adversaries. We demonstrate that such soups allow us to control the type and level of robustness, and can achieve robustness to all threats without jointly training on all of them. In some cases, the resulting model soups are more robust to a given $\ell_p$-norm adversary than the constituent model specialized against that same adversary. Finally, we show that adversarially-robust model soups can be a viable tool to adapt to distribution shifts from a few examples.

> With the increase in cybersecurity vulnerabilities of software systems, the ways to exploit them are also increasing. Besides these, malware threats, irregular network interactions, and discussions about exploits in public forums are also on the rise. To identify these threats faster, to detect potentially relevant entities from any texts, and to be aware of software vulnerabilities, automated approaches are necessary. Application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in the Cybersecurity domain can help in achieving this. However, there are challenges such as the diverse nature of texts involved in the cybersecurity domain, the unavailability of large-scale publicly available datasets, and the significant cost of hiring subject matter experts for annotations. One of the solutions is building multi-task models that can be trained jointly with limited data. In this work, we introduce a generative multi-task model, Unified Text-to-Text Cybersecurity (UTS), trained on malware reports, phishing site URLs, programming code constructs, social media data, blogs, news articles, and public forum posts. We show UTS improves the performance of some cybersecurity datasets. We also show that with a few examples, UTS can be adapted to novel unseen tasks and the nature of data

> System call filtering is a widely used security mechanism for protecting a shared OS kernel against untrusted user applications. However, existing system call filtering techniques either are too expensive due to the context switch overhead imposed by userspace agents, or lack sufficient programmability to express advanced policies. Seccomp, Linux's system call filtering module, is widely used by modern container technologies, mobile apps, and system management services. Despite the adoption of the classic BPF language (cBPF), security policies in Seccomp are mostly limited to static allow lists, primarily because cBPF does not support stateful policies. Consequently, many essential security features cannot be expressed precisely and/or require kernel modifications.   In this paper, we present a programmable system call filtering mechanism, which enables more advanced security policies to be expressed by leveraging the extended BPF language (eBPF). More specifically, we create a new Seccomp eBPF program type, exposing, modifying or creating new eBPF helper functions to safely manage filter state, access kernel and user state, and utilize synchronization primitives. Importantly, our system integrates with existing kernel privilege and capability mechanisms, enabling unprivileged users to install advanced filters safely. Our evaluation shows that our eBPF-based filtering can enhance existing policies (e.g., reducing the attack surface of early execution phase by up to 55.4% for temporal specialization), mitigate real-world vulnerabilities, and accelerate filters.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that would trigger misclassification of DNNs but may be imperceptible to human perception. Adversarial defense has been an important way to improve the robustness of DNNs. Existing attack methods often construct adversarial examples relying on some metrics like the $\ell_p$ distance to perturb samples. However, these metrics can be insufficient to conduct adversarial attacks due to their limited perturbations. In this paper, we propose a new internal Wasserstein distance (IWD) to capture the semantic similarity of two samples, and thus it helps to obtain larger perturbations than currently used metrics such as the $\ell_p$ distance. We then apply the internal Wasserstein distance to perform adversarial attack and defense. In particular, we develop a novel attack method relying on IWD to calculate the similarities between an image and its adversarial examples. In this way, we can generate diverse and semantically similar adversarial examples that are more difficult to defend by existing defense methods. Moreover, we devise a new defense method relying on IWD to learn robust models against unseen adversarial examples. We provide both thorough theoretical and empirical evidence to support our methods.

> Distributed machine learning paradigms, such as federated learning, have been recently adopted in many privacy-critical applications for speech analysis. However, such frameworks are vulnerable to privacy leakage attacks from shared gradients. Despite extensive efforts in the image domain, the exploration of speech privacy leakage from gradients is quite limited. In this paper, we explore methods for recovering private speech/speaker information from the shared gradients in distributed learning settings. We conduct experiments on a keyword spotting model with two different types of speech features to quantify the amount of leaked information by measuring the similarity between the original and recovered speech signals. We further demonstrate the feasibility of inferring various levels of side-channel information, including speech content and speaker identity, under the distributed learning framework without accessing the user's data.

> Recently, ChatGPT has gained significant attention in research due to its ability to interact with humans effectively. The core idea behind this model is reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning, a new paradigm that allows language models to align with human preferences, i.e., InstructGPT. In this study, we propose BadGPT, the first backdoor attack against RL fine-tuning in language models. By injecting a backdoor into the reward model, the language model can be compromised during the fine-tuning stage. Our initial experiments on movie reviews, i.e., IMDB, demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the generated text through BadGPT.

> Blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology, becomes increasingly popular, especially for enabling valuable cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. However, the blockchain software systems inevitably have many bugs. Although bugs in smart contracts have been extensively investigated, security bugs of the underlying blockchain systems are much less explored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on blockchain's system vulnerabilities from four representative blockchains, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Stellar. Specifically, we first design a systematic filtering process to effectively identify 1,037 vulnerabilities and their 2,317 patches from 34,245 issues/PRs (pull requests) and 85,164 commits on GitHub. We thus build the first blockchain vulnerability dataset. We then perform unique analyses of this dataset at three levels, including (i) file-level vulnerable module categorization by identifying and correlating module paths across projects, (ii) text-level vulnerability type clustering by natural language processing and similarity-based sentence clustering, and (iii) code-level vulnerability pattern analysis by generating and clustering code change signatures that capture both syntactic and semantic information of patch code fragments. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (i) some blockchain modules are more susceptible than the others; notably, each of the modules related to consensus, wallet, and networking has over 200 issues; (ii) about 70% of blockchain vulnerabilities are of traditional types, but we also identify four new types specific to blockchains; and (iii) we obtain 21 blockchain-specific vulnerability patterns that capture unique blockchain attributes and statuses, and demonstrate that they can be used to detect similar vulnerabilities in other popular blockchains, such as Dogecoin, Bitcoin SV, and Zcash.

> Due to the open-source nature of the blockchain ecosystem, it is common for new blockchains to fork or partially reuse the code of classic blockchains. For example, the popular Dogecoin, Litecoin, Binance BSC, and Polygon are all variants of Bitcoin/Ethereum. These "forked" blockchains thus could encounter similar vulnerabilities that are propagated from Bitcoin/Ethereum during forking or subsequently commit fetching. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of detecting and investigating the propagated vulnerabilities in forked blockchain projects. To facilitate this study, we propose BlockScope, a novel tool that can effectively and efficiently detect multiple types of cloned vulnerabilities given an input of existing Bitcoin/Ethereum security patches. Specifically, BlockScope adopts similarity-based code match and designs a new way of calculating code similarity to cover all the syntax-wide variant (i.e., Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3) clones. Moreover, BlockScope automatically extracts and leverages the contexts of patch code to narrow down the search scope and locate only potentially relevant code for comparison. Our evaluation shows that BlockScope achieves good precision and high recall both at 91.8% (1.8 times higher recall than that in ReDeBug). BlockScope allows us to discover 101 previously unknown vulnerabilities in 13 out of the 16 forked projects of Bitcoin and Ethereum, including 16 from Dogecoin, 6 from Litecoin, 1 from Binance, and 4 from Optimism. We have reported all the vulnerabilities to their developers; 40 of them have been patched or accepted, 66 were acknowledged or under pending, and only 4 were rejected. We further investigate the propagation and patching processes of discovered vulnerabilities, and reveal three types of vulnerability propagation from source to forked projects, as well as the long delay (over 200 days) for releasing patches in Bitcoin forks.

> Trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) technology has revolutionized daily life and greatly benefited human society. Among various AI technologies, Federated Learning (FL) stands out as a promising solution for diverse real-world scenarios, ranging from risk evaluation systems in finance to cutting-edge technologies like drug discovery in life sciences. However, challenges around data isolation and privacy threaten the trustworthiness of FL systems. Adversarial attacks against data privacy, learning algorithm stability, and system confidentiality are particularly concerning in the context of distributed training in federated learning. Therefore, it is crucial to develop FL in a trustworthy manner, with a focus on security, robustness, and privacy. In this survey, we propose a comprehensive roadmap for developing trustworthy FL systems and summarize existing efforts from three key aspects: security, robustness, and privacy. We outline the threats that pose vulnerabilities to trustworthy federated learning across different stages of development, including data processing, model training, and deployment. To guide the selection of the most appropriate defense methods, we discuss specific technical solutions for realizing each aspect of Trustworthy FL (TFL). Our approach differs from previous work that primarily discusses TFL from a legal perspective or presents FL from a high-level, non-technical viewpoint.

> Autonomous cars are well known for being vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise the safety of the car and pose danger to other road users. To effectively defend against adversaries, it is required to not only test autonomous cars for finding driving errors but to improve the robustness of the cars to these errors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a two-step methodology for autonomous cars that consists of (i) finding failure states in autonomous cars by training the adversarial driving agent, and (ii) improving the robustness of autonomous cars by retraining them with effective adversarial inputs. Our methodology supports testing autonomous cars in a multi-agent environment, where we train and compare adversarial car policy on two custom reward functions to test the driving control decision of autonomous cars. We run experiments in a vision-based high-fidelity urban driving simulated environment. Our results show that adversarial testing can be used for finding erroneous autonomous driving behavior, followed by adversarial training for improving the robustness of deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous driving policies. We demonstrate that the autonomous cars retrained using the effective adversarial inputs noticeably increase the performance of their driving policies in terms of reduced collision and offroad steering errors.

> Recent developments to encrypt the Domain Name System (DNS) have resulted in major browser and operating system vendors deploying encrypted DNS functionality, often enabling various configurations and settings by default. In many cases, default encrypted DNS settings have implications for performance and privacy; for example, Firefox's default DNS setting sends all of a user's DNS queries to Cloudflare, potentially introducing new privacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we confirm that most users are unaware of these developments -- with respect to the rollout of these new technologies, the changes in default settings, and the ability to customize encrypted DNS configuration to balance user preferences between privacy and performance. Our findings suggest several important implications for the designers of interfaces for encrypted DNS functionality in both browsers and operating systems, to help improve user awareness concerning these settings, and to ensure that users retain the ability to make choices that allow them to balance tradeoffs concerning DNS privacy and performance.

> The microservice software architecture is more scalable and efficient than its monolithic predecessor. Despite its increasing adoption, microservices might expose security concerns and issues that are distinct from those associated with monolithic designs. We propose Microusity, a tool that performs RESTful API testing on a specific type of microservice pattern called back end for front end (BFF). We design a novel approach to trace BFF requests using the port mapping between requests to BFF and the sub-requests sent to back-end microservices. Furthermore, our tool can pinpoint which of the back end service causing the internal server error, which may lead to unhandled errors or vulnerabilities. Microusity provides an error report and a graph visualization that reveal the source of the error and supports developers in comprehension and debugging of the errors. The evaluation of eight software practitioners shows that Microusity and its security test reports are useful for investigating and understanding problems in BFF systems. The prototype tool and the video demo of the tool can be found at https://github.com/MUICT-SERU/MICROUSITY.

> Spectral clustering became a popular choice for data clustering for its ability of uncovering clusters of different shapes. However, it is not always preferable over other clustering methods due to its computational demands. One of the effective ways to bypass these computational demands is to perform spectral clustering on a subset of points (data representatives) then generalize the clustering outcome, this is known as approximate spectral clustering (ASC). ASC uses sampling or quantization to select data representatives. This makes it vulnerable to 1) performance inconsistency (since these methods have a random step either in initialization or training), 2) local statistics loss (because the pairwise similarities are extracted from data representatives instead of data points). We proposed a refined version of $k$-nearest neighbor graph, in which we keep data points and aggressively reduce number of edges for computational efficiency. Local statistics were exploited to keep the edges that do not violate the intra-cluster distances and nullify all other edges in the $k$-nearest neighbor graph. We also introduced an optional step to automatically select the number of clusters $C$. The proposed method was tested on synthetic and real datasets. Compared to ASC methods, the proposed method delivered a consistent performance despite significant reduction of edges.

> Recently, deep learning techniques have garnered substantial attention for their ability to identify vulnerable code patterns accurately. However, current state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) require substantial computational resources. This results in a level of overhead that makes their implementation unfeasible for deployment in realtime settings. This study presents a novel transformer-based vulnerability detection framework, referred to as VulDetect, which is achieved through the fine-tuning of a pre-trained large language model, (GPT) on various benchmark datasets of vulnerable code. Our empirical findings indicate that our framework is capable of identifying vulnerable software code with an accuracy of up to 92.65%. Our proposed technique outperforms SyseVR and VulDeBERT, two state-of-the-art vulnerability detection techniques

> Recent studies have shown that, like traditional machine learning, federated learning (FL) is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To improve the adversarial robustness of FL, federated adversarial training (FAT) methods have been proposed to apply adversarial training locally before global aggregation. Although these methods demonstrate promising results on independent identically distributed (IID) data, they suffer from training instability on non-IID data with label skewness, resulting in degraded natural accuracy. This tends to hinder the application of FAT in real-world applications where the label distribution across the clients is often skewed. In this paper, we study the problem of FAT under label skewness, and reveal one root cause of the training instability and natural accuracy degradation issues: skewed labels lead to non-identical class probabilities and heterogeneous local models. We then propose a Calibrated FAT (CalFAT) approach to tackle the instability issue by calibrating the logits adaptively to balance the classes. We show both theoretically and empirically that the optimization of CalFAT leads to homogeneous local models across the clients and better convergence points.

> Neural network implementations are known to be vulnerable to physical attack vectors such as fault injection attacks. As of now, these attacks were only utilized during the inference phase with the intention to cause a misclassification. In this work, we explore a novel attack paradigm by injecting faults during the training phase of a neural network in a way that the resulting network can be attacked during deployment without the necessity of further faulting. In particular, we discuss attacks against ReLU activation functions that make it possible to generate a family of malicious inputs, which are called fooling inputs, to be used at inference time to induce controlled misclassifications. Such malicious inputs are obtained by mathematically solving a system of linear equations that would cause a particular behaviour on the attacked activation functions, similar to the one induced in training through faulting. We call such attacks fooling backdoors as the fault attacks at the training phase inject backdoors into the network that allow an attacker to produce fooling inputs. We evaluate our approach against multi-layer perceptron networks and convolutional networks on a popular image classification task obtaining high attack success rates (from 60% to 100%) and high classification confidence when as little as 25 neurons are attacked while preserving high accuracy on the originally intended classification task.

> The rise of pre-trained unified foundation models breaks down the barriers between different modalities and tasks, providing comprehensive support to users with unified architectures. However, the backdoor attack on pre-trained models poses a serious threat to their security. Previous research on backdoor attacks has been limited to uni-modal tasks or single tasks across modalities, making it inapplicable to unified foundation models. In this paper, we make proof-of-concept level research on the backdoor attack for pre-trained unified foundation models. Through preliminary experiments on NLP and CV classification tasks, we reveal the vulnerability of these models and suggest future research directions for enhancing the attack approach.

> Deep neural network based speech enhancement approaches aim to learn a noisy-to-clean transformation using a supervised learning paradigm. However, such a trained-well transformation is vulnerable to unseen noises that are not included in training set. In this work, we focus on the unsupervised noise adaptation problem in speech enhancement, where the ground truth of target domain data is completely unavailable. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial network based method to efficiently learn a converse clean-to-noisy transformation using a few minutes of unpaired target domain data. Then this transformation is utilized to generate sufficient simulated data for domain adaptation of the enhancement model. Experimental results show that our method effectively mitigates the domain mismatch between training and test sets, and surpasses the best baseline by a large margin.

> Recently, bug-bounty programs have gained popularity and become a significant part of the security culture of many organizations. Bug-bounty programs enable organizations to enhance their security posture by harnessing the diverse expertise of crowds of external security experts (i.e., bug hunters). Nonetheless, quantifying the benefits of bug-bounty programs remains elusive, which presents a significant challenge for managing them. Previous studies focused on measuring their benefits in terms of the number of vulnerabilities reported or based on the properties of the reported vulnerabilities, such as severity or exploitability. However, beyond these inherent properties, the value of a report also depends on the probability that the vulnerability would be discovered by a threat actor before an internal expert could discover and patch it. In this paper, we present a data-driven study of the Chromium and Firefox vulnerability-reward programs. First, we estimate the difficulty of discovering a vulnerability using the probability of rediscovery as a novel metric. Our findings show that vulnerability discovery and patching provide clear benefits by making it difficult for threat actors to find vulnerabilities; however, we also identify opportunities for improvement, such as incentivizing bug hunters to focus more on development releases. Second, we compare the types of vulnerabilities that are discovered internally vs. externally and those that are exploited by threat actors. We observe significant differences between vulnerabilities found by external bug hunters, internal security teams, and external threat actors, which indicates that bug-bounty programs provide an important benefit by complementing the expertise of internal teams, but also that external hunters should be incentivized more to focus on the types of vulnerabilities that are likely to be exploited by threat actors.

> Fuzzing has gained in popularity for software vulnerability detection by virtue of the tremendous effort to develop a diverse set of fuzzers. Thanks to various fuzzing techniques, most of the fuzzers have been able to demonstrate great performance on their selected targets. However, paradoxically, this diversity in fuzzers also made it difficult to select fuzzers that are best suitable for complex real-world programs, which we call selection burden. Communities attempted to address this problem by creating a set of standard benchmarks to compare and contrast the performance of fuzzers for a wide range of applications, but the result was always a suboptimal decision - the best-performing fuzzer on average does not guarantee the best outcome for the target of a user's interest.   To overcome this problem, we propose an automated, yet non-intrusive meta-fuzzer, called autofz, to maximize the benefits of existing state-of-the-art fuzzers via dynamic composition. To an end user, this means that, instead of spending time on selecting which fuzzer to adopt, one can simply put all of the available fuzzers to autofz, and achieve the best, optimal result. The key idea is to monitor the runtime progress of the fuzzers, called trends (similar in concept to gradient descent), and make a fine-grained adjustment of resource allocation. This is a stark contrast to existing approaches - autofz deduces a suitable set of fuzzers of the active workload in a fine-grained manner at runtime. Our evaluation shows that autofz outperforms any best-performing individual fuzzers in 11 out of 12 available benchmarks and beats the best, collaborative fuzzing approaches in 19 out of 20 benchmarks. Moreover, on average, autofz found 152% more bugs than individual fuzzers, and 415% more bugs than collaborative fuzzing.

> In this paper, we address the problem of designing incentive mechanisms by a virtual service provider (VSP) to hire sensing IoT devices to sell their sensing data to help creating and rendering the digital copy of the physical world in the Metaverse. Due to the limited bandwidth, we propose to use semantic extraction algorithms to reduce the delivered data by the sensing IoT devices. Nevertheless, mechanisms to hire sensing IoT devices to share their data with the VSP and then deliver the constructed digital twin to the Metaverse users are vulnerable to adverse selection problem. The adverse selection problem, which is caused by information asymmetry between the system entities, becomes harder to solve when the private information of the different entities are multi-dimensional. We propose a novel iterative contract design and use a new variant of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve the modelled multi-dimensional contract problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct extensive simulations and measure several key performance metrics of the contract for the Metaverse. Our results show that our designed iterative contract is able to incentivize the participants to interact truthfully, which maximizes the profit of the VSP with minimal individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) violation rates. Furthermore, the proposed learning-based iterative contract framework has limited access to the private information of the participants, which is to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind in addressing the problem of adverse selection in incentive mechanisms.

> In this paper, we study the security posture of the EV charging ecosystem against a new type of remote that exploits vulnerabilities in the EV charging mobile applications as an attack surface. We leverage a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to analyze the security of widely used EV charging mobile applications. Our analysis was performed on 31 of the most widely used mobile applications including their interactions with various components such as cloud management systems. The attack, scenarios that exploit these vulnerabilities were verified on a real-time co-simulation test bed. Our discoveries indicate the lack of user/vehicle verification and improper authorization for critical functions, which allow adversaries to remotely hijack charging sessions and launch attacks against the connected critical infrastructure. The attacks were demonstrated using the EVCS mobile applications showing the feasibility and the applicability of our attacks. Indeed, we discuss specific remote attack scenarios and their impact on EV users. More importantly, our analysis results demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging existing vulnerabilities across various EV charging mobile applications to perform wide-scale coordinated remote charging/discharging attacks against the connected critical infrastructure (e.g., power grid), with significant economical and operational implications. Finally, we propose countermeasures to secure the infrastructure and impede adversaries from performing reconnaissance and launching remote attacks using compromised accounts.

- `2302.13520v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13520v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13520v1)

> Bit-flip attacks (BFAs) have attracted substantial attention recently, in which an adversary could tamper with a small number of model parameter bits to break the integrity of DNNs. To mitigate such threats, a batch of defense methods are proposed, focusing on the untargeted scenarios. Unfortunately, they either require extra trustworthy applications or make models more vulnerable to targeted BFAs. Countermeasures against targeted BFAs, stealthier and more purposeful by nature, are far from well established.   In this work, we propose Aegis, a novel defense method to mitigate targeted BFAs. The core observation is that existing targeted attacks focus on flipping critical bits in certain important layers. Thus, we design a dynamic-exit mechanism to attach extra internal classifiers (ICs) to hidden layers. This mechanism enables input samples to early-exit from different layers, which effectively upsets the adversary's attack plans. Moreover, the dynamic-exit mechanism randomly selects ICs for predictions during each inference to significantly increase the attack cost for the adaptive attacks where all defense mechanisms are transparent to the adversary. We further propose a robustness training strategy to adapt ICs to the attack scenarios by simulating BFAs during the IC training phase, to increase model robustness. Extensive evaluations over four well-known datasets and two popular DNN structures reveal that Aegis could effectively mitigate different state-of-the-art targeted attacks, reducing attack success rate by 5-10$\times$, significantly outperforming existing defense methods.

> Social Engineering has emerged as a significant threat in cyber security. In a dialog based attack, by having enough of a potential victim's personal data to be convincing, a social engineer impersonates the victim in order to manipulate the attack's target into revealing sufficient information for accessing the victim's accounts etc. We utilise the developing understanding of human information processing in the Information Sciences to characterise the vulnerability of the target to manipulation and to propose a form of countermeasure. Our focus is on the possibility of the social engineer being able to build the victim's profile by, in part, inferring personal attribute values from statistical information available either informally, from general knowledge, or, more formally, from some public database. We use an orthogonalised log linear analysis of data in the form of a contingence table to develop a measure of how susceptible particular subtables are to probabilistic inference as the basis for our proposed countermeasure. This is based on the observation that inference relies on a high degree of non-uniformity and exploits the orthogonality of the analysis to define the measure in terms of subspace projections.

> Deep reinforcement learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can decrease a victim's cumulative expected reward by manipulating the victim's observations. Despite the efficiency of previous optimization-based methods for generating adversarial noise in supervised learning, such methods might not be able to achieve the lowest cumulative reward since they do not explore the environmental dynamics in general. In this paper, we provide a framework to better understand the existing methods by reformulating the problem of adversarial attacks on reinforcement learning in the function space. Our reformulation generates an optimal adversary in the function space of the targeted attacks, repelling them via a generic two-stage framework. In the first stage, we train a deceptive policy by hacking the environment, and discover a set of trajectories routing to the lowest reward or the worst-case performance. Next, the adversary misleads the victim to imitate the deceptive policy by perturbing the observations. Compared to existing approaches, we theoretically show that our adversary is stronger under an appropriate noise level. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, achieving the state-of-the-art performance in both Atari and MuJoCo environments.

> Today, creators of data-hungry deep neural networks (DNNs) scour the Internet for training fodder, leaving users with little control over or knowledge of when their data is appropriated for model training. To empower users to counteract unwanted data use, we design, implement and evaluate a practical system that enables users to detect if their data was used to train an DNN model. We show how users can create special data points we call isotopes, which introduce "spurious features" into DNNs during training. With only query access to a trained model and no knowledge of the model training process, or control of the data labels, a user can apply statistical hypothesis testing to detect if a model has learned the spurious features associated with their isotopes by training on the user's data. This effectively turns DNNs' vulnerability to memorization and spurious correlations into a tool for data provenance. Our results confirm efficacy in multiple settings, detecting and distinguishing between hundreds of isotopes with high accuracy. We further show that our system works on public ML-as-a-service platforms and larger models such as ImageNet, can use physical objects instead of digital marks, and remains generally robust against several adaptive countermeasures.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI Codex are increasingly being used as AI-based coding assistants. Understanding the impact of these tools on developers' code is paramount, especially as recent work showed that LLMs may suggest cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We conduct a security-driven user study (N=58) to assess code written by student programmers when assisted by LLMs. Given the potential severity of low-level bugs as well as their relative frequency in real-world projects, we tasked participants with implementing a singly-linked 'shopping list' structure in C. Our results indicate that the security impact in this setting (low-level C with pointer and array manipulations) is small: AI-assisted users produce critical security bugs at a rate no greater than 10% more than the control, indicating the use of LLMs does not introduce new security risks.

> Android's filesystem access control is a crucial aspect of its system integrity. It utilizes a combination of mandatory access controls, such as SELinux, and discretionary access controls, like Unix permissions, along with specialized access controls such as Android permissions to safeguard OEM and Android services from third-party applications. However, when OEMs introduce differentiating features, they often create vulnerabilities due to their inability to properly reconfigure this complex policy combination. To address this, we introduce the POLYSCOPE tool, which triages Android filesystem access control policies to identify attack operations - authorized operations that may be exploited by adversaries to elevate their privileges. POLYSCOPE has three significant advantages over prior analyses: it allows for the independent extension and analysis of individual policy models, understands the flexibility untrusted parties have in modifying access control policies, and can identify attack operations that system configurations permit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POLYSCOPE by examining the impact of Scoped Storage on Android, revealing that it reduces the number of attack operations possible on external storage resources by over 50%. However, because OEMs only partially adopt Scoped Storage, we also uncover two previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating how POLYSCOPE can assess an ideal scenario where all apps comply with Scoped Storage, which can reduce the number of untrusted parties accessing attack operations by over 65% on OEM systems. POLYSCOPE thus helps Android OEMs evaluate complex access control policies to pinpoint the attack operations that require further examination.

> Bug localization is an important aspect of software maintenance because it can locate modules that need to be changed to fix a specific bug. Although method-level bug localization is helpful for developers, there are only a few tools and techniques for this task; moreover, there is no large-scale framework for their evaluation. In this paper, we present FinerBench4BL, an evaluation framework for method-level information retrieval-based bug localization techniques, and a comparative study using this framework. This framework was semi-automatically constructed from Bench4BL, a file-level bug localization evaluation framework, using a repository transformation approach. We converted the original file-level version repositories provided by Bench4BL into method-level repositories by repository transformation. Method-level data components such as oracle methods can also be automatically derived by applying the oracle generation approach via bug-commit linking in Bench4BL to the generated method repositories. Furthermore, we tailored existing file-level bug localization technique implementations at the method level. We created a framework for method-level evaluation by merging the generated dataset and implementations. The comparison results show that the method-level techniques decreased accuracy whereas improved debugging efficiency compared to file-level techniques.

> Neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable against fault injection attacks. These attacks change the physical behavior of the device during the computation, resulting in a change of value that is currently being computed. They can be realized by various fault injection techniques, ranging from clock/voltage glitching to application of lasers to rowhammer. In this paper we explore the possibility to reverse engineer neural networks with the usage of fault attacks. SNIFF stands for sign bit flip fault, which enables the reverse engineering by changing the sign of intermediate values. We develop the first exact extraction method on deep-layer feature extractor networks that provably allows the recovery of the model parameters. Our experiments with Keras library show that the precision error for the parameter recovery for the tested networks is less than $10^{-13}$ with the usage of 64-bit floats, which improves the current state of the art by 6 orders of magnitude. Additionally, we discuss the protection techniques against fault injection attacks that can be applied to enhance the fault resistance.

> Recent deep-learning-based compression methods have achieved superior performance compared with traditional approaches. However, deep learning models have proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where some specific trigger patterns added to the input can lead to malicious behavior of the models. In this paper, we present a novel backdoor attack with multiple triggers against learned image compression models. Motivated by the widely used discrete cosine transform (DCT) in existing compression systems and standards, we propose a frequency-based trigger injection model that adds triggers in the DCT domain. In particular, we design several attack objectives for various attacking scenarios, including: 1) attacking compression quality in terms of bit-rate and reconstruction quality; 2) attacking task-driven measures, such as down-stream face recognition and semantic segmentation. Moreover, a novel simple dynamic loss is designed to balance the influence of different loss terms adaptively, which helps achieve more efficient training. Extensive experiments show that with our trained trigger injection models and simple modification of encoder parameters (of the compression model), the proposed attack can successfully inject several backdoors with corresponding triggers in a single image compression model.

> Proof-of-Location (PoL) is a lightweight security concept for Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, focusing on the sensor nodes as the least performant and most vulnerable parts of IoT networks. PoL builds on the identification of network participants based on their physical location. It introduces a secondary message type to exchange location information. Via these messages, the nodes can verify the integrity of other network participants and reach a consensus to identify potential attackers and prevent malicious information from spreading. The paper presents the concretization of the concept to allow implementation on real hardware. The evaluation based on this implementation demonstrates the feasibility of PoL and enables identifying further steps to develop a deployable protocol.

> Single-shot auctions are commonly used as a means to sell goods, for example when selling ad space or allocating radio frequencies, however devising mechanisms for auctions with multiple bidders and multiple items can be complicated. It has been shown that neural networks can be used to approximate optimal mechanisms while satisfying the constraints that an auction be strategyproof and individually rational. We show that despite such auctions maximizing revenue, they do so at the cost of revealing private bidder information. While randomness is often used to build in privacy, in this context it comes with complications if done without care. Specifically, it can violate rationality and feasibility constraints, fundamentally change the incentive structure of the mechanism, and/or harm top-level metrics such as revenue and social welfare. We propose a method that employs stochasticity to improve privacy while meeting the requirements for auction mechanisms with only a modest sacrifice in revenue. We analyze the cost to the auction house that comes with introducing varying degrees of privacy in common auction settings. Our results show that despite current neural auctions' ability to approximate optimal mechanisms, the resulting vulnerability that comes with relying on neural networks must be accounted for.

> What would the inputs be to a machine whose output is the destabilization of a robust democracy, or whose emanations could disrupt the political power of nations? In the recent essay "The Coming AI Hackers," Schneier (2021) proposed a future application of artificial intelligences to discover, manipulate, and exploit vulnerabilities of social, economic, and political systems at speeds far greater than humans' ability to recognize and respond to such threats. This work advances the concept by applying to it theory from machine learning, hypothesizing some possible "featurization" (input specification and transformation) frameworks for AI hacking. Focusing on the political domain, we develop graph and sequence data representations that would enable the application of a range of deep learning models to predict attributes and outcomes of political, particularly legislative, systems. We explore possible data models, datasets, predictive tasks, and actionable applications associated with each framework. We speculate about the likely practical impact and feasibility of such models, and conclude by discussing their ethical implications.

> Graph attention networks estimate the relational importance of node neighbors to aggregate relevant information over local neighborhoods for a prediction task. However, the inferred attentions are vulnerable to spurious correlations and connectivity in the training data, hampering the generalizability of the model. We introduce CAR, a general-purpose regularization framework for graph attention networks. Embodying a causal inference approach, CAR aligns the attention mechanism with the causal effects of active interventions on graph connectivity in a scalable manner. CAR is compatible with a variety of graph attention architectures, and we show that it systematically improves generalizability on various node classification tasks. Our ablation studies indicate that CAR hones in on the aspects of graph structure most pertinent to the prediction (e.g., homophily), and does so more effectively than alternative approaches. Finally, we also show that CAR enhances interpretability of attention weights by accentuating node-neighbor relations that point to causal hypotheses. For social media network-sized graphs, a CAR-guided graph rewiring approach could allow us to combine the scalability of graph convolutional methods with the higher performance of graph attention.

> Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the fastest emerging networking paradigms enabling a large number of applications for the benefit of mankind. Advancements in embedded system technology and compressed IPv6 have enabled the support of IP stack in resource constrained heterogeneous smart devices. However, global connectivity and resource constrained characteristics of smart devices have exposed them to different insider and outsider attacks, which put users' security and privacy at risk. Various risks associated with IoT slow down its growth and become an obstruction in the worldwide adoption of its applications. In RFC 6550, the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Network (RPL) is specified by IETF's ROLL working group for facilitating efficient routing in 6LoWPAN networks, while considering its limitations. Due to resource constrained nature of nodes in the IoT, RPL is vulnerable to many attacks that consume the node's resources and degrade the network's performance. In this paper, we present a study on various attacks and their existing defense solutions, particularly to RPL. Open research issues, challenges, and future directions specific to RPL security are also discussed. A taxonomy of RPL attacks, considering the essential attributes like resources, topology, and traffic, is shown for better understanding. In addition, a study of existing cross-layered and RPL specific network layer based defense solutions suggested in the literature is also carried out.

> Software bugs pose an ever-present concern for developers, and patching such bugs requires a considerable amount of costs through complex operations. In contrast, introducing bugs can be an effortless job, in that even a simple mutation can easily break the Program Under Test (PUT). Existing research has considered these two opposed activities largely separately, either trying to automatically generate realistic patches to help developers, or to find realistic bugs to simulate and prevent future defects. Despite the fundamental differences between them, however, we hypothesise that they do not syntactically differ from each other when considered simply as code changes. To examine this assumption systematically, we investigate the relationship between patches and buggy commits, both generated manually and automatically, using a clustering and pattern analysis. A large scale empirical evaluation reveals that up to 70% of patches and faults can be clustered together based on the similarity between their lexical patterns; further, 44% of the code changes can be abstracted into the identical change patterns. Moreover, we investigate whether code mutation tools can be used as Automated Program Repair (APR) tools, and APR tools as code mutation tools. In both cases, the inverted use of mutation and APR tools can perform surprisingly well, or even better, when compared to their original, intended uses. For example, 89% of patches found by SequenceR, a deep learning based APR tool, can also be found by its inversion, i.e., a model trained with faults and not patches. Similarly, real fault coupling study of mutants reveals that TBar, a template based APR tool, can generate 14% and 3% more fault couplings than traditional mutation tools, PIT and Major respectively, when used as a mutation tool.

> Despite the tremendous progress made by deep learning models in image semantic segmentation, they typically require large annotated examples, and increasing attention is being diverted to problem settings like Few-Shot Learning (FSL) where only a small amount of annotation is needed for generalisation to novel classes. This is especially seen in medical domains where dense pixel-level annotations are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose Regularized Prototypical Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (R-PNODE), a method that leverages intrinsic properties of Neural-ODEs, assisted and enhanced by additional cluster and consistency losses to perform Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) of organs. R-PNODE constrains support and query features from the same classes to lie closer in the representation space thereby improving the performance over the existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based FSS methods. We further demonstrate that while many existing Deep CNN based methods tend to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks, R-PNODE exhibits increased adversarial robustness for a wide array of these attacks. We experiment with three publicly available multi-organ segmentation datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain FSS settings to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. In addition, we perform experiments with seven commonly used adversarial attacks in various settings to demonstrate R-PNODE's robustness. R-PNODE outperforms the baselines for FSS by significant margins and also shows superior performance for a wide array of attacks varying in intensity and design.

> Model attribution is a critical component of deep neural networks (DNNs) for its interpretability to complex models. Recent studies bring up attention to the security of attribution methods as they are vulnerable to attribution attacks that generate similar images with dramatically different attributions. Existing works have been investigating empirically improving the robustness of DNNs against those attacks; however, none of them explicitly quantifies the actual deviations of attributions. In this work, for the first time, a constrained optimization problem is formulated to derive an upper bound that measures the largest dissimilarity of attributions after the samples are perturbed by any noises within a certain region while the classification results remain the same. Based on the formulation, different practical approaches are introduced to bound the attributions above using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity under both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$-norm perturbations constraints. The bounds developed by our theoretical study are validated on various datasets and two different types of attacks (PGD attack and IFIA attribution attack). Over 10 million attacks in the experiments indicate that the proposed upper bounds effectively quantify the robustness of models based on the worst-case attribution dissimilarities.

> Machine Learning (ML)-powered apps are used in pervasive devices such as phones, tablets, smartwatches and IoT devices. Recent advances in collaborative, distributed ML such as Federated Learning (FL) attempt to solve privacy concerns of users and data owners, and thus used by tech industry leaders such as Google, Facebook and Apple. However, FL systems and models are still vulnerable to adversarial membership and attribute inferences and model poisoning attacks, especially in FL-as-a-Service ecosystems recently proposed, which can enable attackers to access multiple ML-powered apps. In this work, we focus on the recently proposed Sponge attack: It is designed to soak up energy consumed while executing inference (not training) of ML model, without hampering the classifier's performance. Recent work has shown sponge attacks on ASCI-enabled GPUs can potentially escalate the power consumption and inference time. For the first time, in this work, we investigate this attack in the mobile setting and measure the effect it can have on ML models running inside apps on mobile devices.

> Trusted execution environments (TEEs) provide an environment for running workloads in the cloud without having to trust cloud service providers, by offering additional hardware-assisted security guarantees. However, main memory encryption as a key mechanism to protect against system-level attackers trying to read the TEE's content and physical, off-chip attackers, is insufficient. The recent Cipherleaks attacks infer secret data from TEE-protected implementations by analyzing ciphertext patterns exhibited due to deterministic memory encryption. The underlying vulnerability, dubbed the ciphertext side-channel, is neither protected by state-of-the-art countermeasures like constant-time code nor by hardware fixes.   Thus, in this paper, we present a software-based, drop-in solution that can harden existing binaries such that they can be safely executed under TEEs vulnerable to ciphertext side-channels, without requiring recompilation. We combine taint tracking with both static and dynamic binary instrumentation to find sensitive memory locations, and mitigate the leakage by masking secret data before it gets written to memory. This way, although the memory encryption remains deterministic, we destroy any secret-dependent patterns in encrypted memory. We show that our proof-of-concept implementation protects various constant-time implementations against ciphertext side-channels with reasonable overhead.

> Currently used digital signatures based on asymmetric cryptography will be vulnerable to quantum computers running Shor's algorithm. In this work, we propose a new quantum-assisted digital signature protocol based on symmetric keys generated by QKD, that allows signing and verifying messages in a simple way implementing an integration of currently available classical and quantum technologies. The protocol is described for a three-user scenario composed of one sender and two receivers. In contrast to previous schemes, it is independent of the message length. The security of the protocol has been analyzed, as well as its integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation properties.

> Social media studies often collect data retrospectively to analyze public opinion. Social media data may decay over time and such decay may prevent the collection of the complete dataset. As a result, the collected dataset may differ from the complete dataset and the study may suffer from data persistence bias. Past research suggests that the datasets collected retrospectively are largely representative of the original dataset in terms of textual content. However, no study analyzed the impact of data persistence bias on social media studies such as those focusing on controversial topics. In this study, we analyze the data persistence and the bias it introduces on the datasets of three types: controversial topics, trending topics, and framing of issues. We report which topics are more likely to suffer from data persistence among these datasets. We quantify the data persistence bias using the change in political orientation, the presence of potentially harmful content and topics as measures. We found that controversial datasets are more likely to suffer from data persistence and they lean towards the political left upon recollection. The turnout of the data that contain potentially harmful content is significantly lower on non-controversial datasets. Overall, we found that the topics promoted by right-aligned users are more likely to suffer from data persistence. Account suspensions are the primary factor contributing to data removals, if not the only one. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for the data persistence bias by collecting the data in real time when the dataset employed is vulnerable to data persistence bias.

> IoT devices are known to be vulnerable to various cyber-attacks, such as data exfiltration and the execution of flooding attacks as part of a DDoS attack. When it comes to detecting such attacks using network traffic analysis, it has been shown that some attack scenarios are not always equally easy to detect if they involve different IoT models. That is, when targeted at some IoT models, a given attack can be detected rather accurately, while when targeted at others the same attack may result in too many false alarms. In this research, we attempt to explain this variability of IoT attack detectability and devise a risk assessment method capable of addressing a key question: how easy is it for an anomaly-based network intrusion detection system to detect a given cyber-attack involving a specific IoT model? In the process of addressing this question we (a) investigate the predictability of IoT network traffic, (b) present a novel taxonomy for IoT attack detection which also encapsulates traffic predictability aspects, (c) propose an expert-based attack detectability estimation method which uses this taxonomy to derive a detectability score (termed `D-Score') for a given combination of IoT model and attack scenario, and (d) empirically evaluate our method while comparing it with a data-driven method.

- `2303.01052v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01052v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01052v1)

> The origin of adversarial examples is still inexplicable in research fields, and it arouses arguments from various viewpoints, albeit comprehensive investigations. In this paper, we propose a way of delving into the unexpected vulnerability in adversarially trained networks from a causal perspective, namely adversarial instrumental variable (IV) regression. By deploying it, we estimate the causal relation of adversarial prediction under an unbiased environment dissociated from unknown confounders. Our approach aims to demystify inherent causal features on adversarial examples by leveraging a zero-sum optimization game between a casual feature estimator (i.e., hypothesis model) and worst-case counterfactuals (i.e., test function) disturbing to find causal features. Through extensive analyses, we demonstrate that the estimated causal features are highly related to the correct prediction for adversarial robustness, and the counterfactuals exhibit extreme features significantly deviating from the correct prediction. In addition, we present how to effectively inoculate CAusal FEatures (CAFE) into defense networks for improving adversarial robustness.

> Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems are used in various applications. However, it has been shown that they are vulnerable to very small perturbations of their inputs, known as adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a new targeted adversarial attack against NMT models. In particular, our goal is to insert a predefined target keyword into the translation of the adversarial sentence while maintaining similarity between the original sentence and the perturbed one in the source domain. To this aim, we propose an optimization problem, including an adversarial loss term and a similarity term. We use gradient projection in the embedding space to craft an adversarial sentence. Experimental results show that our attack outperforms Seq2Sick, the other targeted adversarial attack against NMT models, in terms of success rate and decrease in translation quality. Our attack succeeds in inserting a keyword into the translation for more than 75% of sentences while similarity with the original sentence stays preserved.

> Robotic Vehicles (RVs) have gained great popularity over the past few years. Meanwhile, they are also demonstrated to be vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks. Although a wealth of research works have presented various attacks, some key questions remain unanswered: are these existing works complete enough to cover all the sensor spoofing threats? If not, how many attacks are not explored, and how difficult is it to realize them? This paper answers the above questions by comprehensively systematizing the knowledge of sensor spoofing attacks against RVs. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We identify seven common attack paths in an RV system pipeline. We categorize and assess existing spoofing attacks from the perspectives of spoofer property, operation, victim characteristic and attack goal. Based on this systematization, we identify 4 interesting insights about spoofing attack designs. (2) We propose a novel action flow model to systematically describe robotic function executions and unexplored sensor spoofing threats. With this model, we successfully discover 103 spoofing attack vectors, 26 of which have been verified by prior works, while 77 attacks are never considered. (3) We design two novel attack methodologies to verify the feasibility of newly discovered spoofing attack vectors.

> Simulation-based inference (SBI) is rapidly establishing itself as a standard machine learning technique for analyzing data in cosmological surveys. Despite continual improvements to the quality of density estimation by learned models, applications of such techniques to real data are entirely reliant on the generalization power of neural networks far outside the training distribution, which is mostly unconstrained. Due to the imperfections in scientist-created simulations, and the large computational expense of generating all possible parameter combinations, SBI methods in cosmology are vulnerable to such generalization issues. Here, we discuss the effects of both issues, and show how using a Bayesian neural network framework for training SBI can mitigate biases, and result in more reliable inference outside the training set. We introduce cosmoSWAG, the first application of Stochastic Weight Averaging to cosmology, and apply it to SBI trained for inference on the cosmic microwave background.

> Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables energy-efficient communication between numerous components in System-on-Chip architectures. The optical NoC is widely considered a key technology to overcome the bandwidth and energy limitations of traditional electrical on-chip interconnects. While optical NoC can offer high performance, they come with inherent security vulnerabilities due to the nature of optical interconnects.   In this paper, we investigate the gain competition attack in optical NoCs, which can be initiated by an attacker injecting a high-power signal to the optical waveguide, robbing the legitimate signals of amplification. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first attempt to investigate gain competition attacks as a security threat in optical NoCs. We model the attack and analyze its effects on optical NoC performance. We also propose potential attack detection techniques and countermeasures to mitigate the attack. Our experimental evaluation using different NoC topologies and diverse traffic patterns demonstrates the effectiveness of our modeling and exploration of gain competition attacks in optical NoC architectures.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial images, while their robustness in text classification is rarely studied. Several lines of text attack methods have been proposed in the literature, including character-level, word-level, and sentence-level attacks. However, it is still a challenge to minimize the number of word changes necessary to induce misclassification, while simultaneously ensuring lexical correctness, syntactic soundness, and semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose a Bigram and Unigram based adaptive Semantic Preservation Optimization (BU-SPO) method to examine the vulnerability of deep models. Our method has four major merits. Firstly, we propose to attack text documents not only at the unigram word level but also at the bigram level which better keeps semantics and avoids producing meaningless outputs. Secondly, we propose a hybrid method to replace the input words with options among both their synonyms candidates and sememe candidates, which greatly enriches the potential substitutions compared to only using synonyms. Thirdly, we design an optimization algorithm, i.e., Semantic Preservation Optimization (SPO), to determine the priority of word replacements, aiming to reduce the modification cost. Finally, we further improve the SPO with a semantic Filter (named SPOF) to find the adversarial example with the highest semantic similarity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our BU-SPO and BU-SPOF on IMDB, AG's News, and Yahoo! Answers text datasets by attacking four popular DNNs models. Results show that our methods achieve the highest attack success rates and semantics rates by changing the smallest number of words compared with existing methods.

> Point cloud classification is an essential component in many security-critical applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to adversarially perturbed point clouds. Existing certified defenses against adversarial point clouds suffer from a key limitation: their certified robustness guarantees are probabilistic, i.e., they produce an incorrect certified robustness guarantee with some probability. In this work, we propose a general framework, namely PointCert, that can transform an arbitrary point cloud classifier to be certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees. PointCert certifiably predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modified points is less than a threshold. Moreover, we propose multiple methods to optimize the certified robustness guarantees of PointCert in three application scenarios. We systematically evaluate PointCert on ModelNet and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets. Our results show that PointCert substantially outperforms state-of-the-art certified defenses even though their robustness guarantees are probabilistic.

> Web services use server-side input sanitization to guard against harmful input. Some web services publish their sanitization logic to make their client interface more usable, e.g., allowing clients to debug invalid requests locally. However, this usability practice poses a security risk. Specifically, services may share the regexes they use to sanitize input strings -- and regex-based denial of service (ReDoS) is an emerging threat. Although prominent service outages caused by ReDoS have spurred interest in this topic, we know little about the degree to which live web services are vulnerable to ReDoS.   In this paper, we conduct the first black-box study measuring the extent of ReDoS vulnerabilities in live web services. We apply the Consistent Sanitization Assumption: that client-side sanitization logic, including regexes, is consistent with the sanitization logic on the server-side. We identify a service's regex-based input sanitization in its HTML forms or its API, find vulnerable regexes among these regexes, craft ReDoS probes, and pinpoint vulnerabilities. We analyzed the HTML forms of 1,000 services and the APIs of 475 services. Of these, 355 services publish regexes; 17 services publish unsafe regexes; and 6 services are vulnerable to ReDoS through their APIs (6 domains; 15 subdomains). Both Microsoft and Amazon Web Services patched their web services as a result of our disclosure. Since these vulnerabilities were from API specifications, not HTML forms, we proposed a ReDoS defense for a popular API validation library, and our patch has been merged. To summarize: in client-visible sanitization logic, some web services advertise ReDoS vulnerabilities in plain sight. Our results motivate short-term patches and long-term fundamental solutions.

> Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning (ML) approach that allows the use of distributed data without compromising personal privacy. However, the heterogeneous distribution of data among clients in FL can make it difficult for the orchestration server to validate the integrity of local model updates, making FL vulnerable to various threats, including backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks involve the insertion of malicious functionality into a targeted model through poisoned updates from malicious clients. These attacks can cause the global model to misbehave on specific inputs while appearing normal in other cases. Backdoor attacks have received significant attention in the literature due to their potential to impact real-world deep learning applications. However, they have not been thoroughly studied in the context of FL. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive survey of current backdoor attack strategies and defenses in FL, including a comprehensive analysis of different approaches. We also discuss the challenges and potential future directions for attacks and defenses in the context of FL.

> Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly being integrated into embedded and IoT systems that surround us, and they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The deployment of these ML algorithms on resource-limited embedded platforms also requires the use of model compression techniques. The impact of such model compression techniques on adversarial robustness in ML is an important and emerging area of research. This article provides an overview of the landscape of adversarial attacks and ML model compression techniques relevant to embedded systems. We then describe efforts that seek to understand the relationship between adversarial attacks and ML model compression before discussing open problems in this area.

In this paper, we investigate the robustness of Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) ensembles through architectural improvements and ensemble diversity promotion. We perform a comprehensive robustness assessment against adaptive attacks and investigate the relationship between ensemble diversity and robustness. Our results demonstrate the benefits of ECOC ensembles for adversarial robustness compared to regular ensembles of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and show why the robustness of previous implementations is limited. We also propose an adversarial training method specific to ECOC ensembles that allows to further improve robustness to adaptive attacks.

> Image classification has been one of the most popular tasks in Deep Learning, seeing an abundance of impressive implementations each year. However, there is a lot of criticism tied to promoting complex architectures that continuously push performance metrics higher and higher. Robustness tests can uncover several vulnerabilities and biases which go unnoticed during the typical model evaluation stage. So far, model robustness under distribution shifts has mainly been examined within carefully curated datasets. Nevertheless, such approaches do not test the real response of classifiers in the wild, e.g. when uncurated web-crawled image data of corresponding classes are provided. In our work, we perform fine-grained classification on closely related categories, which are identified with the help of hierarchical knowledge. Extensive experimentation on a variety of convolutional and transformer-based architectures reveals model robustness in this novel setting. Finally, hierarchical knowledge is again employed to evaluate and explain misclassifications, providing an information-rich evaluation scheme adaptable to any classifier.

> O-RAN is a new, open, adaptive, and intelligent RAN architecture. Motivated by the success of artificial intelligence in other domains, O-RAN strives to leverage machine learning (ML) to automatically and efficiently manage network resources in diverse use cases such as traffic steering, quality of experience prediction, and anomaly detection. Unfortunately, it has been shown that ML-based systems are vulnerable to an attack technique referred to as adversarial machine learning (AML). This special kind of attack has already been demonstrated in recent studies and in multiple domains. In this paper, we present a systematic AML threat analysis for O-RAN. We start by reviewing relevant ML use cases and analyzing the different ML workflow deployment scenarios in O-RAN. Then, we define the threat model, identifying potential adversaries, enumerating their adversarial capabilities, and analyzing their main goals. Next, we explore the various AML threats associated with O-RAN and review a large number of attacks that can be performed to realize these threats and demonstrate an AML attack on a traffic steering model. In addition, we analyze and propose various AML countermeasures for mitigating the identified threats. Finally, based on the identified AML threats and countermeasures, we present a methodology and a tool for performing risk assessment for AML attacks for a specific ML use case in O-RAN.

- `2303.02545v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02545v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02545v1)

> In recent years, REST API fuzzing has emerged to explore errors on a cloud service. Its performance highly depends on the sequence construction and request generation. However, existing REST API fuzzers have trouble generating long sequences with well-constructed requests to trigger hard-to-reach states in a cloud service, which limits their performance of finding deep errors and security bugs. Further, they cannot find the specific errors caused by using undefined parameters during request generation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid data-driven solution, named MINER, with three new designs working together to address the above limitations. First, MINER collects the valid sequences whose requests pass the cloud service's checking as the templates, and assigns more executions to long sequence templates. Second, to improve the generation quality of requests in a sequence template, MINER creatively leverages the state-of-the-art neural network model to predict key request parameters and provide them with appropriate parameter values. Third, MINER implements a new data-driven security rule checker to capture the new kind of errors caused by undefined parameters. We evaluate MINER against the state-of-the-art fuzzer RESTler on GitLab, Bugzilla, and WordPress via 11 REST APIs. The results demonstrate that the average pass rate of MINER is 23.42% higher than RESTler. MINER finds 97.54% more unique errors than RESTler on average and 142.86% more reproducible errors after manual analysis. We have reported all the newly found errors, and 7 of them have been confirmed as logic bugs by the corresponding vendors.

> Carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF), also known as CRLF injection is a type of vulnerability that allows a hacker to enter special characters into a web application, altering its operation or confusing the administrator. Log poisoning and HTTP response splitting are two prominent harmful uses of this technique. Additionally, CRLF injection can be used by an attacker to exploit other vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). According to Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), CRLF vulnerabilities are among the top 10 vulnerabilities and are a type of injection attack. Automated testing can help to quickly identify CRLF vulnerabilities, and is particularly useful for companies to test their applications before releasing them. However, CRLF vulnerabilities foster a better approach to mitigate CRLF vulnerabilities in the early stage and help secure applications against high-risk known vulnerabilities. There has been less research on CRLF vulnerabilities and how to detect them with automated testing. There is room for further research to be done on this subject matter in order to develop creative solutions to problems. It will also help to reduce false positive alerts by checking the header response of each request. Security automation is an important issue for companies trying to protect themselves against security threats. Automated alerts from security systems can provide a quicker and more accurate understanding of potential vulnerabilities and can help to reduce false positive alerts. Despite the extensive research on various types of vulnerabilities in web applications, CRLF vulnerabilities have only recently been included in the research. Utilizing automated testing as a recurring task can assist companies in receiving consistent updates about their systems and enhance their security.

> Recent works have shown that deep learning (DL) models can effectively learn city-wide crowd-flow patterns, which can be used for more effective urban planning and smart city management. However, DL models have been known to perform poorly on inconspicuous adversarial perturbations. Although many works have studied these adversarial perturbations in general, the adversarial vulnerabilities of deep crowd-flow prediction models in particular have remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform a rigorous analysis of the adversarial vulnerabilities of DL-based crowd-flow prediction models under multiple threat settings, making three-fold contributions. (1) We propose CaV-detect by formally identifying two novel properties - Consistency and Validity - of the crowd-flow prediction inputs that enable the detection of standard adversarial inputs with 0% false acceptance rate (FAR). (2) We leverage universal adversarial perturbations and an adaptive adversarial loss to present adaptive adversarial attacks to evade CaV-detect defense. (3) We propose CVPR, a Consistent, Valid and Physically-Realizable adversarial attack, that explicitly inducts the consistency and validity priors in the perturbation generation mechanism. We find out that although the crowd-flow models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, it is extremely challenging to simulate these perturbations in physical settings, notably when CaV-detect is in place. We also show that CVPR attack considerably outperforms the adaptively modified standard attacks in FAR and adversarial loss metrics. We conclude with useful insights emerging from our work and highlight promising future research directions.

> Deep learning frameworks (DLFs) have been playing an increasingly important role in this intelligence age since they act as a basic infrastructure for an increasingly wide range of AIbased applications. Meanwhile, as multi-programming-language (MPL) software systems, DLFs are inevitably suffering from bugs caused by the use of multiple programming languages (PLs). Hence, it is of paramount significance to understand the bugs (especially the bugs involving multiple PLs, i.e., MPL bugs) of DLFs, which can provide a foundation for preventing, detecting, and resolving bugs in the development of DLFs. To this end, we manually analyzed 1497 bugs in three MPL DLFs, namely MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. First, we classified bugs in these DLFs into 12 types (e.g., algorithm design bugs and memory bugs) according to their bug labels and characteristics. Second, we further explored the impacts of different bug types on the development of DLFs, and found that deployment bugs and memory bugs negatively impact the development of DLFs in different aspects the most. Third, we found that 28.6%, 31.4%, and 16.0% of bugs in MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow are MPL bugs, respectively; the PL combination of Python and C/C++ is most used in fixing more than 92% MPL bugs in all DLFs. Finally, the code change complexity of MPL bug fixes is significantly greater than that of single-programming-language (SPL) bug fixes in all the three DLFs, while in PyTorch MPL bug fixes have longer open time and greater communication complexity than SPL bug fixes. These results provide insights for bug management in DLFs.

> Our goal is to improve reliability of Machine Learning (ML) systems deployed in the wild. ML models perform exceedingly well when test examples are similar to train examples. However, real-world applications are required to perform on any distribution of test examples. Current ML systems can fail silently on test examples with distribution shifts. In order to improve reliability of ML models due to covariate or domain shift, we propose algorithms that enable models to: (a) generalize to a larger family of test distributions, (b) evaluate accuracy under distribution shifts, (c) adapt to a target distribution. We study causes of impaired robustness to domain shifts and present algorithms for training domain robust models. A key source of model brittleness is due to domain overfitting, which our new training algorithms suppress and instead encourage domain-general hypotheses. While we improve robustness over standard training methods for certain problem settings, performance of ML systems can still vary drastically with domain shifts. It is crucial for developers and stakeholders to understand model vulnerabilities and operational ranges of input, which could be assessed on the fly during the deployment, albeit at a great cost. Instead, we advocate for proactively estimating accuracy surfaces over any combination of prespecified and interpretable domain shifts for performance forecasting. We present a label-efficient estimation to address estimation over a combinatorial space of domain shifts. Further, when a model's performance on a target domain is found to be poor, traditional approaches adapt the model using the target domain's resources. Standard adaptation methods assume access to sufficient labeled resources, which may be impractical for deployed models. We initiate a study of lightweight adaptation techniques with only unlabeled data resources with a focus on language applications.

> Adversarial attacks on a convolutional neural network (CNN) -- injecting human-imperceptible perturbations into an input image -- could fool a high-performance CNN into making incorrect predictions. The success of adversarial attacks raises serious concerns about the robustness of CNNs, and prevents them from being used in safety-critical applications, such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. Our work introduces a visual analytics approach to understanding adversarial attacks by answering two questions: (1) which neurons are more vulnerable to attacks and (2) which image features do these vulnerable neurons capture during the prediction? For the first question, we introduce multiple perturbation-based measures to break down the attacking magnitude into individual CNN neurons and rank the neurons by their vulnerability levels. For the second, we identify image features (e.g., cat ears) that highly stimulate a user-selected neuron to augment and validate the neuron's responsibility. Furthermore, we support an interactive exploration of a large number of neurons by aiding with hierarchical clustering based on the neurons' roles in the prediction. To this end, a visual analytics system is designed to incorporate visual reasoning for interpreting adversarial attacks. We validate the effectiveness of our system through multiple case studies as well as feedback from domain experts.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Recent studies about adversarial robustness focus on the loss landscape in the parameter space since it is related to optimization and generalization performance. These studies conclude that the difficulty of adversarial training is caused by the non-smoothness of the loss function: i.e., its gradient is not Lipschitz continuous. However, this analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial attacks on model parameters. Since adversarial attacks are optimized for models, they should depend on the parameters. Considering this dependence, we analyze the smoothness of the loss function of adversarial training using the optimal attacks for the model parameter in more detail. We reveal that the constraint of adversarial attacks is one cause of the non-smoothness and that the smoothness depends on the types of the constraints. Specifically, the $L_\infty$ constraint can cause non-smoothness more than the $L_2$ constraint. Moreover, our analysis implies that if we flatten the loss function with respect to input data, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of adversarial loss tends to increase. To address the non-smoothness, we show that EntropySGD smoothens the non-smooth loss and improves the performance of adversarial training.

> The rapid development of Artificial IntelligenceGenerated Content (AIGC) has brought daunting challenges regarding service latency, security, and trustworthiness. Recently, researchers presented the edge AIGC paradigm, effectively optimize the service latency by distributing AIGC services to edge devices. However, AIGC products are still unprotected and vulnerable to tampering and plagiarization. Moreover, as a kind of online non-fungible digital property, the free circulation of AIGC products is hindered by the lack of trustworthiness in open networks. In this article, for the first time, we present a blockchain-empowered framework to manage the lifecycle of edge AIGC products. Specifically, leveraging fraud proof, we first propose a protocol to protect the ownership and copyright of AIGC, called Proof-of-AIGC. Then, we design an incentive mechanism to guarantee the legitimate and timely executions of the funds-AIGC ownership exchanges among anonymous users. Furthermore, we build a multi-weight subjective logic-based reputation scheme, with which AIGC producers can determine which edge service provider is trustworthy and reliable to handle their services. Through numerical results, the superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated. Last but not least, we discuss important open directions for further research.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The backdoor adversaries intend to maliciously control the predictions of attacked DNNs by injecting hidden backdoors that can be activated by adversary-specified trigger patterns during the training process. One recent research revealed that most of the existing attacks failed in the real physical world since the trigger contained in the digitized test samples may be different from that of the one used for training. Accordingly, users can adopt spatial transformations as the image pre-processing to deactivate hidden backdoors. In this paper, we explore the previous findings from another side. We exploit classical spatial transformations (i.e. rotation and translation) with the specific parameter as trigger patterns to design a simple yet effective poisoning-based backdoor attack. For example, only images rotated to a particular angle can activate the embedded backdoor of attacked DNNs. Extensive experiments are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our attack under both digital and physical settings and its resistance to existing backdoor defenses.

> Recent studies have demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks during the training process. Specifically, the adversaries intend to embed hidden backdoors in DNNs so that malicious model predictions can be activated through pre-defined trigger patterns. In this paper, we explore the backdoor mechanism from the angle of the model structure. We select the skip connection for discussions, inspired by the understanding that it helps the learning of model `shortcuts' where backdoor triggers are usually easier to be learned. Specifically, we demonstrate that the attack success rate (ASR) decreases significantly when reducing the outputs of some key skip connections. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective backdoor removal method by suppressing the skip connections in critical layers selected by our method. We also implement fine-tuning on these layers to recover high benign accuracy and to further reduce ASR. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method.

> Automatic vulnerability detection on C/C++ source code has benefitted from the introduction of machine learning to the field, with many recent publications targeting this combination. In contrast, assembly language or machine code artifacts receive less attention, although there are compelling reasons to study them. They are more representative of what is executed, more easily incorporated in dynamic analysis, and in the case of closed-source code, there is no alternative.   We evaluate the representative capability of assembly language compared to C/C++ source code for vulnerability detection. Furthermore, we investigate the role of call graph context in detecting function-spanning vulnerabilities. Finally, we verify whether compiling a benchmark dataset compromises an experiment's soundness by inadvertently leaking label information.   We propose ROMEO, a publicly available, reproducible and reusable binary vulnerability detection benchmark dataset derived from the synthetic Juliet test suite. Alongside, we introduce a simple text-based assembly language representation that includes context for function-spanning vulnerability detection and semantics to detect high-level vulnerabilities. It is constructed by disassembling the .text segment of the respective binaries.   We evaluate an x86 assembly language representation of the compiled dataset, combined with an off-the-shelf classifier. It compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods, including those operating on the full C/C++ code. Including context information using the call graph improves detection of function-spanning vulnerabilities. There is no label information leaked during the compilation process.

> Despite the rapid growth of smart contracts, they are suffering numerous security vulnerabilities due to the absence of reliable development and testing. In this article, we apply the metamorphic testing technique to detect smart contract vulnerabilities. Based on the anomalies we observed in vulnerable smart contracts, we define five metamorphic relations to detect abnormal gas consumption and account interaction inconsistency of the target smart contract. Through dynamically executing transactions and checking the final violation of metamorphic relations, we determine whether a smart contract is vulnerable. We evaluate our approach on a benchmark of 67 manually annotated smart contracts. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a higher detection rate (TPR, true positive rate) with a lower misreport rate (FDR, false discovery rate) than the other three state-of-the-art tools. These results further suggest that metamorphic testing is a promising method for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities.

> Under stringent model type and variable distribution assumptions, differentiable score-based causal discovery methods learn a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data by evaluating candidate graphs over an average score function. Despite great success in low-dimensional linear systems, it has been observed that these approaches overly exploit easier-to-fit samples, thus inevitably learning spurious edges. Worse still, inherent mostly in these methods the common homogeneity assumption can be easily violated, due to the widespread existence of heterogeneous data in the real world, resulting in performance vulnerability when noise distributions vary. We propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic framework to boost causal discovery performance by dynamically learning the adaptive weights for the Reweighted Score function, ReScore for short, where the weights tailor quantitatively to the importance degree of each sample. Intuitively, we leverage the bilevel optimization scheme to \wx{alternately train a standard DAG learner and reweight samples -- that is, upweight the samples the learner fails to fit and downweight the samples that the learner easily extracts the spurious information from. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are carried out to validate the effectiveness of ReScore. We observe consistent and significant boosts in structure learning performance. Furthermore, we visualize that ReScore concurrently mitigates the influence of spurious edges and generalizes to heterogeneous data. Finally, we perform the theoretical analysis to guarantee the structure identifiability and the weight adaptive properties of ReScore in linear systems. Our codes are available at https://github.com/anzhang314/ReScore.

> Designers use third-party intellectual property (IP) cores and outsource various steps in the integrated circuit (IC) design and manufacturing flow. As a result, security vulnerabilities have been rising. This is forcing IC designers and end users to re-evaluate their trust in ICs. If attackers get hold of an unprotected IC, they can reverse engineer the IC and pirate the IP. Similarly, if attackers get hold of a design, they can insert malicious circuits or take advantage of "backdoors" in a design. Unintended design bugs can also result in security weaknesses.   This tutorial paper provides an introduction to the domain of hardware security through two pedagogical examples of hardware security problems. The first is a walk-through of the scan chain-based side channel attack. The second is a walk-through of logic locking of digital designs. The tutorial material is accompanied by open access digital resources that are linked in this article.

> The increasing connectivity and intricate remote access environment have made traditional perimeter-based network defense vulnerable. Zero trust becomes a promising approach to provide defense policies based on agent-centric trust evaluation. However, the limited observations of the agent's trace bring information asymmetry in the decision-making. To facilitate the human understanding of the policy and the technology adoption, one needs to create a zero-trust defense that is explainable to humans and adaptable to different attack scenarios. To this end, we propose a scenario-agnostic zero-trust defense based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) and first-order Meta-Learning using only a handful of sample scenarios. The framework leads to an explainable and generalizable trust-threshold defense policy. To address the distribution shift between empirical security datasets and reality, we extend the model to a robust zero-trust defense minimizing the worst-case loss. We use case studies and real-world attacks to corroborate the results.

> Oracle-less machine learning (ML) attacks have broken various logic locking schemes. Regular synthesis, which is tailored for area-power-delay optimization, yields netlists where key-gate localities are vulnerable to learning. Thus, we call for security-aware logic synthesis. We propose ALMOST, a framework for adversarial learning to mitigate oracle-less ML attacks via synthesis tuning. ALMOST uses a simulated-annealing-based synthesis recipe generator, employing adversarially trained models that can predict state-of-the-art attacks' accuracies over wide ranges of recipes and key-gate localities. Experiments on ISCAS benchmarks confirm the attacks' accuracies drops to around 50\% for ALMOST-synthesized circuits, all while not undermining design optimization.

> Machine learning (ML)-based methods have recently become attractive for detecting security vulnerability exploits. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art ML models like long short-term memories (LSTMs) and transformers incur significant computation overheads. This overhead makes it infeasible to deploy them in real-time environments. We propose a novel ML-based exploit detection model, ML-FEED, that enables highly efficient inference without sacrificing performance. We develop a novel automated technique to extract vulnerability patterns from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases. This feature enables ML-FEED to be aware of the latest cyber weaknesses. Second, it is not based on the traditional approach of classifying sequences of application programming interface (API) calls into exploit categories. Such traditional methods that process entire sequences incur huge computational overheads. Instead, ML-FEED operates at a finer granularity and predicts the exploits triggered by every API call of the program trace. Then, it uses a state table to update the states of these potential exploits and track the progress of potential exploit chains. ML-FEED also employs a feature engineering approach that uses natural language processing-based word embeddings, frequency vectors, and one-hot encoding to detect semantically-similar instruction calls. Then, it updates the states of the predicted exploit categories and triggers an alarm when a vulnerability fingerprint executes. Our experiments show that ML-FEED is 72.9x and 75,828.9x faster than state-of-the-art lightweight LSTM and transformer models, respectively. We trained and tested ML-FEED on 79 real-world exploit categories. It predicts categories of exploit in real-time with 98.2% precision, 97.4% recall, and 97.8% F1 score. These results also outperform the LSTM and transformer baselines.

> Detecting bugs in Deep Learning (DL) libraries (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch) is critical for almost all downstream DL systems in ensuring effectiveness/safety for end users. Meanwhile, traditional fuzzing techniques can be hardly effective for such a challenging domain since the input DL programs need to satisfy both the input language (e.g., Python) syntax/semantics and the DL API input/shape constraints for tensor computations.   To address these limitations, we propose TitanFuzz - the first approach to directly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate input programs for fuzzing DL libraries. LLMs are titanic models trained on billions of code snippets and can auto-regressively generate human-like code snippets. Our key insight is that modern LLMs can also include numerous code snippets invoking DL library APIs in their training corpora, and thus can implicitly learn both language syntax/semantics and intricate DL API constraints for valid DL program generation. More specifically, we use both generative and infilling LLMs (e.g., Codex/InCoder) to generate and mutate valid/diverse input DL programs for fuzzing. Our experimental results demonstrate that TitanFuzz can achieve 30.38%/50.84% higher code coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers on TensorFlow/PyTorch. Furthermore, TitanFuzz is able to detect 65 bugs, with 41 already confirmed as previously unknown bugs.   This paper demonstrates that modern titanic LLMs can be leveraged to directly perform both generation-based and mutation-based fuzzing studied for decades, while being fully automated, generalizable, and applicable to domains challenging for traditional approaches (such as DL systems). We hope TitanFuzz can stimulate more work in this promising direction of LLMs for fuzzing.

> Due to the diversity of attack materials, fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) are vulnerable to malicious attacks. It is thus important to propose effective fingerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for the safety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods often exhibit poor robustness under new attack types settings. This paper thus proposes a novel channel-wise feature denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by handling the redundant noise information ignored in previous studies. The proposed method learns important features of fingerprint images by weighing the importance of each channel and identifying discriminative channels and "noise" channels. Then, the propagation of "noise" channels is suppressed in the feature map to reduce interference. Specifically, a PA-Adaptation loss is designed to constrain the feature distribution to make the feature distribution of live fingerprints more aggregate and that of spoof fingerprints more disperse. Experimental results evaluated on the LivDet 2017 dataset showed that the proposed CFD-PAD can achieve a 2.53% average classification error (ACE) and a 93.83% true detection rate when the false detection rate equals 1.0% (TDR@FDR=1%). Also, the proposed method markedly outperforms the best single-model-based methods in terms of ACE (2.53% vs. 4.56%) and TDR@FDR=1%(93.83% vs. 73.32%), which demonstrates its effectiveness. Although we have achieved a comparable result with the state-of-the-art multiple-model-based methods, there still is an increase in TDR@FDR=1% from 91.19% to 93.83%. In addition, the proposed model is simpler, lighter and more efficient and has achieved a 74.76% reduction in computation time compared with the state-of-the-art multiple-model-based method.

> Certification through auditing allows to ensure that critical embedded systems are secure. This entails reviewing their critical components and checking for dangerous execution paths. This latter task requires the use of specialized tools which allow to explore and replay executions but are also difficult to use effectively within the context of the audit, where time and knowledge of the code are limited. Fault analysis is especially tricky as the attacker may actively influence execution, rendering some common methods unusable and increasing the number of possible execution paths exponentially. In this work, we present a new method which mitigates these issues by reducing the number of fault injection points considered to only the most relevant ones relatively to some security properties. We use fast and robust static analysis to detect injection points and assert their impactfulness. A more precise dynamic/symbolic method is then employed to validate attack paths. This way the insight required to find attacks is reduced and dynamic methods can better scale to realistically sized programs. Our method is implemented into a toolchain based on Frama-C and KLEE and validated on WooKey, a case-study proposed by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France.

> GitHub introduced "Actions" in 2019 to increase workflow velocity and add customized automation to the repositories. Any individual can develop Actions for automating workflow on GitHub repositories and others can reuse them whenever open source. GitHub introduced its marketplace for commercializing and sharing these automation tools, which currently hosts 16,730 Actions. Yet, there are numerous Actions that are developed and distributed in local repositories and outside the Marketplace. So far, the research community conducted mining studies to understand Actions with a significant focus on CI/CD. We conducted a survey study with 90 Action developers and users to understand the motivations and best practices in using, developing, and debugging Actions, and the challenges associated with these tasks. We found that developers prefer Actions with verified creators and more stars when choosing between similar Actions, and often switch to an alternative Action when facing bugs or a lack of documentation. 60.87% of the developers consider the composition of YAML files, which are essential for Action integration, challenging and error-prone. They mainly check Q\&A forums to fix issues with these YAML files. Finally, developers tend to avoid using Actions (and hence automation) to reduce complexity, and security risk, or when the benefits of Actions are not worth the cost/effort of setting up Actions for automation.

> Lifelong learning (LL) aims to improve a predictive model as the data source evolves continuously. Most work in this learning paradigm has focused on resolving the problem of 'catastrophic forgetting,' which refers to a notorious dilemma between improving model accuracy over new data and retaining accuracy over previous data. Yet, it is also known that machine learning (ML) models can be vulnerable in the sense that tiny, adversarial input perturbations can deceive the models into producing erroneous predictions. This motivates the research objective of this paper - specification of a new LL framework that can salvage model robustness (against adversarial attacks) from catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we propose a new memory-replay LL strategy that leverages modern bi-level optimization techniques to determine the 'coreset' of the current data (i.e., a small amount of data to be memorized) for ease of preserving adversarial robustness over time. We term the resulting LL framework 'Data-Efficient Robustness-Preserving LL' (DERPLL). The effectiveness of DERPLL is evaluated for class-incremental image classification using ResNet-18 over the CIFAR-10 dataset. Experimental results show that DERPLL outperforms the conventional coreset-guided LL baseline and achieves a substantial improvement in both standard accuracy and robust accuracy.

> Blockchain has recently been depicted as a secure protocol for information exchange in cyber-physical microgrids. However, it is still found vulnerable to consensus manipulation attacks. These stealth attacks are often difficult to detect as they use kernel-level access to mask their actions. In this paper, we firstly build a trusted and secured peer-to-peer network mechanism for physical DC microgrids' validation of transactions over Distributed Ledger. Secondly, we leverage from a physics-informed approach for detecting malware-infected nodes and then recovering from stealth attacks using a self-healing recovery scheme augmented into the microgrid Blockchain network. This scheme allows compromised nodes to adapt to a reconstructed trustworthy signal in a multi-hop manner using corresponding measurements from the reliable nodes in the network. Additionally, recognizing the possible threat of denial-of-service attacks and random time delays (where information sharing via communication channels is blocked), we also integrate a model-free predictive controller with the proposed system that can locally reconstruct an expected version of the attacked/delayed signals. This supplements the capabilities of Blockchain, enabling it to detect and mitigate consensus manipulation attempts, and network latencies.

> Although researchers have characterized the bug-bounty ecosystem from the point of view of platforms and programs, minimal effort has been made to understand the perspectives of the main workers: bug hunters. To improve bug bounties, it is important to understand hunters' motivating factors, challenges, and overall benefits. We address this research gap with three studies: identifying key factors through a free listing survey (n=56), rating each factor's importance with a larger-scale factor-rating survey (n=159), and conducting semi-structured interviews to uncover details (n=24). Of 54 factors that bug hunters listed, we find that rewards and learning opportunities are the most important benefits. Further, we find scope to be the top differentiator between programs. Surprisingly, we find earning reputation to be one of the least important motivators for hunters. Of the challenges we identify, communication problems, such as unresponsiveness and disputes, are the most substantial. We present recommendations to make the bug-bounty ecosystem accommodating to more bug hunters and ultimately increase participation in an underutilized market.

> Security testing aims at verifying that the software meets its security properties. In modern Web systems, however, this often entails the verification of the outputs generated when exercising the system with a very large set of inputs. Full automation is thus required to lower costs and increase the effectiveness of security testing. Unfortunately, to achieve such automation, in addition to strategies for automatically deriving test inputs, we need to address the oracle problem, which refers to the challenge, given an input for a system, of distinguishing correct from incorrect behavior. In this paper, we propose Metamorphic Security Testing for Web-interactions (MST-wi), a metamorphic testing approach that integrates test input generation strategies inspired by mutational fuzzing and alleviates the oracle problem in security testing. It enables engineers to specify metamorphic relations (MRs) that capture many security properties of Web systems. To facilitate the specification of such MRs, we provide a domain-specific language accompanied by an Eclipse editor. MST-wi automatically collects the input data and transforms the MRs into executable Java code to automatically perform security testing. It automatically tests Web systems to detect vulnerabilities based on the relations and collected data. We provide a catalog of 76 system-agnostic MRs to automate security testing in Web systems. It covers 39% of the OWASP security testing activities not automated by state-of-the-art techniques; further, our MRs can automatically discover 102 different types of vulnerabilities, which correspond to 45% of the vulnerabilities due to violations of security design principles according to the MITRE CWE database. We also define guidelines that enable test engineers to improve the testability of the system under test with respect to our approach.

> With the increasing release of powerful language models trained on large code corpus (e.g. CodeBERT was trained on 6.4 million programs), a new family of mutation testing tools has arisen with the promise to generate more "natural" mutants in the sense that the mutated code aims at following the implicit rules and coding conventions typically produced by programmers. In this paper, we study to what extent the mutants produced by language models can semantically mimic the observable behavior of security-related vulnerabilities (a.k.a. Vulnerability-mimicking Mutants), so that designing test cases that are failed by these mutants will help in tackling mimicked vulnerabilities. Since analyzing and running mutants is computationally expensive, it is important to prioritize those mutants that are more likely to be vulnerability mimicking prior to any analysis or test execution. Taking this into account, we introduce VMMS, a machine learning based approach that automatically extracts the features from mutants and predicts the ones that mimic vulnerabilities. We conducted our experiments on a dataset of 45 vulnerabilities and found that 16.6% of the mutants fail one or more tests that are failed by 88.9% of the respective vulnerabilities. More precisely, 3.9% of the mutants from the entire mutant set are vulnerability-mimicking mutants that mimic 55.6% of the vulnerabilities. Despite the scarcity, VMMS predicts vulnerability-mimicking mutants with 0.63 MCC, 0.80 Precision, and 0.51 Recall, demonstrating that the features of vulnerability-mimicking mutants can be automatically learned by machine learning models to statically predict these without the need of investing effort in defining such features.

> Large-scale training of modern deep learning models heavily relies on publicly available data on the web. This potentially unauthorized usage of online data leads to concerns regarding data privacy. Recent works aim to make unlearnable data for deep learning models by adding small, specially designed noises to tackle this issue. However, these methods are vulnerable to adversarial training (AT) and/or are computationally heavy. In this work, we propose a novel, model-free, Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) generation technique. CUDA is generated using controlled class-wise convolutions with filters that are randomly generated via a private key. CUDA encourages the network to learn the relation between filters and labels rather than informative features for classifying the clean data. We develop some theoretical analysis demonstrating that CUDA can successfully poison Gaussian mixture data by reducing the clean data performance of the optimal Bayes classifier. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of CUDA with various datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), and architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-16, Wide ResNet-34-10, DenseNet-121, DeIT, EfficientNetV2-S, and MobileNetV2). Our experiments show that CUDA is robust to various data augmentations and training approaches such as smoothing, AT with different budgets, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. For instance, training a ResNet-18 on ImageNet-100 CUDA achieves only 8.96$\%$, 40.08$\%$, and 20.58$\%$ clean test accuracies with empirical risk minimization (ERM), $L_{\infty}$ AT, and $L_{2}$ AT, respectively. Here, ERM on the clean training data achieves a clean test accuracy of 80.66$\%$. CUDA exhibits unlearnability effect with ERM even when only a fraction of the training dataset is perturbed. Furthermore, we also show that CUDA is robust to adaptive defenses designed specifically to break it.

> Meta reinforcement learning (meta RL), as a combination of meta-learning ideas and reinforcement learning (RL), enables the agent to adapt to different tasks using a few samples. However, this sampling-based adaptation also makes meta RL vulnerable to adversarial attacks. By manipulating the reward feedback from sampling processes in meta RL, an attacker can mislead the agent into building wrong knowledge from training experience, which deteriorates the agent's performance when dealing with different tasks after adaptation. This paper provides a game-theoretical underpinning for understanding this type of security risk. In particular, we formally define the sampling attack model as a Stackelberg game between the attacker and the agent, which yields a minimax formulation. It leads to two online attack schemes: Intermittent Attack and Persistent Attack, which enable the attacker to learn an optimal sampling attack, defined by an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point, within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. These attack schemes freeride the learning progress concurrently without extra interactions with the environment. By corroborating the convergence results with numerical experiments, we observe that a minor effort of the attacker can significantly deteriorate the learning performance, and the minimax approach can also help robustify the meta RL algorithms.

> Deep Learning (DL) is being applied in various domains, especially in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Consequently, it is of great significance to ensure the robustness of these methods and thus counteract uncertain behaviors caused by adversarial attacks. In this paper, we use gradient heatmaps to analyze the response characteristics of the VGG-16 model when the input images are mixed with adversarial noise and statistically similar Gaussian random noise. In particular, we compare the network response layer by layer to determine where errors occurred. Several interesting findings are derived. First, compared to Gaussian random noise, intentionally generated adversarial noise causes severe behavior deviation by distracting the area of concentration in the networks. Second, in many cases, adversarial examples only need to compromise a few intermediate blocks to mislead the final decision. Third, our experiments revealed that specific blocks are more vulnerable and easier to exploit by adversarial examples. Finally, we demonstrate that the layers $Block4\_conv1$ and $Block5\_cov1$ of the VGG-16 model are more susceptible to adversarial attacks. Our work could provide valuable insights into developing more reliable Deep Neural Network (DNN) models.

> With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its ``event-triggered" mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the vulnerability detection of smart contracts. Compared with the traditional approaches, it can get good results with fewer layers of the GCN model, which shows that the contract bytecode and GCN model are efficient in vulnerability detection.

> We present a new type of attack in which source code is maliciously encoded so that it appears different to a compiler and to the human eye. This attack exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers. 'Trojan Source' attacks, as we call them, pose an immediate threat both to first-party software and of supply-chain compromise across the industry. We present working examples of Trojan Source attacks in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, Python, SQL, Bash, Assembly, and Solidity. We propose definitive compiler-level defenses, and describe other mitigating controls that can be deployed in editors, repositories, and build pipelines while compilers are upgraded to block this attack. We document an industry-wide coordinated disclosure for these vulnerabilities; as they affect most compilers, editors, and repositories, the exercise teaches how different firms, open-source communities, and other stakeholders respond to vulnerability disclosure.

> Natural language processing models based on neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. These adversarial examples are imperceptible to human readers but can mislead models to make the wrong predictions. In a black-box setting, attacker can fool the model without knowing model's parameters and architecture. Previous works on word-level attacks widely use single semantic space and greedy search as a search strategy. However, these methods fail to balance the attack success rate, quality of adversarial examples and time consumption. In this paper, we propose BeamAttack, a textual attack algorithm that makes use of mixed semantic spaces and improved beam search to craft high-quality adversarial examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BeamAttack can improve attack success rate while saving numerous queries and time, e.g., improving at most 7\% attack success rate than greedy search when attacking the examples from MR dataset. Compared with heuristic search, BeamAttack can save at most 85\% model queries and achieve a competitive attack success rate. The adversarial examples crafted by BeamAttack are highly transferable and can effectively improve model's robustness during adversarial training.

> Semantic parsing is a technique aimed at constructing a structured representation of the meaning of a natural-language question. Recent advancements in few-shot language models trained on code have demonstrated superior performance in generating these representations compared to traditional unimodal language models, which are trained on downstream tasks. Despite these advancements, existing fine-tuned neural semantic parsers are susceptible to adversarial attacks on natural-language inputs. While it has been established that the robustness of smaller semantic parsers can be enhanced through adversarial training, this approach is not feasible for large language models in real-world scenarios, as it requires both substantial computational resources and expensive human annotation on in-domain semantic parsing data. This paper presents the first empirical study on the adversarial robustness of a large prompt-based language model of code, \codex. Our results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) code-language models are vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial examples. To address this challenge, we propose methods for improving robustness without the need for significant amounts of labeled data or heavy computational resources.

> Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) are a novel neural architecture, built around initial value problems with learned dynamics which are solved during inference. Thought to be inherently more robust against adversarial perturbations, they were recently shown to be vulnerable to strong adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for formal guarantees. However, despite significant progress in robustness verification for standard feed-forward architectures, the verification of high dimensional NODEs remains an open problem. In this work, we address this challenge and propose GAINS, an analysis framework for NODEs combining three key ideas: (i) a novel class of ODE solvers, based on variable but discrete time steps, (ii) an efficient graph representation of solver trajectories, and (iii) a novel abstraction algorithm operating on this graph representation. Together, these advances enable the efficient analysis and certified training of high-dimensional NODEs, by reducing the runtime from an intractable $O(\exp(d)+\exp(T))$ to ${O}(d+T^2 \log^2T)$ in the dimensionality $d$ and integration time $T$. In an extensive evaluation on computer vision (MNIST and FMNIST) and time-series forecasting (PHYSIO-NET) problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both our certified training and verification methods.

Given the widespread use of knowledge distillation, in this work we seek to exploit the unlabelled data knowledge distillation process to embed Trojans in a student model without introducing conspicuous behavior in the teacher. We ultimately devise a Trojan attack that effectively reduces student accuracy, does not alter teacher performance, and is efficiently constructible in practice.

> Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used in various domains. However, adversarial attacks can easily mislead a neural network and lead to wrong decisions. Defense mechanisms are highly preferred in safety-critical applications. In this paper, firstly, we use the gradient class activation map (GradCAM) to analyze the behavior deviation of the VGG-16 network when its inputs are mixed with adversarial perturbation or Gaussian noise. In particular, our method can locate vulnerable layers that are sensitive to adversarial perturbation and Gaussian noise. We also show that the behavior deviation of vulnerable layers can be used to detect adversarial examples. Secondly, we propose a novel NoiseCAM algorithm that integrates information from globally and pixel-level weighted class activation maps. Our algorithm is susceptible to adversarial perturbations and will not respond to Gaussian random noise mixed in the inputs. Third, we compare detecting adversarial examples using both behavior deviation and NoiseCAM, and we show that NoiseCAM outperforms behavior deviation modeling in its overall performance. Our work could provide a useful tool to defend against certain adversarial attacks on deep neural networks.

> Fuzzing has contributed to automatically identifying bugs and vulnerabilities in the software testing field. Although it can efficiently generate crashing inputs, these inputs are usually analyzed manually. Several root cause analysis (RCA) techniques have been proposed to automatically analyze the root causes of crashes to mitigate this cost. However, outstanding challenges for realizing more elaborate RCA techniques remain unknown owing to the lack of extensive evaluation methods over existing techniques. With this problem in mind, we developed an end-to-end benchmarking platform, RCABench, that can evaluate RCA techniques for various targeted programs in a detailed and comprehensive manner. Our experiments with RCABench indicated that the evaluations in previous studies were not enough to fully support their claims. Moreover, this platform can be leveraged to evaluate emerging RCA techniques by comparing them with existing techniques.

> Diffusion models have achieved great success in a range of tasks, such as image synthesis and molecule design. As such successes hinge on large-scale training data collected from diverse sources, the trustworthiness of these collected data is hard to control or audit. In this work, we aim to explore the vulnerabilities of diffusion models under potential training data manipulations and try to answer: How hard is it to perform Trojan attacks on well-trained diffusion models? What are the adversarial targets that such Trojan attacks can achieve? To answer these questions, we propose an effective Trojan attack against diffusion models, TrojDiff, which optimizes the Trojan diffusion and generative processes during training. In particular, we design novel transitions during the Trojan diffusion process to diffuse adversarial targets into a biased Gaussian distribution and propose a new parameterization of the Trojan generative process that leads to an effective training objective for the attack. In addition, we consider three types of adversarial targets: the Trojaned diffusion models will always output instances belonging to a certain class from the in-domain distribution (In-D2D attack), out-of-domain distribution (Out-D2D-attack), and one specific instance (D2I attack). We evaluate TrojDiff on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets against both DDPM and DDIM diffusion models. We show that TrojDiff always achieves high attack performance under different adversarial targets using different types of triggers, while the performance in benign environments is preserved. The code is available at https://github.com/chenweixin107/TrojDiff.

> An efficient deep learning model that can be implemented in real-time for polyp detection is crucial to reducing polyp miss-rate during screening procedures. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to small changes in the input image. A CNN-based model may miss the same polyp appearing in a series of consecutive frames and produce unsubtle detection output due to changes in camera pose, lighting condition, light reflection, etc. In this study, we attempt to tackle this problem by integrating temporal information among neighboring frames. We propose an efficient feature concatenation method for a CNN-based encoder-decoder model without adding complexity to the model. The proposed method incorporates extracted feature maps of previous frames to detect polyps in the current frame. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method of feature concatenation improves the overall performance of automatic polyp detection in videos. The following results are obtained on a public video dataset: sensitivity 90.94\%, precision 90.53\%, and specificity 92.46%

> Developing automated and smart software vulnerability detection models has been receiving great attention from both research and development communities. One of the biggest challenges in this area is the lack of code samples for all different programming languages. In this study, we address this issue by proposing a transfer learning technique to leverage available datasets and generate a model to detect common vulnerabilities in different programming languages. We use C source code samples to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, then, we use Java source code samples to adopt and evaluate the learned model. We use code samples from two benchmark datasets: NIST Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD) and Draper VDISC dataset. The results show that proposed model detects vulnerabilities in both C and Java codes with average recall of 72\%. Additionally, we employ explainable AI to investigate how much each feature contributes to the knowledge transfer mechanisms between C and Java in the proposed model.

> Many adversarial attacks in NLP perturb inputs to produce visually similar strings ('ergo' $\rightarrow$ '$\epsilon$rgo') which are legible to humans but degrade model performance. Although preserving legibility is a necessary condition for text perturbation, little work has been done to systematically characterize it; instead, legibility is typically loosely enforced via intuitions around the nature and extent of perturbations. Particularly, it is unclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or how to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address this gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string, and rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we collect and release LEGIT, a human-annotated dataset comprising the legibility of visually perturbed text. Using this dataset, we build both text- and vision-based models which achieve up to $0.91$ F1 score in predicting whether an input is legible, and an accuracy of $0.86$ in predicting which of two given perturbations is more legible. Additionally, we discover that legible perturbations from the LEGIT dataset are more effective at lowering the performance of NLP models than best-known attack strategies, suggesting that current models may be vulnerable to a broad range of perturbations beyond what is captured by existing visual attacks. Data, code, and models are available at https://github.com/dvsth/learning-legibility-2023.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many graph learning tasks. However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to both test-time evasion and training-time poisoning attacks that perturb the graph structure. While existing attack methods have shown promising attack performance, we would like to design an attack framework to further enhance the performance. In particular, our attack framework is inspired by certified robustness, which was originally used by defenders to defend against adversarial attacks. We are the first, from the attacker perspective, to leverage its properties to better attack GNNs. Specifically, we first derive nodes' certified perturbation sizes against graph evasion and poisoning attacks based on randomized smoothing, respectively. A larger certified perturbation size of a node indicates this node is theoretically more robust to graph perturbations. Such a property motivates us to focus more on nodes with smaller certified perturbation sizes, as they are easier to be attacked after graph perturbations. Accordingly, we design a certified robustness inspired attack loss, when incorporated into (any) existing attacks, produces our certified robustness inspired attack counterpart. We apply our framework to the existing attacks and results show it can significantly enhance the existing base attacks' performance.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are acknowledged as vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while the existing black-box attacks require extensive queries on the victim DNN to achieve high success rates. For query-efficiency, surrogate models of the victim are used to generate transferable Adversarial Examples (AEs) because of their Gradient Similarity (GS), i.e., surrogates' attack gradients are similar to the victim's ones. However, it is generally neglected to exploit their similarity on outputs, namely the Prediction Similarity (PS), to filter out inefficient queries by surrogates without querying the victim. To jointly utilize and also optimize surrogates' GS and PS, we develop QueryNet, a unified attack framework that can significantly reduce queries. QueryNet creatively attacks by multi-identity surrogates, i.e., crafts several AEs for one sample by different surrogates, and also uses surrogates to decide on the most promising AE for the query. After that, the victim's query feedback is accumulated to optimize not only surrogates' parameters but also their architectures, enhancing both the GS and the PS. Although QueryNet has no access to pre-trained surrogates' prior, it reduces queries by averagely about an order of magnitude compared to alternatives within an acceptable time, according to our comprehensive experiments: 11 victims (including two commercial models) on MNIST/CIFAR10/ImageNet, allowing only 8-bit image queries, and no access to the victim's training data. The code is available at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/QueryNet.

> Due to the numerous advantages of machine learning (ML) algorithms, many applications now incorporate them. However, many studies in the field of image classification have shown that MLs can be fooled by a variety of adversarial attacks. These attacks take advantage of ML algorithms' inherent vulnerability. This raises many questions in the cybersecurity field, where a growing number of researchers are recently investigating the feasibility of such attacks against machine learning-based security systems, such as intrusion detection systems. The majority of this research demonstrates that it is possible to fool a model using features extracted from a raw data source, but it does not take into account the real implementation of such attacks, i.e., the reverse transformation from theory to practice. The real implementation of these adversarial attacks would be influenced by various constraints that would make their execution more difficult. As a result, the purpose of this study was to investigate the actual feasibility of adversarial attacks, specifically evasion attacks, against network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS), demonstrating that it is entirely possible to fool these ML-based IDSs using our proposed adversarial algorithm while assuming as many constraints as possible in a black-box setting. In addition, since it is critical to design defense mechanisms to protect ML-based IDSs against such attacks, a defensive scheme is presented. Realistic botnet traffic traces are used to assess this work. Our goal is to create adversarial botnet traffic that can avoid detection while still performing all of its intended malicious functionality.

> The next era of program understanding is being propelled by the use of machine learning to solve software problems. Recent studies have shown surprising results of source code learning, which applies deep neural networks (DNNs) to various critical software tasks, e.g., bug detection and clone detection. This success can be greatly attributed to the utilization of massive high-quality training data, and in practice, data augmentation, which is a technique used to produce additional training data, has been widely adopted in various domains, such as computer vision. However, in source code learning, data augmentation has not been extensively studied, and existing practice is limited to simple syntax-preserved methods, such as code refactoring. Essentially, source code is often represented in two ways, namely, sequentially as text data and structurally as graph data, when it is used as training data in source code learning. Inspired by these analogy relations, we take an early step to investigate whether data augmentation methods that are originally used for text and graphs are effective in improving the training quality of source code learning. To that end, we first collect and categorize data augmentation methods in the literature. Second, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on four critical tasks and 11 DNN architectures to explore the effectiveness of 12 data augmentation methods (including code refactoring and 11 other methods for text and graph data). Our results identify the data augmentation methods that can produce more accurate and robust models for source code learning, including those based on mixup (e.g., SenMixup for texts and Manifold-Mixup for graphs), and those that slightly break the syntax of source code (e.g., random swap and random deletion for texts).

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are recently shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers embed hidden backdoors in the DNN model by injecting a few poisoned examples into the training dataset. While extensive efforts have been made to detect and remove backdoors from backdoored DNNs, it is still not clear whether a backdoor-free clean model can be directly obtained from poisoned datasets. In this paper, we first construct a causal graph to model the generation process of poisoned data and find that the backdoor attack acts as the confounder, which brings spurious associations between the input images and target labels, making the model predictions less reliable. Inspired by the causal understanding, we propose the Causality-inspired Backdoor Defense (CBD), to learn deconfounded representations for reliable classification. Specifically, a backdoored model is intentionally trained to capture the confounding effects. The other clean model dedicates to capturing the desired causal effects by minimizing the mutual information with the confounding representations from the backdoored model and employing a sample-wise re-weighting scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets against 6 state-of-the-art attacks verify that our proposed defense method is effective in reducing backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in predicting benign samples. Further analysis shows that CBD can also resist potential adaptive attacks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/zaixizhang/CBD}.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their accelerators are being deployed ever more frequently in safety-critical applications leading to increasing reliability concerns. A traditional and accurate method for assessing DNNs' reliability has been resorting to fault injection, which, however, suffers from prohibitive time complexity. While analytical and hybrid fault injection-/analytical-based methods have been proposed, they are either inaccurate or specific to particular accelerator architectures. In this work, we propose a novel accurate, fine-grain, metric-oriented, and accelerator-agnostic method called DeepVigor that provides vulnerability value ranges for DNN neurons' outputs. An outcome of DeepVigor is an analytical model representing vulnerable and non-vulnerable ranges for each neuron that can be exploited to develop different techniques for improving DNNs' reliability. Moreover, DeepVigor provides reliability assessment metrics based on vulnerability factors for bits, neurons, and layers using the vulnerability ranges. The proposed method is not only faster than fault injection but also provides extensive and accurate information about the reliability of DNNs, independent from the accelerator. The experimental evaluations in the paper indicate that the proposed vulnerability ranges are 99.9% to 100% accurate even when evaluated on previously unseen test data. Also, it is shown that the obtained vulnerability factors represent the criticality of bits, neurons, and layers proficiently. DeepVigor is implemented in the PyTorch framework and validated on complex DNN benchmarks.

> Nowadays, numerous applications incorporate machine learning (ML) algorithms due to their prominent achievements. However, many studies in the field of computer vision have shown that ML can be fooled by intentionally crafted instances, called adversarial examples. These adversarial examples take advantage of the intrinsic vulnerability of ML models. Recent research raises many concerns in the cybersecurity field. An increasing number of researchers are studying the feasibility of such attacks on security systems based on ML algorithms, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The feasibility of such adversarial attacks would be influenced by various domain-specific constraints. This can potentially increase the difficulty of crafting adversarial examples. Despite the considerable amount of research that has been done in this area, much of it focuses on showing that it is possible to fool a model using features extracted from the raw data but does not address the practical side, i.e., the reverse transformation from theory to practice. For this reason, we propose a review browsing through various important papers to provide a comprehensive analysis. Our analysis highlights some challenges that have not been addressed in the reviewed papers.

> The concept of fairness is gaining popularity in academia and industry. Social media is especially vulnerable to media biases and toxic language and comments. We propose a fair ML pipeline that takes a text as input and determines whether it contains biases and toxic content. Then, based on pre-trained word embeddings, it suggests a set of new words by substituting the bi-ased words, the idea is to lessen the effects of those biases by replacing them with alternative words. We compare our approach to existing fairness models to determine its effectiveness. The results show that our proposed pipeline can de-tect, identify, and mitigate biases in social media data

> Long-term care service for old people is in great demand in most of the aging societies. The number of nursing homes residents is increasing while the number of care providers is limited. Due to the care worker shortage, care to vulnerable older residents cannot be fully tailored to the unique needs and preference of each individual. This may bring negative impacts on health outcomes and quality of life among institutionalized older people. To improve care quality through personalized care planning and delivery with limited care workforce, we propose a new care planning model assisted by artificial intelligence. We apply bandit algorithms which optimize the clinical decision for care planning by adapting to the sequential feedback from the past decisions. We evaluate the proposed model on empirical data acquired from the Systems for Person-centered Elder Care (SPEC) study, a ICT-enhanced care management program.

> The Internet has been instrumental in connecting under-represented and vulnerable groups of people. Platforms built to foster social interaction and engagement have enabled historically disenfranchised groups to have a voice. One such vulnerable group is women. In this paper, we explore the diversity in online women's ideological spaces using a multi-dimensional approach. We perform a large-scale, data-driven analysis of over 6M Reddit comments and submissions from 14 subreddits. We elicit a diverse taxonomy of online women's ideological spaces, ranging from counterparts to the so-called Manosphere to Gender-Critical Feminism. We then perform content analysis, finding meaningful differences across topics and communities. Finally, we shed light on two platforms, ovarit.com and thepinkpill.co, where two toxic communities of online women's ideological spaces (Gender-Critical Feminism and Femcels) migrated after their ban on Reddit.

> Software development life cycle is profoundly influenced by bugs: their introduction, identification, and eventual resolution account for a significant portion of software cost. This has motivated software engineering researchers and practitioners to propose different approaches for automating the identification and repair of software defects. Large language models have been adapted to the program repair task through few-shot demonstration learning and instruction prompting, treating this as an infilling task. However, these models have only focused on learning general bug-fixing patterns for uncategorized bugs mined from public repositories. In this paper, we propose InferFix: a transformer-based program repair framework paired with a state-of-the-art static analyzer to fix critical security and performance bugs. InferFix combines a Retriever -- transformer encoder model pretrained via contrastive learning objective, which aims at searching for semantically equivalent bugs and corresponding fixes; and a Generator -- a large language model (Codex Cushman) finetuned on supervised bug-fix data with prompts augmented via bug type annotations and semantically similar fixes retrieved from an external non-parametric memory. To train and evaluate our approach, we curated InferredBugs, a novel, metadata-rich dataset of bugs extracted by executing the Infer static analyzer on the change histories of thousands of Java and C# repositories. Our evaluation demonstrates that InferFix outperforms strong LLM baselines, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.6% for generating fixes in C# and 76.8% in Java. We discuss the deployment of InferFix alongside Infer at Microsoft which offers an end-to-end solution for detection, classification, and localization of bugs, as well as fixing and validation of candidate patches, integrated in the continuous integration pipeline to automate the software development workflow.

> DRAM is the primary technology used for main memory in modern systems. Unfortunately, as DRAM scales down to smaller technology nodes, it faces key challenges in both data integrity and latency, which strongly affect overall system reliability, security, and performance. To develop reliable, secure, and high-performance DRAM-based main memory for future systems, it is critical to rigorously characterize, analyze, and understand various aspects (e.g., reliability, retention, latency, RowHammer vulnerability) of existing DRAM chips and their architecture. The goal of this dissertation is to 1) develop techniques and infrastructures to enable such rigorous characterization, analysis, and understanding, and 2) enable new mechanisms to improve DRAM performance, reliability, and security based on the developed understanding.   To this end, in this dissertation, we 1) design, implement, and prototype a new practical-to-use and flexible FPGA-based DRAM characterization infrastructure (called SoftMC), 2) use the DRAM characterization infrastructure to develop a new experimental methodology (called U-TRR) to uncover the operation of existing proprietary in-DRAM RowHammer protection mechanisms and craft new RowHammer access patterns to efficiently circumvent these RowHammer protection mechanisms, 3) propose a new DRAM architecture, called SelfManaging DRAM, for enabling autonomous and efficient in-DRAM maintenance operations that enable not only better performance, efficiency, and reliability but also faster and easier adoption of changes to DRAM chips, and 4) propose a versatile DRAM substrate, called the Copy-Row (CROW) substrate, that enables new mechanisms for improving DRAM performance, energy consumption, and reliability.

- `2303.08581v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08581v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08581v1)

> Federated Learning (FL) is a popular collaborative learning scheme involving multiple clients and a server. FL focuses on protecting clients' data but turns out to be highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property (IP) threats. Since FL periodically collects and distributes the model parameters, a free-rider can download the latest model and thus steal model IP. Split Federated Learning (SFL), a recent variant of FL that supports training with resource-constrained clients, splits the model into two, giving one part of the model to clients (client-side model), and the remaining part to the server (server-side model). Thus SFL prevents model leakage by design. Moreover, by blocking prediction queries, it can be made resistant to advanced IP threats such as traditional Model Extraction (ME) attacks. While SFL is better than FL in terms of providing IP protection, it is still vulnerable. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of SFL and show how malicious clients can launch ME attacks by querying the gradient information from the server side. We propose five variants of ME attack which differs in the gradient usage as well as in the data assumptions. We show that under practical cases, the proposed ME attacks work exceptionally well for SFL. For instance, when the server-side model has five layers, our proposed ME attack can achieve over 90% accuracy with less than 2% accuracy degradation with VGG-11 on CIFAR-10.

> In supervised learning, it has been shown that label noise in the data can be interpolated without penalties on test accuracy. We show that interpolating label noise induces adversarial vulnerability, and prove the first theorem showing the relationship between label noise and adversarial risk for any data distribution. Our results are almost tight if we do not make any assumptions on the inductive bias of the learning algorithm. We then investigate how different components of this problem affect this result, including properties of the distribution. We also discuss non-uniform label noise distributions; and prove a new theorem showing uniform label noise induces nearly as large an adversarial risk as the worst poisoning with the same noise rate. Then, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that uniform label noise is more harmful than typical real-world label noise. Finally, we show how inductive biases amplify the effect of label noise and argue the need for future work in this direction.

> One of the most important challenges in the field of software code audit is the presence of vulnerabilities in software source code. These flaws are highly likely ex-ploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of ser-vice. C and C++ open source code are now available in order to create a large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a siz-able dataset of millions of open-source functions that point to poten-tial exploits. We created an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural network model Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model Long Short Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the de-pendency. Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state of the art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance, we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, re-call, accuracy, and total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as semantic and syntactic represen-tation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs faster than its classical counterpart.

> Every novel technology adds hidden vulnerabilities ready to be exploited by a growing number of cyber-attacks. Automated software testing can be a promising solution to quickly analyze thousands of lines of code by generating and slightly modifying function-specific testing data to encounter a multitude of vulnerabilities and attack vectors. This process draws similarities to the constrained adversarial examples generated by adversarial learning methods, so there could be significant benefits to the integration of these methods in automated testing tools. Therefore, this systematic review is focused on the current state-of-the-art of constrained data generation methods applied for adversarial learning and software testing, aiming to guide researchers and developers to enhance testing tools with adversarial learning methods and improve the resilience and robustness of their digital systems. The found constrained data generation applications for adversarial machine learning were systematized, and the advantages and limitations of approaches specific for software testing were thoroughly analyzed, identifying research gaps and opportunities to improve testing tools with adversarial attack methods.

EARR was created in collaboration among a large tech firm, nonprofits, NGO research institutions, and universities to provide critical research based perspectives and feedback on technology's emergent ethical and social harms. Through semi-structured workshops and discussions within the large tech firm, EARR has provided critical perspectives and feedback on how to conceptualize equity and vulnerability as they relate to AI technology. We outline three principles in practice of how EARR has operated thus far that are especially relevant to the concerns of the FAccT community: how EARR expands the scope of expertise in AI development, how it fosters opportunities for epistemic curiosity and responsibility, and that it creates a space for mutual learning. This paper serves as both an analysis and translation of lessons learned through this engagement approach, and the possibilities for future research.

> Federated learning (FL) has been promoted as a popular technique for training machine learning (ML) models over edge/fog networks. Traditional implementations of FL have largely neglected the potential for inter-network cooperation, treating edge/fog devices and other infrastructure participating in ML as separate processing elements. Consequently, FL has been vulnerable to several dimensions of network heterogeneity, such as varying computation capabilities, communication resources, data qualities, and privacy demands. We advocate for cooperative federated learning (CFL), a cooperative edge/fog ML paradigm built on device-to-device (D2D) and device-to-server (D2S) interactions. Through D2D and D2S cooperation, CFL counteracts network heterogeneity in edge/fog networks through enabling a model/data/resource pooling mechanism, which will yield substantial improvements in ML model training quality and network resource consumption. We propose a set of core methodologies that form the foundation of D2D and D2S cooperation and present preliminary experiments that demonstrate their benefits. We also discuss new FL functionalities enabled by this cooperative framework such as the integration of unlabeled data and heterogeneous device privacy into ML model training. Finally, we describe some open research directions at the intersection of cooperative edge/fog and FL.

> Vulnerability to lexical perturbation is a critical weakness of automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning. This paper proposes Perturbation Robust Multi-Lingual CLIPScore(PR-MCS), which exhibits robustness to such perturbations, as a novel reference-free image captioning metric applicable to multiple languages. To achieve perturbation robustness, we fine-tune the text encoder of CLIP with our language-agnostic method to distinguish the perturbed text from the original text. To verify the robustness of PR-MCS, we introduce a new fine-grained evaluation dataset consisting of detailed captions, critical objects, and the relationships between the objects for 3, 000 images in five languages. In our experiments, PR-MCS significantly outperforms baseline metrics in capturing lexical noise of all various perturbation types in all five languages, proving that PR-MCS is highly robust to lexical perturbations.

> Network connectivity exposes the network infrastructure and assets to vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Protecting network assets against attacks requires the application of security countermeasures. Nevertheless, employing countermeasures incurs costs, such as monetary costs, along with time and energy to prepare and deploy the countermeasures. Thus, an Intrusion Response System (IRS) shall consider security and QoS costs when dynamically selecting the countermeasures to address the detected attacks. This has motivated us to formulate a joint Security-vs-QoS optimization problem to select the best countermeasures in an IRS. The problem is then transformed into a matching game-theoretical model. Considering the monetary costs and attack coverage constraints, we first derive the theoretical upper bound for the problem and later propose stable matching-based solutions to address the trade-off. The performance of the proposed solution, considering different settings, is validated over a series of simulations.

> To implement a blockchain, we need a blockchain protocol for all the nodes to follow. To design a blockchain protocol, we need a block publisher selection mechanism and a chain selection rule. In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based blockchain protocols, block publisher selection mechanism selects the node to publish the next block based on the relative stake held by the node. However, PoS protocols, such as Ouroboros v1, may face vulnerability to fully adaptive corruptions.   In this paper, we propose a novel PoS-based blockchain protocol, QuickSync, to achieve security against fully adaptive corruptions while improving on performance. We propose a metric called block power, a value defined for each block, derived from the output of the verifiable random function based on the digital signature of the block publisher. With this metric, we compute chain power, the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain, for all the valid chains. These metrics are a function of the block publisher's stake to enable the PoS aspect of the protocol. The chain selection rule selects the chain with the highest chain power as the one to extend. This chain selection rule hence determines the selected block publisher of the previous block. When we use metrics to define the chain selection rule, it may lead to vulnerabilities against Sybil attacks. QuickSync uses a Sybil attack resistant function implemented using histogram matching. We prove that QuickSync satisfies common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties and hence it is secure. We also show that it is resilient to different types of adversarial attack strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that QuickSync performs better than Bitcoin by an order of magnitude on both transactions per second and time to finality, and better than Ouroboros v1 by a factor of three on time to finality.

> Geometric deep learning has sparked a rising interest in computer graphics to perform shape understanding tasks, such as shape classification and semantic segmentation. When the input is a polygonal surface, one has to suffer from the irregular mesh structure. Motivated by the geometric spectral theory, we introduce Laplacian2Mesh, a novel and flexible convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for coping with irregular triangle meshes (vertices may have any valence). By mapping the input mesh surface to the multi-dimensional Laplacian-Beltrami space, Laplacian2Mesh enables one to perform shape analysis tasks directly using the mature CNNs, without the need to deal with the irregular connectivity of the mesh structure. We further define a mesh pooling operation such that the receptive field of the network can be expanded while retaining the original vertex set as well as the connections between them. Besides, we introduce a channel-wise self-attention block to learn the individual importance of feature ingredients. Laplacian2Mesh not only decouples the geometry from the irregular connectivity of the mesh structure but also better captures the global features that are central to shape classification and segmentation. Extensive tests on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Laplacian2Mesh, particularly in terms of the capability of being vulnerable to noise to fulfill various learning tasks.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) like Codex are powerful tools for performing code completion and code generation tasks as they are trained on billions of lines of code from publicly available sources. Moreover, these models are capable of generating code snippets from Natural Language (NL) descriptions by learning languages and programming practices from public GitHub repositories. Although LLMs promise an effortless NL-driven deployment of software applications, the security of the code they generate has not been extensively investigated nor documented. In this work, we present LLMSecEval, a dataset containing 150 NL prompts that can be leveraged for assessing the security performance of such models. Such prompts are NL descriptions of code snippets prone to various security vulnerabilities listed in MITRE's Top 25 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ranking. Each prompt in our dataset comes with a secure implementation example to facilitate comparative evaluations against code produced by LLMs. As a practical application, we show how LLMSecEval can be used for evaluating the security of snippets automatically generated from NL descriptions.

> Copyright protection for deep neural networks (DNNs) is an urgent need for AI corporations. To trace illegally distributed model copies, DNN watermarking is an emerging technique for embedding and verifying secret identity messages in the prediction behaviors or the model internals. Sacrificing less functionality and involving more knowledge about the target DNN, the latter branch called \textit{white-box DNN watermarking} is believed to be accurate, credible and secure against most known watermark removal attacks, with emerging research efforts in both the academy and the industry.   In this paper, we present the first systematic study on how the mainstream white-box DNN watermarks are commonly vulnerable to neural structural obfuscation with \textit{dummy neurons}, a group of neurons which can be added to a target model but leave the model behavior invariant. Devising a comprehensive framework to automatically generate and inject dummy neurons with high stealthiness, our novel attack intensively modifies the architecture of the target model to inhibit the success of watermark verification. With extensive evaluation, our work for the first time shows that nine published watermarking schemes require amendments to their verification procedures.

> Mobile software apps ("apps") are one of the prevailing digital technologies that our modern life heavily depends on. A key issue in the development of apps is how to design gender-inclusive apps. Apps that do not consider gender inclusion, diversity, and equality in their design can create barriers (e.g., excluding some of the users because of their gender) for their diverse users. While there have been some efforts to develop gender-inclusive apps, a lack of deep understanding regarding user perspectives on gender may prevent app developers and owners from identifying issues related to gender and proposing solutions for improvement. Users express many different opinions about apps in their reviews, from sharing their experiences, and reporting bugs, to requesting new features. In this study, we aim at unpacking gender discussions about apps from the user perspective by analysing app reviews. We first develop and evaluate several Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) classifiers that automatically detect gender reviews (i.e., reviews that contain discussions about gender). We apply our ML and DL classifiers on a manually constructed dataset of 1,440 app reviews from the Google App Store, composing 620 gender reviews and 820 non-gender reviews. Our best classifier achieves an F1-score of 90.77%. Second, our qualitative analysis of a randomly selected 388 out of 620 gender reviews shows that gender discussions in app reviews revolve around six topics: App Features, Appearance, Content, Company Policy and Censorship, Advertisement, and Community. Finally, we provide some practical implications and recommendations for developing gender-inclusive apps.

> Modern mission-critical systems (MCS) are increasingly softwarized and interconnected. As a result, their complexity increased, and so their vulnerability against cyber-attacks. The current adoption of virtualization and service-oriented architectures (SOA) in MCSs provides additional flexibility that can be leveraged to withstand and mitigate attacks, e.g., by moving critical services or data flows. This enables the deployment of strategies for moving target defense (MTD), which allows stripping attackers of their asymmetric advantage from the long reconnaissance of MCSs. However, it is challenging to design MTD strategies, given the diverse threat landscape, resource limitations, and potential degradation in service availability. In this paper, we combine two optimization models to explore feasible service configurations for SOA-based systems and to derive subsequent MTD actions with their time schedule based on an attacker-defender game. Our results indicate that even for challenging and diverse attack scenarios, our models can defend the system by up to 90% of the system operation time with a limited MTD defender budget.

> Test effectiveness refers to the capability of a test suite in exposing faults in software.   It is crucial to be aware of factors that influence this capability.   We aim at inferring the causal relationship between the two factors (i.e., Cover/Exec) and the capability of a test suite to expose and discover faults in software. Cover refers to the number of distinct test cases covering the statement and Exec equals the number of times a test suite executes a statement. We analyzed 459166 software faults from {12} Java programs. Bayesian statistics along with the back-door criterion was exploited for the purpose of causal inference. Furthermore, we examined the common pitfall measuring association, the mixture of causal and noncausal relationships, instead of causal association. The results show that Cover is of more causal association as against \textit{Exec}, and the causal association and noncausal one for those variables are statistically different. Software developers could exploit the results to design and write more effective test cases, which lead to discovering more bugs hidden in software.

> Ensembling can improve the performance of Neural Networks, but existing approaches struggle when the architecture likelihood surface has dispersed, narrow peaks. Furthermore, existing methods construct equally weighted ensembles, and this is likely to be vulnerable to the failure modes of the weaker architectures. By viewing ensembling as approximately marginalising over architectures we construct ensembles using the tools of Bayesian Quadrature -- tools which are well suited to the exploration of likelihood surfaces with dispersed, narrow peaks. Additionally, the resulting ensembles consist of architectures weighted commensurate with their performance. We show empirically -- in terms of test likelihood, accuracy, and expected calibration error -- that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and verify via ablation studies that its components do so independently.

> Adversarial robustness is a key concept in measuring the ability of neural networks to defend against adversarial attacks during the inference phase. Recent studies have shown that despite the success of improving adversarial robustness against a single type of attack using robust training techniques, models are still vulnerable to diversified $\ell_p$ attacks. To achieve diversified $\ell_p$ robustness, we propose a novel robust mode connectivity (RMC)-oriented adversarial defense that contains two population-based learning phases. The first phase, RMC, is able to search the model parameter space between two pre-trained models and find a path containing points with high robustness against diversified $\ell_p$ attacks. In light of the effectiveness of RMC, we develop a second phase, RMC-based optimization, with RMC serving as the basic unit for further enhancement of neural network diversified $\ell_p$ robustness. To increase computational efficiency, we incorporate learning with a self-robust mode connectivity (SRMC) module that enables the fast proliferation of the population used for endpoints of RMC. Furthermore, we draw parallels between SRMC and the human immune system. Experimental results on various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that the proposed defense methods can achieve high diversified $\ell_p$ robustness against $\ell_\infty$, $\ell_2$, $\ell_1$, and hybrid attacks.

> Today, large amounts of data are being continuously produced, collected, and exchanged between systems. As the number of devices, systems and data produced grows up, the risk of security breaches increases. This is all the more relevant in times of COVID-19, which has affected not only the health and lives of human beings' but also the lifestyle of society, i.e., the digital environment has replaced the physical. This has led to an increase in cyber security threats of various nature. While security breaches and different security protection mechanisms have been widely covered in the literature, the concept of a primitive artifact such as data management system seems to have been more neglected by researchers and practitioners. But are data management systems always protected by default? Previous research and regular updates on data leakages suggest that the number and nature of these vulnerabilities are high. It also refers to little or no DBMS protection, especially in case of NoSQL, which are thus vulnerable to attacks. The aim of this paper is to examine whether traditional vulnerability registries provide a sufficiently comprehensive view of DBMS security, or they should be intensively and dynamically inspected by DBMS owners by referring to Internet of Things Search Engines moving towards a sustainable and resilient digitized environment. The paper brings attention to this problem and makes the reader think about data security before looking for and introducing more advanced security and protection mechanisms, which, in the absence of the above, may bring no value.

We show that systems trained with the original FVQA train sets can be vulnerable to adversarial samples and we demonstrate an augmentation scheme to reduce this vulnerability without human annotations.

> Temporal memory safety bugs, especially use-after-free and double free bugs, pose a major security threat to C programs. Real-world exploits utilizing these bugs enable attackers to read and write arbitrary memory locations, causing disastrous violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Many previous solutions retrofit temporal memory safety to C, but they all either incur high performance overhead and/or miss detecting certain types of temporal memory safety bugs.   In this paper, we propose a temporal memory safety solution that is both efficient and comprehensive. Specifically, we extend Checked C, a spatially-safe extension to C, with temporally-safe pointers. These are implemented by combining two techniques: fat pointers and dynamic key-lock checks. We show that the fat-pointer solution significantly improves running time and memory overhead compared to the disjoint-metadata approach that provides the same level of protection. With empirical program data and hands-on experience porting real-world applications, we also show that our solution is practical in terms of backward compatibility -- one of the major complaints about fat pointers.

> Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer. Patients are vulnerable to mental health illnesses which can reduce the effectiveness of the cancer treatment and the patients adherence to drug plans. It is crucial to preserve the mental health of patients while they are receiving treatment. However, current art therapy approaches are not personal and unique to the patient. We aim to provide a well-trained image style transfer model that can quickly generate unique art from personal dermoscopic melanoma images as an additional tool for art therapy in disease management of melanoma. Visual art appreciation as a common form of art therapy in disease management that measurably reduces the degree of psychological distress. We developed a network based on the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network for style transfer that generates personalized and unique artworks from dermoscopic melanoma images. We developed a model that converts melanoma images into unique flower-themed artworks that relate to the shape of the lesion and are therefore personal to the patient. Further, we altered the initial framework and made comparisons and evaluations of the results. With this, we increased the options in the toolbox for art therapy in disease management of melanoma. The development of an easy-to-use user interface ensures the availability of the approach to stakeholders. The transformation of melanoma into flower-themed artworks is achieved by the proposed model and the graphical user interface. This contribution opens a new field of GANs in art therapy and could lead to more personalized disease management.

> The security context used in 5G authentication is generated during the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure and stored in both the user equipment (UE) and the network sides for the subsequent fast registration procedure. Given its importance, it is imperative to formally analyze the security mechanism of the security context. The security context in the UE can be stored in the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) card or in the baseband chip. In this work, we present a comprehensive and formal verification of the fast registration procedure based on the security context under the two scenarios in ProVerif. Our analysis identifies two vulnerabilities, including one that has not been reported before. Specifically, the security context stored in the USIM card can be read illegally, and the validity checking mechanism of the security context in the baseband chip can be bypassed. Moreover, these vulnerabilities also apply to 4G networks. As a consequence, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to register to the network with the victim's identity and then launch other attacks, including one-tap authentication bypass leading to privacy disclosure, location spoofing, etc. To ensure that these attacks are indeed realizable in practice, we have responsibly confirmed them through experimentation in three operators. Our analysis reveals that these vulnerabilities stem from design flaws of the standard and unsafe practices by operators. We finally propose several potential countermeasures to prevent these attacks. We have reported our findings to the GSMA and received a coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) number CVD-2022-0057.

> 3D object detection is an important task in autonomous driving to perceive the surroundings. Despite the excellent performance, the existing 3D detectors lack the robustness to real-world corruptions caused by adverse weathers, sensor noises, etc., provoking concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. To comprehensively and rigorously benchmark the corruption robustness of 3D detectors, in this paper we design 27 types of common corruptions for both LiDAR and camera inputs considering real-world driving scenarios. By synthesizing these corruptions on public datasets, we establish three corruption robustness benchmarks -- KITTI-C, nuScenes-C, and Waymo-C. Then, we conduct large-scale experiments on 24 diverse 3D object detection models to evaluate their corruption robustness. Based on the evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) motion-level corruptions are the most threatening ones that lead to significant performance drop of all models; 2) LiDAR-camera fusion models demonstrate better robustness; 3) camera-only models are extremely vulnerable to image corruptions, showing the indispensability of LiDAR point clouds. We release the benchmarks and codes at https://github.com/kkkcx/3D_Corruptions_AD. We hope that our benchmarks and findings can provide insights for future research on developing robust 3D object detection models.

> Port scanning refers to the systematic exploration of networked computing systems. The goal of port scanning is to identify active services and associated information. Although this technique is often employed by malicious actors to locate vulnerable systems within a network, port scanning is also a legitimate method employed by IT professionals to troubleshoot network issues and maintain system security. In the case of the latter, cybersecurity practitioners use port scanning catalog exposed systems, identify potential misconfigurations, or test controls that may be running on a system. Existing literature has thoroughly established a taxonomy for port scanning. The taxonomy maps the types of scans as well as techniques. In fact, there are several tools mentioned repeatedly in the literature. Those are Nmap, Zmap, and masscan. Further, the presence of multiple tools signals that how a port scanner interacts with target systems impacts the output of the tool. In other words, the various tools may not behave identically or produce identical output. Yet, no work has been done to quantify the efficacy for these popular tools in a uniform, rigorous manner. Accordingly, we used a comparative experimental protocol to measure the accuracy, false positive, false negative, and efficiency of Nmap, Zmap, and masscan. The results show no difference between port scanners in general performance. However, the results revealed a statistically significant difference in efficiency. This information can be used to guide the selection of port scanning tools based on specific needs and requirements. As well, for researchers, the outcomes may also suggest areas for future work in the development novel port scanning tools.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have enjoyed wide spread applications in graph-structured data. However, existing graph based applications commonly lack annotated data. GNNs are required to learn latent patterns from a limited amount of training data to perform inferences on a vast amount of test data. The increased complexity of GNNs, as well as a single point of model parameter initialization, usually lead to overfitting and sub-optimal performance. In addition, it is known that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we push one step forward on the ensemble learning of GNNs with improved accuracy, generalization, and adversarial robustness. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a new method called GNN-Ensemble to construct an ensemble of random decision graph neural networks whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for improvement in performance. The essence of the method is to build multiple GNNs in randomly selected substructures in the topological space and subfeatures in the feature space, and then combine them for final decision making. These GNNs in different substructure and subfeature spaces generalize their classification in complementary ways. Consequently, their combined classification performance can be improved and overfitting on the training data can be effectively reduced. In the meantime, we show that GNN-Ensemble can significantly improve the adversarial robustness against attacks on GNNs.

> With the advent of powerful neural language models, AI-based systems to assist developers in coding tasks are becoming widely available; Copilot is one such system. Copilot uses Codex, a large language model (LLM), to complete code conditioned on a preceding "prompt". Codex, however, is trained on public GitHub repositories, viz., on code that may include bugs and vulnerabilities. Previous studies [1], [2] show Codex reproduces vulnerabilities seen in training. In this study, we examine how prone Codex is to generate an interesting bug category, single statement bugs, commonly referred to as simple, stupid bugs or SStuBs in the MSR community. We find that Codex and similar LLMs do help avoid some SStuBs, but do produce known, verbatim SStuBs as much as 2x as likely than known, verbatim correct code. We explore the consequences of the Codex generated SStuBs and propose avoidance strategies that suggest the possibility of reducing the production of known, verbatim SStubs, and increase the possibility of producing known, verbatim fixes.

> This paper presents a novel holistic deep learning framework that simultaneously addresses the challenges of vulnerability to input perturbations, overparametrization, and performance instability from different train-validation splits. The proposed framework holistically improves accuracy, robustness, sparsity, and stability over standard deep learning models, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on both tabular and image data sets. The results are further validated by ablation experiments and SHAP value analysis, which reveal the interactions and trade-offs between the different evaluation metrics. To support practitioners applying our framework, we provide a prescriptive approach that offers recommendations for selecting an appropriate training loss function based on their specific objectives.

As a corollary, we obtain that GI is not $\textsf{AC}^{0}$-reducible to isomorphism testing of Latin square graphs and strongly regular graphs arising from special cases of Steiner $2$-designs. We accomplish this by showing that the generator-enumeration technique for each of these problems can be implemented in $\beta_{2}\textsf{FOLL}$, which cannot compute Parity (Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, & Wagner, ACM Trans.

> The next generation of cellular technology, 6G, is being developed to enable a wide range of new applications and services for the Internet of Things (IoT). One of 6G's main advantages for IoT applications is its ability to support much higher data rates and bandwidth as well as to support ultra-low latency. However, with this increased connectivity will come to an increased risk of cyber threats, as attackers will be able to exploit the large network of connected devices. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to detect and prevent cyber attacks by continuously learning and adapting to new threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we discuss the use of generative AI for cyber threat-hunting (CTH) in 6G-enabled IoT networks. Then, we propose a new generative adversarial network (GAN) and Transformer-based model for CTH in 6G-enabled IoT Networks. The experimental analysis results with a new cyber security dataset demonstrate that the Transformer-based security model for CTH can detect IoT attacks with a high overall accuracy of 95%. We examine the challenges and opportunities and conclude by highlighting the potential of generative AI in enhancing the security of 6G-enabled IoT networks and call for further research to be conducted in this area.

> GitHub's issue reports provide developers with valuable information that is essential to the evolution of a software development project. Contributors can use these reports to perform software engineering tasks like submitting bugs, requesting features, and collaborating on ideas. In the initial versions of issue reports, there was no standard way of using them. As a result, the quality of issue reports varied widely. To improve the quality of issue reports, GitHub introduced issue report templates (IRTs), which pre-fill issue descriptions when a new issue is opened. An IRT usually contains greeting contributors, describing project guidelines, and collecting relevant information. However, despite of effectiveness of this feature which was introduced in 2016, only nearly 5% of GitHub repositories (with more than 10 stars) utilize it. There are currently few articles on IRTs, and the available ones only consider a small number of repositories. In this work, we introduce GIRT-Data, the first and largest dataset of IRTs in both YAML and Markdown format. This dataset and its corresponding open-source crawler tool are intended to support research in this area and to encourage more developers to use IRTs in their repositories. The stable version of the dataset contains 1,084,300 repositories and 50,032 of them support IRTs. The stable version of the dataset and crawler is available here: https://github.com/kargaranamir/girt-data

> We inspected 45 actively deployed Operational Technology (OT) product families from ten major vendors and found that every system suffers from at least one trivial vulnerability. We reported a total of 53 weaknesses, stemming from insecure by design practices or basic security design failures. They enable attackers to take a device offline, manipulate its operational parameters, and execute arbitrary code without any constraint. We discuss why vulnerable products are often security certified and appear to be more secure than they actually are, and we explain complicating factors of OT risk management.

> The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised concerns about the security of connected devices. There is a need to develop suitable and cost-efficient methods to identify vulnerabilities in IoT devices in order to address them before attackers seize opportunities to compromise them. The deception technique is a prominent approach to improving the security posture of IoT systems. Honeypot is a popular deception technique that mimics interaction in real fashion and encourages unauthorised users (attackers) to launch attacks. Due to the large number and the heterogeneity of IoT devices, manually crafting the low and high-interaction honeypots is not affordable. This has forced researchers to seek innovative ways to build honeypots for IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a honeypot for IoT devices that uses machine learning techniques to learn and interact with attackers automatically. The evaluation of the proposed model indicates that our system can improve the session length with attackers and capture more attacks on the IoT network.

> Diffusion models have attracted attention in recent years as innovative generative models. In this paper, we investigate whether a diffusion model is resistant to a membership inference attack, which evaluates the privacy leakage of a machine learning model. We primarily discuss the diffusion model from the standpoints of comparison with a generative adversarial network (GAN) as conventional models and hyperparameters unique to the diffusion model, i.e., time steps, sampling steps, and sampling variances. We conduct extensive experiments with DDIM as a diffusion model and DCGAN as a GAN on the CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets in both white-box and black-box settings and then confirm if the diffusion model is comparably resistant to a membership inference attack as GAN. Next, we demonstrate that the impact of time steps is significant and intermediate steps in a noise schedule are the most vulnerable to the attack. We also found two key insights through further analysis. First, we identify that DDIM is vulnerable to the attack for small sample sizes instead of achieving a lower FID. Second, sampling steps in hyperparameters are important for resistance to the attack, whereas the impact of sampling variances is quite limited.

- *Xunguang Wang, Jiawang Bai, Xinyue Xu, Xiaomeng Li*

- `2303.12658v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12658v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12658v1)

> Deep hashing has been extensively applied to massive image retrieval due to its efficiency and effectiveness. Recently, several adversarial attacks have been presented to reveal the vulnerability of deep hashing models against adversarial examples. However, existing attack methods suffer from degraded performance or inefficiency because they underutilize the semantic relations between original samples or spend a lot of time learning these relations with a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a novel Pharos-guided Attack, dubbed PgA, to evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep hashing networks reliably and efficiently. Specifically, we design pharos code to represent the semantics of the benign image, which preserves the similarity to semantically relevant samples and dissimilarity to irrelevant ones. It is proven that we can quickly calculate the pharos code via a simple math formula. Accordingly, PgA can directly conduct a reliable and efficient attack on deep hashing-based retrieval by maximizing the similarity between the hash code of the adversarial example and the pharos code. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prior state-of-the-arts in both attack strength and speed.

> In practice, metric analysis on a specific train and test dataset does not guarantee reliable or fair ML models. This is partially due to the fact that obtaining a balanced, diverse, and perfectly labeled dataset is typically expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. Rather than relying on a carefully designed test set to assess ML models' failures, fairness, or robustness, this paper proposes Semantic Image Attack (SIA), a method based on the adversarial attack that provides semantic adversarial images to allow model diagnosis, interpretability, and robustness. Traditional adversarial training is a popular methodology for robustifying ML models against attacks. However, existing adversarial methods do not combine the two aspects that enable the interpretation and analysis of the model's flaws: semantic traceability and perceptual quality. SIA combines the two features via iterative gradient ascent on a predefined semantic attribute space and the image space. We illustrate the validity of our approach in three scenarios for keypoint detection and classification. (1) Model diagnosis: SIA generates a histogram of attributes that highlights the semantic vulnerability of the ML model (i.e., attributes that make the model fail). (2) Stronger attacks: SIA generates adversarial examples with visually interpretable attributes that lead to higher attack success rates than baseline methods. The adversarial training on SIA improves the transferable robustness across different gradient-based attacks. (3) Robustness to imbalanced datasets: we use SIA to augment the underrepresented classes, which outperforms strong augmentation and re-balancing baselines.

> Security associated threats are often increased for online social media during a pandemic, such as COVID-19, along with changes in a work environment. For example, employees in many companies and organizations have started to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such working style has increased many remote activities and further relied on email for communication, thus creating an ideal condition for email fraud schemes. Motivated by this observation, the main purpose of this work is to evaluate the privacy policy of online social media and identify potential security associated problems. First, we perform a risk analysis of online social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn by using the STRIDE model. This aims to find threats and vulnerabilities in the online social media. Then in this analysis, the phishing attack was found to be a main threat in online social media, which is a social engineering attack, where users are convinced through some fake messages or emails to extract their personal credentials.

> Nowadays automated dynamic analysis frameworks for continuous testing are in high demand to ensure software safety and satisfy the security development lifecycle (SDL) requirements. The security bug hunting efficiency of cutting-edge hybrid fuzzing techniques outperforms widely utilized coverage-guided fuzzing. We propose an enhanced dynamic analysis pipeline to leverage productivity of automated bug detection based on hybrid fuzzing. We implement the proposed pipeline in the continuous fuzzing toolset Sydr-Fuzz which is powered by hybrid fuzzing orchestrator, integrating our DSE tool Sydr with libFuzzer and AFL++. Sydr-Fuzz also incorporates security predicate checkers, crash triaging tool Casr, and utilities for corpus minimization and coverage gathering. The benchmarking of our hybrid fuzzer against alternative state-of-the-art solutions demonstrates its superiority over coverage-guided fuzzers while remaining on the same level with advanced hybrid fuzzers. Furthermore, we approve the relevance of our approach by discovering 85 new real-world software flaws within the OSS-Sydr-Fuzz project. Finally, we open Casr source code to the community to facilitate examination of the existing crashes.

> Randomness, mainly in the form of random numbers, is the fundamental prerequisite for the security of many cryptographic tasks. Quantum randomness can be extracted even if adversaries are fully aware of the protocol and even control the randomness source. However, an adversary can further manipulate the randomness via tailored detector blinding attacks, which are hacking attacks suffered by protocols with trusted detectors. Here, by treating no-click events as valid events, we propose a quantum random number generation protocol that can simultaneously address source vulnerability and ferocious tailored detector blinding attacks. The method can be extended to high-dimensional random number generation. We experimentally demonstrate the ability of our protocol to generate random numbers for two-dimensional measurement with a generation speed of 0.1 bit per pulse.

> The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of diffusion learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed scheme for both convex and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.

> Developers often struggle to navigate an Open Source Software (OSS) project's issue-tracking system and find a suitable task. Proper issue labeling can aid task selection, but current tools are limited to classifying the issues according to their type (e.g., bug, question, good first issue, feature, etc.). In contrast, this paper presents a tool (GiveMeLabeledIssues) that mines project repositories and labels issues based on the skills required to solve them. We leverage the domain of the APIs involved in the solution (e.g., User Interface (UI), Test, Databases (DB), etc.) as a proxy for the required skills. GiveMeLabeledIssues facilitates matching developers' skills to tasks, reducing the burden on project maintainers. The tool obtained a precision of 83.9% when predicting the API domains involved in the issues. The replication package contains instructions on executing the tool and including new projects.

> The neural network has become an integral part of modern software systems. However, they still suffer from various problems, in particular, vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we present a novel program reasoning framework for neural-network verification, which we refer to as symbolic reasoning. The key components of our framework are the use of the symbolic domain and the quadratic relation. The symbolic domain has very flexible semantics, and the quadratic relation is quite expressive. They allow us to encode many verification problems for neural networks as quadratic programs. Our scheme then relaxes the quadratic programs to semidefinite programs, which can be efficiently solved. This framework allows us to verify various neural-network properties under different scenarios, especially those that appear challenging for non-symbolic domains. Moreover, it introduces new representations and perspectives for the verification tasks. We believe that our framework can bring new theoretical insights and practical tools to verification problems for neural networks.

> Self-supervised learning in computer vision trains on unlabeled data, such as images or (image, text) pairs, to obtain an image encoder that learns high-quality embeddings for input data. Emerging backdoor attacks towards encoders expose crucial vulnerabilities of self-supervised learning, since downstream classifiers (even further trained on clean data) may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders. Existing backdoor detection methods mainly focus on supervised learning settings and cannot handle pre-trained encoders especially when input labels are not available. In this paper, we propose DECREE, the first backdoor detection approach for pre-trained encoders, requiring neither classifier headers nor input labels. We evaluate DECREE on over 400 encoders trojaned under 3 paradigms. We show the effectiveness of our method on image encoders pre-trained on ImageNet and OpenAI's CLIP 400 million image-text pairs. Our method consistently has a high detection accuracy even if we have only limited or no access to the pre-training dataset.

> Image deep steganography (IDS) is a technique that utilizes deep learning to embed a secret image invisibly into a cover image to generate a container image. However, the container images generated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to attacks that distort their high-frequency components. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called Low-frequency Image Deep Steganography (LIDS) that allows frequency distribution manipulation in the embedding process. LIDS extracts a feature map from the secret image and adds it to the cover image to yield the container image. The container image is not directly output by the CNNs, and thus, it does not contain high-frequency artifacts. The extracted feature map is regulated by a frequency loss to ensure that its frequency distribution mainly concentrates on the low-frequency domain. To further enhance robustness, an attack layer is inserted to damage the container image. The retrieval network then retrieves a recovered secret image from a damaged container image. Our experiments demonstrate that LIDS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness, while maintaining high fidelity and specificity. By avoiding high-frequency artifacts and manipulating the frequency distribution of the embedded feature map, LIDS achieves improved robustness against attacks that distort the high-frequency components of container images.

> Despite our best efforts, deep learning models remain highly vulnerable to even tiny adversarial perturbations applied to the inputs. The ability to extract information from solely the output of a machine learning model to craft adversarial perturbations to black-box models is a practical threat against real-world systems, such as autonomous cars or machine learning models exposed as a service (MLaaS). Of particular interest are sparse attacks. The realization of sparse attacks in black-box models demonstrates that machine learning models are more vulnerable than we believe. Because these attacks aim to minimize the number of perturbed pixels measured by l_0 norm-required to mislead a model by solely observing the decision (the predicted label) returned to a model query; the so-called decision-based attack setting. But, such an attack leads to an NP-hard optimization problem. We develop an evolution-based algorithm-SparseEvo-for the problem and evaluate against both convolutional deep neural networks and vision transformers. Notably, vision transformers are yet to be investigated under a decision-based attack setting. SparseEvo requires significantly fewer model queries than the state-of-the-art sparse attack Pointwise for both untargeted and targeted attacks. The attack algorithm, although conceptually simple, is also competitive with only a limited query budget against the state-of-the-art gradient-based whitebox attacks in standard computer vision tasks such as ImageNet. Importantly, the query efficient SparseEvo, along with decision-based attacks, in general, raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed systems and poses new directions to study and understand the robustness of machine learning models.

> At present, millions of Ethereum smart contracts are created per year and attract financially motivated attackers. However, existing analyzers do not meet the need to precisely analyze the financial security of large numbers of contracts. In this paper, we propose and implement FASVERIF, an automated analyzer for fine-grained analysis of smart contracts' financial security. On the one hand, FASVERIF automatically generates models to be verified against security properties of smart contracts. On the other hand, our analyzer automatically generates the security properties, which is different from existing formal verifiers for smart contracts. As a result, FASVERIF can automatically process source code of smart contracts, and uses formal methods whenever possible to simultaneously maximize its accuracy.   We evaluate FASVERIF on a vulnerabilities dataset by comparing it with other automatic tools. Our evaluation shows that FASVERIF greatly outperforms the representative tools using different technologies, with respect to accuracy and coverage of types of vulnerabilities.

> Smart contracts are programs deployed on a blockchain and are immutable once deployed. Reentrancy, one of the most important vulnerabilities in smart contracts, has caused millions of dollars in financial loss. Many reentrancy detection approaches have been proposed. It is necessary to investigate the performance of these approaches to provide useful guidelines for their application. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on the capability of five well-known or recent reentrancy detection tools such as Mythril and Sailfish. We collect 230,548 verified smart contracts from Etherscan and use detection tools to analyze 139,424 contracts after deduplication, which results in 21,212 contracts with reentrancy issues. Then, we manually examine the defective functions located by the tools in the contracts. From the examination results, we obtain 34 true positive contracts with reentrancy and 21,178 false positive contracts without reentrancy. We also analyze the causes of the true and false positives. Finally, we evaluate the tools based on the two kinds of contracts. The results show that more than 99.8% of the reentrant contracts detected by the tools are false positives with eight types of causes, and the tools can only detect the reentrancy issues caused by call.value(), 58.8% of which can be revealed by the Ethereum's official IDE, Remix. Furthermore, we collect real-world reentrancy attacks reported in the past two years and find that the tools fail to find any issues in the corresponding contracts. Based on the findings, existing works on reentrancy detection appear to have very limited capability, and researchers should turn the rudder to discover and detect new reentrancy patterns except those related to call.value().

> Recent studies have revealed that 87 % to 96 % of the Android apps using cryptographic APIs have a misuse which may cause security vulnerabilities. As previous studies did not conduct a qualitative examination of the validity and severity of the findings, our objective was to understand the findings in more depth. We analyzed a set of 936 open-source Java applications for cryptographic misuses. Our study reveals that 88.10 % of the analyzed applications fail to use cryptographic APIs securely. Through our manual analysis of a random sample, we gained new insights into effective false positives. For example, every fourth misuse of the frequently misused JCA class MessageDigest is an effective false positive due to its occurrence in a non-security context. As we wanted to gain deeper insights into the security implications of these misuses, we created an extensive vulnerability model for cryptographic API misuses. Our model includes previously undiscussed attacks in the context of cryptographic APIs such as DoS attacks. This model reveals that nearly half of the misuses are of high severity, e.g., hard-coded credentials and potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in detecting intellectual property (IP) piracy and hardware Trojans (HTs). However, the machine learning community has demonstrated that GNNs are susceptible to data poisoning attacks, which result in GNNs performing abnormally on graphs with pre-defined backdoor triggers (realized using crafted subgraphs). Thus, it is imperative to ensure that the adoption of GNNs should not introduce security vulnerabilities in critical security frameworks.   Existing backdoor attacks on GNNs generate random subgraphs with specific sizes/densities to act as backdoor triggers. However, for Boolean circuits, backdoor triggers cannot be randomized since the added structures should not affect the functionality of a design.   We explore this threat and develop PoisonedGNN as the first backdoor attack on GNNs in the context of hardware design. We design and inject backdoor triggers into the register-transfer- or the gate-level representation of a given design without affecting the functionality to evade some GNN-based detection procedures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PoisonedGNN, we consider two case studies: (i) Hiding HTs and (ii) IP piracy. Our experiments on TrustHub datasets demonstrate that PoisonedGNN can hide HTs and IP piracy from advanced GNN-based detection platforms with an attack success rate of up to 100%.

> With the rapid development of the computer industry and computer software, the risk of software vulnerabilities being exploited has greatly increased. However, there are still many shortcomings in the existing mining techniques for leakage source research, such as high false alarm rate, coarse-grained detection, and dependence on expert experience. In this paper, we mainly use the c/c++ source code data of the SARD dataset, process the source code of CWE476, CWE469, CWE516 and CWE570 vulnerability types, test the Joern vulnerability scanning function of the cutting-edge tool, and propose a new cascading deep learning model VMCDL based on source code control flow to effectively detect vulnerabilities. First, this paper uses joern to locate and extract sensitive functions and statements to form a sensitive statement library of vulnerable code. Then, the CFG flow vulnerability code snippets are generated by bidirectional breadth-first traversal, and then vectorized by Doc2vec. Finally, the cascade deep learning model based on source code control flow is used for classification to obtain the classification results. In the experimental evaluation, we give the test results of Joern on specific vulnerabilities, and give the confusion matrix and label data of the binary classification results of the model algorithm on single vulnerability type source code, and compare and verify the five indicators of FPR, FNR, ACC, P and F1, respectively reaching 10.30%, 5.20%, 92.50%,85.10% and 85.40%,which shows that it can effectively reduce the false alarm rate of static analysis.

> The criminalization of poverty has been widely denounced as a collective bias against the most vulnerable. NGOs and international organizations claim that the poor are blamed for their situation, are more often associated with criminal offenses than the wealthy strata of society and even incur criminal offenses simply as a result of being poor. While no evidence has been found in the literature that correlates poverty and overall criminality rates, this paper offers evidence of a collective belief that associates both concepts. This brief report measures the societal bias that correlates criminality with the poor, as compared to the rich, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Twitter. The paper quantifies the level of crime-poverty bias in a panel of eight different English-speaking countries. The regional differences in the association between crime and poverty cannot be justified based on different levels of inequality or unemployment, which the literature correlates to property crimes. The variation in the observed rates of crime-poverty bias for different geographic locations could be influenced by cultural factors and the tendency to overestimate the equality of opportunities and social mobility in specific countries. These results have consequences for policy-making and open a new path of research for poverty mitigation with the focus not only on the poor but on society as a whole. Acting on the collective bias against the poor would facilitate the approval of poverty reduction policies, as well as the restoration of the dignity of the persons affected.

> The Simplified Access Metric (SAM) is a new approach for characterizing emergency shelter access patterns as a measure of shelter client vulnerability. The goal of SAM is to provide shelter operators with an intuitive way to understand access patterns that can be implemented by non-technical staff using spreadsheet operations. Client data from a large North American shelter will be used to demonstrate that SAM produces similar results to traditional transitional, episodic and chronic client cluster analysis. Since SAM requires less data than cluster analysis, it is also able to generate a real time picture of how shelter access patterns are affected by external factors. Timelines generated from nine years of shelter client data using SAM demonstrate the impact of Housing First programming and the COVID-19 lockdown on how people access shelter. Finally, SAM allows shelter staff to move beyond assigning transitional, episodic and chronic labels and instead use the "soft" output of SAM directly as a measure of vulnerability.

> Neural networks are vulnerable to a wide range of erroneous inputs such as adversarial, corrupted, out-of-distribution, and misclassified examples. In this work, we train a linear SVM classifier to detect these four types of erroneous data using hidden and softmax feature vectors of pre-trained neural networks. Our results indicate that these faulty data types generally exhibit linearly separable activation properties from correct examples, giving us the ability to reject bad inputs with no extra training or overhead. We experimentally validate our findings across a diverse range of datasets, domains, pre-trained models, and adversarial attacks.

> To enhance the efficiency of incident response triage operations, it is not cost-effective to defend all systems equally in a complex cyber environment. Instead, prioritizing the defense of critical functionality and the most vulnerable systems is desirable. Threat intelligence is crucial for guiding Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts' focus toward specific system activity and provides the primary contextual foundation for interpreting security alerts. This paper explores novel approaches for improving incident response triage operations, including dealing with attacks and zero-day malware. This solution for rapid prioritization of different malware have been raised to formulate fast response plans to minimize socioeconomic damage from the massive growth of malware attacks in recent years, it can also be extended to other incident response. We propose a malware triage approach that can rapidly classify and prioritize different malware classes to address this concern. We utilize a pre-trained ResNet18 network based on Siamese Neural Network (SNN) to reduce the biases in weights and parameters. Furthermore, our approach incorporates external task memory to retain the task information of previously encountered examples. This helps to transfer experience to new samples and reduces computational costs, without requiring backpropagation on external memory. Evaluation results indicate that the classification aspect of our proposed method surpasses other similar classification techniques in terms of performance. This new triage strategy based on task memory with meta-learning evaluates the level of similarity matching across malware classes to identify any risky and unknown malware (e.g., zero-day attacks) so that a defense of those that support critical functionality can be conducted.

> Embodied agents in vision navigation coupled with deep neural networks have attracted increasing attention. However, deep neural networks have been shown vulnerable to malicious adversarial noises, which may potentially cause catastrophic failures in Embodied Vision Navigation. Among different adversarial noises, universal adversarial perturbations (UAP), i.e., a constant image-agnostic perturbation applied on every input frame of the agent, play a critical role in Embodied Vision Navigation since they are computation-efficient and application-practical during the attack. However, existing UAP methods ignore the system dynamics of Embodied Vision Navigation and might be sub-optimal. In order to extend UAP to the sequential decision setting, we formulate the disturbed environment under the universal noise $\delta$, as a $\delta$-disturbed Markov Decision Process ($\delta$-MDP). Based on the formulation, we analyze the properties of $\delta$-MDP and propose two novel Consistent Attack methods, named Reward UAP and Trajectory UAP, for attacking Embodied agents, which consider the dynamic of the MDP and calculate universal noises by estimating the disturbed distribution and the disturbed Q function. For various victim models, our Consistent Attack can cause a significant drop in their performance in the PointGoal task in Habitat with different datasets and different scenes. Extensive experimental results indicate that there exist serious potential risks for applying Embodied Vision Navigation methods to the real world.

> Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) is one of the greatest growing technology for sensing and performing various tasks. The information transmitted in the WBSNs is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, therefore security is very important. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are considered one of the major threats against WBSNs security. In DoS attacks, an adversary targets to degrade and shut down the efficient use of the network and disrupt the services in the network causing them inaccessible to its intended users. If sensitive information of patients in WBSNs, such as the medical history is accessed by unauthorized users, the patient may suffer much more than the disease itself, it may result in loss of life. This paper proposes a User-Based authentication scheme to mitigate DoS attacks in WBSNs. A five-phase User-Based authentication DoS mitigation scheme for WBSNs is designed by integrating Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) to ensure a strong authentication process that will only allow authorized users to access nodes on WBSNs.

> The Internet of Things (IoT) is a futuristic technology that promises to connect tons of devices via the internet. As more individuals connect to the internet, it is believed that communication will generate mountains of data. IoT is currently leveraging Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to collect, monitor, and transmit data and sensitive data across wireless networks using sensor nodes. WSNs encounter a variety of threats posed by attackers, including unauthorized access and data security. Especially in the context of the Internet of Things, where small embedded devices with limited computational capabilities, such as sensor nodes, are expected to connect to a larger network. As a result, WSNs are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Furthermore, implementing security is time-consuming and selective, as traditional security algorithms degrade network performance due to their computational complexity and inherent delays. This paper describes an encryption algorithm that combines the Secure IoT (SIT) algorithm with the Security Protocols for Sensor Networks (SPINS) security protocol to create the Lightweight Security Algorithm (LSA), which addresses data security concerns while reducing power consumption in WSNs without sacrificing performance.

> Deep hashing has been extensively utilized in massive image retrieval because of its efficiency and effectiveness. However, deep hashing models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, making it essential to develop adversarial defense methods for image retrieval. Existing solutions achieved limited defense performance because of using weak adversarial samples for training and lacking discriminative optimization objectives to learn robust features. In this paper, we present a min-max based Center-guided Adversarial Training, namely CgAT, to improve the robustness of deep hashing networks through worst adversarial examples. Specifically, we first formulate the center code as a semantically-discriminative representative of the input image content, which preserves the semantic similarity with positive samples and dissimilarity with negative examples. We prove that a mathematical formula can calculate the center code immediately. After obtaining the center codes in each optimization iteration of the deep hashing network, they are adopted to guide the adversarial training process. On the one hand, CgAT generates the worst adversarial examples as augmented data by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of the adversarial examples and the center codes. On the other hand, CgAT learns to mitigate the effects of adversarial samples by minimizing the Hamming distance to the center codes. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial training algorithm in defending against adversarial attacks for deep hashing-based retrieval. Compared with the current state-of-the-art defense method, we significantly improve the defense performance by an average of 18.61\%, 12.35\%, and 11.56\% on FLICKR-25K, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO, respectively.

> In the field of high-energy physics, deep learning algorithms continue to gain in relevance and provide performance improvements over traditional methods, for example when identifying rare signals or finding complex patterns. From an analyst's perspective, obtaining highest possible performance is desirable, but recently, some attention has been shifted towards studying robustness of models to investigate how well these perform under slight distortions of input features. Especially for tasks that involve many (low-level) inputs, the application of deep neural networks brings new challenges. In the context of jet flavor tagging, adversarial attacks are used to probe a typical classifier's vulnerability and can be understood as a model for systematic uncertainties. A corresponding defense strategy, adversarial training, improves robustness, while maintaining high performance. Investigating the loss surface corresponding to the inputs and models in question reveals geometric interpretations of robustness, taking correlations into account.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may lead to catastrophe in security-critical domains. Numerous detection methods are proposed to characterize the feature uniqueness of adversarial examples, or to distinguish DNN's behavior activated by the adversarial examples. Detections based on features cannot handle adversarial examples with large perturbations. Besides, they require a large amount of specific adversarial examples. Another mainstream, model-based detections, which characterize input properties by model behaviors, suffer from heavy computation cost. To address the issues, we introduce the concept of local gradient, and reveal that adversarial examples have a quite larger bound of local gradient than the benign ones. Inspired by the observation, we leverage local gradient for detecting adversarial examples, and propose a general framework AdvCheck. Specifically, by calculating the local gradient from a few benign examples and noise-added misclassified examples to train a detector, adversarial examples and even misclassified natural inputs can be precisely distinguished from benign ones. Through extensive experiments, we have validated the AdvCheck's superior performance to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, with detection rate ($\sim \times 1.2$) on general adversarial attacks and ($\sim \times 1.4$) on misclassified natural inputs on average, with average 1/500 time cost. We also provide interpretable results for successful detection.

> The rise of cyber threats on critical infrastructure and its potential for devastating consequences, has significantly increased. The dependency of new power grid technology on information, data analytic and communication systems make the entire electricity network vulnerable to cyber threats. Power transformers play a critical role within the power grid and are now commonly enhanced through factory add-ons or intelligent monitoring systems added later to improve the condition monitoring of critical and long lead time assets such as transformers. However, the increased connectivity of those power transformers opens the door to more cyber attacks. Therefore, the need to detect and prevent cyber threats is becoming critical. The first step towards that would be a deeper understanding of the potential cyber-attacks landscape against power transformers. Much of the existing literature pays attention to smart equipment within electricity distribution networks, and most methods proposed are based on model-based detection algorithms. Moreover, only a few of these works address the security vulnerabilities of power elements, especially transformers within the transmission network. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study in the literature that systematically investigate the cybersecurity challenges against the newly emerged smart transformers. This paper addresses this shortcoming by exploring the vulnerabilities and the attack vectors of power transformers within electricity networks, the possible attack scenarios and the risks associated with these attacks.

> The paper 'Deep Learning on a Data Diet' by Paul et al. (2021) introduces two innovative metrics for pruning datasets during the training of neural networks. While we are able to replicate the results for the EL2N score at epoch 20, the same cannot be said for the GraNd score at initialization. The GraNd scores later in training provide useful pruning signals, however. The GraNd score at initialization calculates the average gradient norm of an input sample across multiple randomly initialized models before any training has taken place. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the GraNd score at initialization and the input norm of a sample, suggesting that the latter could have been a cheap new baseline for data pruning. Unfortunately, neither the GraNd score at initialization nor the input norm surpasses random pruning in performance. This contradicts one of the findings in Paul et al. (2021). We were unable to reproduce their CIFAR-10 results using both an updated version of the original JAX repository and in a newly implemented PyTorch codebase. An investigation of the underlying JAX/FLAX code from 2021 surfaced a bug in the checkpoint restoring code that was fixed in April 2021 (https://github.com/google/flax/commit/28fbd95500f4bf2f9924d2560062fa50e919b1a5).

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been utilized to create multi-layer graph models for a number of cybersecurity applications from fraud detection to software vulnerability analysis. Unfortunately, like traditional neural networks, GNNs also suffer from a lack of transparency, that is, it is challenging to interpret the model predictions. Prior works focused on specific factor explanations for a GNN model. In this work, we have designed and implemented Illuminati, a comprehensive and accurate explanation framework for cybersecurity applications using GNN models. Given a graph and a pre-trained GNN model, Illuminati is able to identify the important nodes, edges, and attributes that are contributing to the prediction while requiring no prior knowledge of GNN models. We evaluate Illuminati in two cybersecurity applications, i.e., code vulnerability detection and smart contract vulnerability detection. The experiments show that Illuminati achieves more accurate explanation results than state-of-the-art methods, specifically, 87.6% of subgraphs identified by Illuminati are able to retain their original prediction, an improvement of 10.3% over others at 77.3%. Furthermore, the explanation of Illuminati can be easily understood by the domain experts, suggesting the significant usefulness for the development of cybersecurity applications.

> Dynamic data flow analysis has been widely used to guide greybox fuzzing. However, traditional dynamic data flow analysis tends to go astray in the massive path tracking and requires to process a large volume of data, resulting in low efficiency in reaching the target location. In this paper, we propose a directed greybox fuzzer based on dynamic constraint filtering and focusing (CONFF). First, all path constraints are tracked, and those with high priority are filtered as the next solution targets. Next, focusing on a single path constraint to be satisfied, we obtain its data condition and probe the mapping relationship between it and the input bytes through multi-byte mapping and single-byte mapping. Finally, various mutation strategies are utilized to solve the path constraint currently focused on, and the target location of the program is gradually approached through path selection. The CONFF fuzzer can reach a specific location faster in the target program, thus efficiently triggering the crash. We designed and implemented a prototype of the CONFF fuzzer and evaluated it with the LAVA-1 dataset and some real-world vulnerabilities. The results show that the CONFF fuzzer can reproduce crashes on the LAVA-1 dataset and most of the real-world vulnerabilities. For most vulnerabilities, the CONFF fuzzer reproduced the crashes with significantly reduced time compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers. On average, the CONFF fuzzer was 23.7x faster than the state-of-the-art code coverage-based fuzzer Angora and 27.3x faster than the classical directed greybox fuzzer AFLGo.

> Recent studies reveal that Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can be manipulated by hidden backdoors, causing them to perform harmful actions when activated by physical triggers. However, it is still unclear how these triggers can be activated while adhering to traffic principles. Understanding this vulnerability in a dynamic traffic environment is crucial. This work addresses this gap by presenting physical trigger activation as a reachability problem of controlled dynamic system. Our technique identifies security-critical areas in traffic systems where trigger conditions for accidents can be reached, and provides intended trajectories for how those conditions can be reached. Testing on typical traffic scenarios showed the system can be successfully driven to trigger conditions with near 100% activation rate. Our method benefits from identifying AV vulnerability and enabling effective safety strategies.

> Deep neural networks are proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Detecting the trigger samples during the inference stage, i.e., the test-time trigger sample detection, can prevent the backdoor from being triggered. However, existing detection methods often require the defenders to have high accessibility to victim models, extra clean data, or knowledge about the appearance of backdoor triggers, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose the test-time corruption robustness consistency evaluation (TeCo), a novel test-time trigger sample detection method that only needs the hard-label outputs of the victim models without any extra information. Our journey begins with the intriguing observation that the backdoor-infected models have similar performance across different image corruptions for the clean images, but perform discrepantly for the trigger samples. Based on this phenomenon, we design TeCo to evaluate test-time robustness consistency by calculating the deviation of severity that leads to predictions' transition across different corruptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art defenses, which even require either certain information about the trigger types or accessibility of clean data, TeCo outperforms them on different backdoor attacks, datasets, and model architectures, enjoying a higher AUROC by 10% and 5 times of stability.

> Deep neural networks can be easily fooled into making incorrect predictions through corruption of the input by adversarial perturbations: human-imperceptible artificial noise. So far adversarial training has been the most successful defense against such adversarial attacks. This work focuses on improving adversarial training to boost adversarial robustness. We first analyze, from an instance-wise perspective, how adversarial vulnerability evolves during adversarial training. We find that during training an overall reduction of adversarial loss is achieved by sacrificing a considerable proportion of training samples to be more vulnerable to adversarial attack, which results in an uneven distribution of adversarial vulnerability among data. Such "uneven vulnerability", is prevalent across several popular robust training methods and, more importantly, relates to overfitting in adversarial training. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new adversarial training method: Instance-adaptive Smoothness Enhanced Adversarial Training (ISEAT). It jointly smooths both input and weight loss landscapes in an adaptive, instance-specific, way to enhance robustness more for those samples with higher adversarial vulnerability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing defense methods. Noticeably, our method, when combined with the latest data augmentation and semi-supervised learning techniques, achieves state-of-the-art robustness against $\ell_{\infty}$-norm constrained attacks on CIFAR10 of 59.32% for Wide ResNet34-10 without extra data, and 61.55% for Wide ResNet28-10 with extra data.

> Self-supervised representation learning techniques have been developing rapidly to make full use of unlabeled images. They encode images into rich features that are oblivious to downstream tasks. Behind their revolutionary representation power, the requirements for dedicated model designs and a massive amount of computation resources expose image encoders to the risks of potential model stealing attacks - a cheap way to mimic the well-trained encoder performance while circumventing the demanding requirements. Yet conventional attacks only target supervised classifiers given their predicted labels and/or posteriors, which leaves the vulnerability of unsupervised encoders unexplored.   In this paper, we first instantiate the conventional stealing attacks against encoders and demonstrate their severer vulnerability compared with downstream classifiers. To better leverage the rich representation of encoders, we further propose Cont-Steal, a contrastive-learning-based attack, and validate its improved stealing effectiveness in various experiment settings. As a takeaway, we appeal to our community's attention to the intellectual property protection of representation learning techniques, especially to the defenses against encoder stealing attacks like ours.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations-small changes crafted deliberately on the input to mislead the model for wrong predictions. Adversarial attacks have disastrous consequences for deep learning-empowered critical applications. Existing defense and detection techniques both require extensive knowledge of the model, testing inputs, and even execution details. They are not viable for general deep learning implementations where the model internal is unknown, a common 'black-box' scenario for model users. Inspired by the fact that electromagnetic (EM) emanations of a model inference are dependent on both operations and data and may contain footprints of different input classes, we propose a framework, EMShepherd, to capture EM traces of model execution, perform processing on traces and exploit them for adversarial detection. Only benign samples and their EM traces are used to train the adversarial detector: a set of EM classifiers and class-specific unsupervised anomaly detectors. When the victim model system is under attack by an adversarial example, the model execution will be different from executions for the known classes, and the EM trace will be different. We demonstrate that our air-gapped EMShepherd can effectively detect different adversarial attacks on a commonly used FPGA deep learning accelerator for both Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. It achieves a 100% detection rate on most types of adversarial samples, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art 'white-box' software-based detectors.

> Smart meter measurements, though critical for accurate demand forecasting, face several drawbacks including consumers' privacy, data breach issues, to name a few. Recent literature has explored Federated Learning (FL) as a promising privacy-preserving machine learning alternative which enables collaborative learning of a model without exposing private raw data for short term load forecasting. Despite its virtue, standard FL is still vulnerable to an intractable cyber threat known as Byzantine attack carried out by faulty and/or malicious clients. Therefore, to improve the robustness of federated short-term load forecasting against Byzantine threats, we develop a state-of-the-art differentially private secured FL-based framework that ensures the privacy of the individual smart meter's data while protect the security of FL models and architecture. Our proposed framework leverages the idea of gradient quantization through the Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent (SignSGD) algorithm, where the clients only transmit the `sign' of the gradient to the control centre after local model training. As we highlight through our experiments involving benchmark neural networks with a set of Byzantine attack models, our proposed approach mitigates such threats quite effectively and thus outperforms conventional Fed-SGD models.

> COVID19 and asthma are respiratory diseases that can be life threatening in uncontrolled circumstances and require continuous monitoring. A poverty stricken South Asian country like Bangladesh has been bearing the brunt of the COVID19 pandemic since its beginning. The majority of the country's population resides in rural areas, where proper healthcare is difficult to access. This emphasizes the necessity of telemedicine, implementing the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is still under development in Bangladesh. This paper demonstrates how the current challenges in the healthcare system are resolvable through the design of a remote health and environment monitoring system, specifically for asthma patients who are at an increased risk of COVID19. Since on-time treatment is essential, this system will allow doctors and medical staff to receive patient information in real time and deliver their services immediately to the patient regardless of their location. The proposed system consists of various sensors collecting heart rate, body temperature, ambient temperature, humidity, and air quality data and processing them through the Arduino Microcontroller. It is integrated with a mobile application. All this data is sent to the mobile application via a Bluetooth module and updated every few seconds so that the medical staff can instantly track patients' conditions and emergencies. The developed prototype is portable and easily usable by anyone. The system has been applied to five people of different ages and medical histories over a particular period. Upon analyzing all their data, it became clear which participants were particularly vulnerable to health deterioration and needed constant observation. Through this research, awareness about asthmatic symptoms will improve and help prevent their severity through effective treatment anytime, anywhere.

> Sponge examples are test-time inputs carefully optimized to increase energy consumption and latency of neural networks when deployed on hardware accelerators. In this work, we are the first to demonstrate that sponge examples can also be injected at training time, via an attack that we call sponge poisoning. This attack allows one to increase the energy consumption and latency of machine-learning models indiscriminately on each test-time input. We present a novel formalization for sponge poisoning, overcoming the limitations related to the optimization of test-time sponge examples, and show that this attack is possible even if the attacker only controls a few model updates; for instance, if model training is outsourced to an untrusted third-party or distributed via federated learning. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that sponge poisoning can almost completely vanish the effect of hardware accelerators. We also analyze the activations of poisoned models, identifying which components are more vulnerable to this attack. Finally, we examine the feasibility of countermeasures against sponge poisoning to decrease energy consumption, showing that sanitization methods may be overly expensive for most of the users.

- *Xiao Yang, Chang Liu, Longlong Xu, Yikai Wang, Yinpeng Dong, Ning Chen, Hang Su, Jun Zhu*

- `2303.15818v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15818v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15818v1)

> Face recognition is a prevailing authentication solution in numerous biometric applications. Physical adversarial attacks, as an important surrogate, can identify the weaknesses of face recognition systems and evaluate their robustness before deployed. However, most existing physical attacks are either detectable readily or ineffective against commercial recognition systems. The goal of this work is to develop a more reliable technique that can carry out an end-to-end evaluation of adversarial robustness for commercial systems. It requires that this technique can simultaneously deceive black-box recognition models and evade defensive mechanisms. To fulfill this, we design adversarial textured 3D meshes (AT3D) with an elaborate topology on a human face, which can be 3D-printed and pasted on the attacker's face to evade the defenses. However, the mesh-based optimization regime calculates gradients in high-dimensional mesh space, and can be trapped into local optima with unsatisfactory transferability. To deviate from the mesh-based space, we propose to perturb the low-dimensional coefficient space based on 3D Morphable Model, which significantly improves black-box transferability meanwhile enjoying faster search efficiency and better visual quality. Extensive experiments in digital and physical scenarios show that our method effectively explores the security vulnerabilities of multiple popular commercial services, including three recognition APIs, four anti-spoofing APIs, two prevailing mobile phones and two automated access control systems.

- `2303.15901v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15901v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15901v1)

> Adversarial attacks significantly threaten the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite the multiple defensive methods employed, they are nevertheless vulnerable to poison attacks, where attackers meddle with the initial training data. In order to defend DNNs against such adversarial attacks, this work proposes a novel method that combines the defensive distillation mechanism with a denoising autoencoder (DAE). This technique tries to lower the sensitivity of the distilled model to poison attacks by spotting and reconstructing poisonous adversarial inputs in the training data. We added carefully created adversarial samples to the initial training data to assess the proposed method's performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that our method successfully identified and reconstructed the poisonous inputs while also considering enhancing the DNN's resilience. The proposed approach provides a potent and robust defense mechanism for DNNs in various applications where data poisoning attacks are a concern. Thus, the defensive distillation technique's limitation posed by poisonous adversarial attacks is overcome.

- `2203.00219v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00219v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00219v2)

> As Smart Meters are collecting and transmitting household energy consumption data to Retail Energy Providers (REP), the main challenge is to ensure the effective use of fine-grained consumer data while ensuring data privacy. In this manuscript, we tackle this challenge for energy load consumption forecasting in regards to REPs which is essential to energy demand management, load switching and infrastructure development. Specifically, we note that existing energy load forecasting is centralized, which are not scalable and most importantly, vulnerable to data privacy threats. Besides, REPs are individual market participants and liable to ensure the privacy of their own customers. To address this issue, we propose a novel horizontal privacy-preserving federated learning framework for REPs energy load forecasting, namely FedREP. We consider a federated learning system consisting of a control centre and multiple retailers by enabling multiple REPs to build a common, robust machine learning model without sharing data, thus addressing critical issues such as data privacy, data security and scalability. For forecasting, we use a state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network due to its ability to learn long term sequences of observations and promises of higher accuracy with time-series data while solving the vanishing gradient problem. Finally, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using a real energy consumption dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed federated learning framework can achieve sufficient performance in terms of MSE ranging between 0.3 to 0.4 and is relatively similar to that of a centralized approach while preserving privacy and improving scalability.

> Speaker verification has been widely used in many authentication scenarios. However, training models for speaker verification requires large amounts of data and computing power, so users often use untrustworthy third-party data or deploy third-party models directly, which may create security risks. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack for the above scenario. Specifically, for the Siamese network in the speaker verification system, we try to implant a universal identity in the model that can simulate any enrolled speaker and pass the verification. So the attacker does not need to know the victim, which makes the attack more flexible and stealthy. In addition, we design and compare three ways of selecting attacker utterances and two ways of poisoned training for the GE2E loss function in different scenarios. The results on the TIMIT and Voxceleb1 datasets show that our approach can achieve a high attack success rate while guaranteeing the normal verification accuracy. Our work reveals the vulnerability of the speaker verification system and provides a new perspective to further improve the robustness of the system.

> Vertical federated learning (VFL) enables a service provider (i.e., active party) who owns labeled features to collaborate with passive parties who possess auxiliary features to improve model performance. Existing VFL approaches, however, have two major vulnerabilities when passive parties unexpectedly quit in the deployment phase of VFL - severe performance degradation and intellectual property (IP) leakage of the active party's labels. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Party-wise Dropout} to improve the VFL model's robustness against the unexpected exit of passive parties and a defense method called \textbf{DIMIP} to protect the active party's IP in the deployment phase. We evaluate our proposed methods on multiple datasets against different inference attacks. The results show that Party-wise Dropout effectively maintains model performance after the passive party quits, and DIMIP successfully disguises label information from the passive party's feature extractor, thereby mitigating IP leakage.

> Software vulnerabilities can have serious consequences, which is why many techniques have been proposed to defend against them. Among these, vulnerability detection techniques are a major area of focus. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive approach for benchmarking these proposed techniques. In this paper, we present the first survey that comprehensively investigates and summarizes the current state of software vulnerability detection benchmarking. We review the current literature on benchmarking vulnerability detection, including benchmarking approaches in technique-proposing papers and empirical studies. We also separately discuss the benchmarking approaches for traditional and deep learning-based vulnerability detection techniques. Our survey analyzes the challenges of benchmarking software vulnerability detection techniques and the difficulties involved. We summarize the challenges of benchmarking software vulnerability detection techniques and describe possible solutions for addressing these challenges.

> The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming ubiquitous in our daily life. IoT networks that are made up of devices low power, low memory, and low computing capability appears in many applications such as healthcare, home, agriculture. IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Network (RPL) has become a standardized routing protocol for such low-power and lossy networks in IoT. RPL establishes the best routes between devices according to the requirements of the application, which is achieved by the Objective Function (OF). Even though some security mechanisms are defined for external attackers in its RFC, RPL is vulnerable to attacks coming from inside. Moreover, the same attacks could has different impacts on networks with different OFs. Therefore, an analysis of such attacks becomes important in order to develop suitable security solutions for RPL. This study analyze RPL-specific attacks on networks using RPL's default OFs, namely Objective Function Zero (OF0) and the Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function (MRHOF). Moreover, mobile attackers could affect more nodes in a network due to their mobility. While the security solutions proposed in the literature assume that the network is static, this study takes into account mobile attackers.

> Distributed ledger systems have become more prominent and successful in recent years, with a focus on blockchains and cryptocurrency. This has led to various misunderstandings about both the technology itself and its capabilities, as in many cases blockchain and cryptocurrency is used synonymously and other applications are often overlooked. Therefore, as a whole, the view of distributed ledger technology beyond blockchains and cryptocurrencies is very limited. Existing vocabularies and ontologies often focus on single aspects of the technology, or in some cases even just on one product. This potentially leads to other types of distributed ledgers and their possible use cases being neglected. In this paper, we present a knowledge graph and an ontology for distributed ledger technologies, which includes security considerations to model aspects such as threats and vulnerabilities, application domains, as well as relevant standards and regulations. Such a knowledge graph improves the overall understanding of distributed ledgers, reveals their strengths, and supports the work of security personnel, i.e. analysts and system architects. We discuss potential uses and follow semantic web best practices to evaluate and publish the ontology and knowledge graph.

> Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), with a form factor of 10cm in diameter, are an emerging technology thanks to the broad applicability enabled by their onboard intelligence. However, these platforms are strongly limited in the onboard power envelope for processing, i.e., less than a few hundred mW, which confines the onboard processors to the class of simple microcontroller units (MCUs). These MCUs lack advanced security features opening the way to a wide range of cyber security vulnerabilities, from the communication between agents of the same fleet to the onboard execution of malicious code. This work presents an open source System on Chip (SoC) design that integrates a 64 bit Linux capable host processor accelerated by an 8 core 32 bit parallel programmable accelerator. The heterogeneous system architecture is coupled with a security enclave based on an open source OpenTitan root of trust. To demonstrate our design, we propose a use case where OpenTitan detects a security breach on the SoC aboard the MAV and drives its exclusive GPIOs to start a LED blinking routine. This procedure embodies an unconventional visual communication between two palm sized MAVs: the receiver MAV classifies the LED state of the sender (on or off) with an onboard convolutional neural network running on the parallel accelerator. Then, it reconstructs a high-level message in 1.3s, 2.3 times faster than current commercial solutions.

> The presence of software vulnerabilities is an ever-growing issue in software development. In most cases, it is desirable to detect vulnerabilities as early as possible, preferably in a just-in-time manner, when the vulnerable piece is added to the code base. The industry has a hard time combating this problem as manual inspection is costly and traditional means, such as rule-based bug detection, are not robust enough to follow the pace of the emergence of new vulnerabilities. The actively researched field of machine learning could help in such situations as models can be trained to detect vulnerable patterns. However, machine learning models work well only if the data is appropriately represented. In our work, we propose a novel way of representing changes in source code (i.e. code commits), the Code Change Tree, a form that is designed to keep only the differences between two abstract syntax trees of Java source code. We compared its effectiveness in predicting if a code change introduces a vulnerability against multiple representation types and evaluated them by a number of machine learning models as a baseline. The evaluation is done on a novel dataset that we published as part of our contributions using a 2-phase dataset generator method. Based on our evaluation we concluded that using Code Change Tree is a valid and effective choice to represent source code changes as it improves performance.

Existing federated learning approaches either use (i) secure multiparty computation (SMC) which is vulnerable to inference or (ii) differential privacy which may decrease the test accuracy given a large number of parties with relatively small amounts of data each. To tackle the problem with the existing methods in the literature, In this paper, we introduce incorporate federated learning in the inner-working of MIMO systems.

> The participation of third-party entities in the globalized semiconductor supply chain introduces potential security vulnerabilities, such as intellectual property piracy and hardware Trojan (HT) insertion. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been employed to address various hardware security threats, owing to their superior performance on graph-structured data, such as circuits. However, GNNs are also susceptible to attacks. This work examines the use of GNNs for detecting hardware threats like HTs and their vulnerability to attacks. We present BadGNN, a backdoor attack on GNNs that can hide HTs and evade detection with a 100% success rate through minor circuit perturbations. Our findings highlight the need for further investigation into the security and robustness of GNNs before they can be safely used in security-critical applications.

> Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are used for securing electronic devices across the implementation spectrum ranging from Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to system on chips (SoCs). However, existing PUF implementations often suffer from one or more significant deficiencies: (1) significant design overhead; (2) difficulty to configure and integrate based on application-specific requirements; (3) vulnerability to model-building attacks; and (4) spatial locality to a specific region of a chip. These factors limit their application in the authentication of designs used in diverse applications. In this work, we propose MeLPUF: Memory-in-Logic PUF; a low-overhead, distributed PUF that leverages the existing logic gates in a design to create cross-coupled inverters (i.e., memory cells) in a logic circuit as an entropy source. It exploits these memory cells' power-up states as the entropy source to generate device-specific unique fingerprints. A dedicated control signal governs these on-demand memory cells. They can be dispersed across the combinational logic of a design to achieve distributed authentication. They can also be synthesized with a standard logic synthesis tool to meet the target area, power, and performance constraints. We evaluate the quality of MeLPUF signatures with circuit-level simulations and experimental measurements using FPGA silicon (TSMC 55nm process). Our analysis shows the high quality of the PUF in terms of uniqueness, randomness, and robustness while incurring modest overhead. We further demonstrate the scalability of MeLPUF by aggregating power-up states from multiple memory cells, thus creating PUF signatures or digital identifiers of varying lengths. Additionally, we suggest optimization techniques that can be leveraged to boost the performance of MeLPUF further.

> In this work, we present a data poisoning attack that confounds machine learning models without any manipulation of the image or label. This is achieved by simply leveraging the most confounding natural samples found within the training data itself, in a new form of a targeted attack coined "Mole Recruitment." We define moles as the training samples of a class that appear most similar to samples of another class, and show that simply restructuring training batches with an optimal number of moles can lead to significant degradation in the performance of the targeted class. We show the efficacy of this novel attack in an offline setting across several standard image classification datasets, and demonstrate the real-world viability of this attack in a continual learning (CL) setting. Our analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are susceptible to Mole Recruitment, thereby exposing a previously undetected vulnerability of image classifiers.

> In this paper we propose a novel way of deploying vulnerable architectures for defense and research purposes, which aims to generate deception platforms based on the formal description of a scenario. An attack scenario is described by an attack graph in which transitions are labeled by ATT&CK techniques or procedures. The state of the attacker is modeled as a set of secrets he acquires and a set of nodes he controls. Descriptions of a single scenario on a technical level can then be declined into several different scenarios on a procedural level, and each of these scenarios can be deployed into its own vulnerable architecture. To achieve this goal we introduce the notion of architecture constraints, as some procedures may only be exploited on system presenting special properties, such as having a specific operating system version. Finally, we present our deployment process for converting one of these scenarios into a vulnerable infrastructure, and offer an online proof of concept demonstration of our tool, where readers may deploy locally deploy a complete scenario inspired by the threat actor APT-29.

> The complexity of modern software has led to a drastic increase in the time and cost associated with detecting and rectifying software bugs. In response, researchers have explored various methods to automatically generate fixes for buggy code. However, due to the large combinatorial space of possible fixes for any given bug, few tools and datasets are available to evaluate model-generated fixes effectively. To address this issue, we introduce FixEval, a benchmark comprising of buggy code submissions to competitive programming problems and their corresponding fixes. FixEval offers an extensive collection of unit tests to evaluate the correctness of model-generated program fixes and assess further information regarding time, memory constraints, and acceptance based on a verdict. We consider two Transformer language models pretrained on programming languages as our baseline and compare them using match-based and execution-based evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that match-based metrics do not reflect model-generated program fixes accurately. At the same time, execution-based methods evaluate programs through all cases and scenarios designed explicitly for that solution. Therefore, we believe FixEval provides a step towards real-world automatic bug fixing and model-generated code evaluation. The dataset and models are open-sourced at https://github.com/mahimanzum/FixEval.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial geometric transformation. This paper aims to verify the robustness of large-scale DNNs against the combination of multiple geometric transformations with a provable guarantee. Given a set of transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, etc.), we develop GeoRobust, a black-box robustness analyser built upon a novel global optimisation strategy, for locating the worst-case combination of transformations that affect and even alter a network's output. GeoRobust can provide provable guarantees on finding the worst-case combination based on recent advances in Lipschitzian theory. Due to its black-box nature, GeoRobust can be deployed on large-scale DNNs regardless of their architectures, activation functions, and the number of neurons. In practice, GeoRobust can locate the worst-case geometric transformation with high precision for the ResNet50 model on ImageNet in a few seconds on average. We examined 18 ImageNet classifiers, including the ResNet family and vision transformers, and found a positive correlation between the geometric robustness of the networks and the parameter numbers. We also observe that increasing the depth of DNN is more beneficial than increasing its width in terms of improving its geometric robustness. Our tool GeoRobust is available at https://github.com/TrustAI/GeoRobust.

> Neural networks have been proven to be both highly effective within computer vision, and highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Consequently, as the use of neural networks increases due to their unrivaled performance, so too does the threat posed by adversarial attacks. In this work, we build towards addressing the challenge of adversarial robustness by exploring the relationship between the mini-batch size used during adversarial sample generation and the strength of the adversarial samples produced. We demonstrate that an increase in mini-batch size results in a decrease in the efficacy of the samples produced, and we draw connections between these observations and the phenomenon of vanishing gradients. Next, we formulate loss functions such that adversarial sample strength is not degraded by mini-batch size. Our findings highlight a potential risk for underestimating the true (practical) strength of adversarial attacks, and a risk of overestimating a model's robustness. We share our codes to let others replicate our experiments and to facilitate further exploration of the connections between batch size and adversarial sample strength.

Deep learning models, however, are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Though there are many studies on the model robustness in the context of standard supervised learning, protecting continual learning from adversarial attacks has not yet been investigated. To fill in this research gap, we are the first to study adversarial robustness in continual learning and propose a novel method called \textbf{T}ask-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{B}oundary \textbf{A}ugmentation (TABA) to boost the robustness of continual learning models.

> Technical debt occurs in many different forms across software artifacts. One such form is connected to software architectures where debt emerges in the form of structural anti-patterns across architecture elements, namely, architecture smells. As defined in the literature, ``Architecture smells are recurrent architectural decisions that negatively impact internal system quality", thus increasing technical debt. In this paper, we aim at exploring whether there exist manifestations of architectural technical debt beyond decreased code or architectural quality, namely, whether there is a relation between architecture smells (which primarily reflect structural characteristics) and the occurrence of concurrency bugs (which primarily manifest at runtime). We study 125 releases of 5 large data-intensive software systems to reveal that (1) several architecture smells may in fact indicate the presence of concurrency problems likely to manifest at runtime but (2) smells are not correlated with concurrency in general -- rather, for specific concurrency bugs they must be combined with an accompanying articulation of specific project characteristics such as project distribution. As an example, a cyclic dependency could be present in the code, but the specific execution-flow could be never executed at runtime.

> Cloud FPGAs strike an alluring balance between computational efficiency, energy efficiency, and cost. It is the flexibility of the FPGA architecture that enables these benefits, but that very same flexibility that exposes new security vulnerabilities. We show that a remote attacker can recover "FPGA pentimenti" - long-removed secret data belonging to a prior user of a cloud FPGA. The sensitive data constituting an FPGA pentimento is an analog imprint from bias temperature instability (BTI) effects on the underlying transistors. We demonstrate how this slight degradation can be measured using a time-to-digital (TDC) converter when an adversary programs one into the target cloud FPGA.   This technique allows an attacker to ascertain previously safe information on cloud FPGAs, even after it is no longer explicitly present. Notably, it can allow an attacker who knows a non-secret "skeleton" (the physical structure, but not the contents) of the victim's design to (1) extract proprietary details from an encrypted FPGA design image available on the AWS marketplace and (2) recover data loaded at runtime by a previous user of a cloud FPGA using a known design. Our experiments show that BTI degradation (burn-in) and recovery are measurable and constitute a security threat to commercial cloud FPGAs.

> A blind spot is any input to a program that can be arbitrarily mutated without affecting the program's output. Blind spots can be used for steganography or to embed malware payloads. If blind spots overlap file format keywords, they indicate parsing bugs that can lead to exploitable differentials. For example, one could craft a document that renders one way in one viewer and a completely different way in another viewer. They have also been used to circumvent code signing in Android binaries, to coerce certificate authorities to misbehave, and to execute HTTP request smuggling and parameter pollution attacks. This paper formalizes the operational semantics of blind spots, leading to a technique based on dynamic information flow tracking that automatically detects blind spots. An efficient implementation is introduced and evaluated against a corpus of over a thousand diverse PDFs parsed through MuPDF, revealing exploitable bugs in the parser. All of the blind spot classifications are confirmed to be correct and the missed detection rate is no higher than 11%. On average, at least 5% of each PDF file is completely ignored by the parser. Our results show promise that this technique is an efficient automated means to detect exploitable parser bugs, over-permissiveness and differentials. Nothing in the technique is tied to PDF in general, so it can be immediately applied to other notoriously difficult-to-parse formats like ELF, X.509, and XML.

> Modern Building Automation Systems (BASs), as the brain that enables the smartness of a smart building, often require increased connectivity both among system components as well as with outside entities, such as optimized automation via outsourced cloud analytics and increased building-grid integrations. However, increased connectivity and accessibility come with increased cyber security threats. BASs were historically developed as closed environments with limited cyber-security considerations. As a result, BASs in many buildings are vulnerable to cyber-attacks that may cause adverse consequences, such as occupant discomfort, excessive energy usage, and unexpected equipment downtime. Therefore, there is a strong need to advance the state-of-the-art in cyber-physical security for BASs and provide practical solutions for attack mitigation in buildings. However, an inclusive and systematic review of BAS vulnerabilities, potential cyber-attacks with impact assessment, detection & defense approaches, and cyber-secure resilient control strategies is currently lacking in the literature. This review paper fills the gap by providing a comprehensive up-to-date review of cyber-physical security for BASs at three levels in commercial buildings: management level, automation level, and field level. The general BASs vulnerabilities and protocol-specific vulnerabilities for the four dominant BAS protocols are reviewed, followed by a discussion on four attack targets and seven potential attack scenarios. The impact of cyber-attacks on BASs is summarized as signal corruption, signal delaying, and signal blocking. The typical cyber-attack detection and defense approaches are identified at the three levels. Cyber-secure resilient control strategies for BASs under attack are categorized into passive and active resilient control schemes. Open challenges and future opportunities are finally discussed.

> The surge in the internet of things (IoT) devices seriously threatens the current IoT security landscape, which requires a robust network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Despite superior detection accuracy, existing machine learning or deep learning based NIDS are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a prevailing method in adversarial examples crafting. However, the nature of discrete network traffic at the packet level makes it hard for GAN to craft adversarial traffic as GAN is efficient in generating continuous data like image synthesis. Unlike previous methods that convert discrete network traffic into a grayscale image, this paper gains inspiration from SeqGAN in sequence generation with policy gradient. Based on the structure of SeqGAN, we propose Attack-GAN to generate adversarial network traffic at packet level that complies with domain constraints. Specifically, the adversarial packet generation is formulated into a sequential decision making process. In this case, each byte in a packet is regarded as a token in a sequence. The objective of the generator is to select a token to maximize its expected end reward. To bypass the detection of NIDS, the generated network traffic and benign traffic are classified by a black-box NIDS. The prediction results returned by the NIDS are fed into the discriminator to guide the update of the generator. We generate malicious adversarial traffic based on a real public available dataset with attack functionality unchanged. The experimental results validate that the generated adversarial samples are able to deceive many existing black-box NIDS.

> The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in a significant increase in research on e-health. As the amount of patient data grows, it has become increasingly challenging to protect patients' privacy. Patient data is commonly stored in the cloud, making it difficult for users to control and protect their information. Moreover, the recent rise in security and surveillance breaches in the healthcare industry has highlighted the need for a better approach to data storage and protection. Traditional models that rely on third-party control over patients' healthcare data are no longer reliable, as they have proven vulnerable to security breaches. To address these issues, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution. Blockchain-based protocols have the potential to provide a secure and efficient system for e-health applications that does not require trust in third-party intermediaries. The proposed protocol outlined in this paper uses a blockchain-based approach to manage patient data securely and efficiently. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily used for financial transactions, the protocol described here is designed specifically for e-health applications. It employs a consensus mechanism that is more suitable for resource constrained IoT devices, thereby reducing network costs and increasing efficiency. The proposed protocol also provides a privacy-preserving access control mechanism that enables patients to have more control over their healthcare data. By leveraging blockchain technology, the protocol ensures that only authorized individuals can access the patient's data, which helps prevent data breaches and other security issues. Finally, the security and privacy of the proposed protocol are analysed to ensure that it meets the necessary standards for data protection.

> Building a natural language dataset requires caution since word semantics is vulnerable to subtle text change or the definition of the annotated concept. Such a tendency can be seen in generative tasks like question-answering and dialogue generation and also in tasks that create a categorization-based corpus, like topic classification or sentiment analysis. Open-domain conversations involve two or more crowdworkers freely conversing about any topic, and collecting such data is particularly difficult for two reasons: 1) the dataset should be ``crafted" rather than ``obtained" due to privacy concerns, and 2) paid creation of such dialogues may differ from how crowdworkers behave in real-world settings. In this study, we tackle these issues when creating a large-scale open-domain persona dialogue corpus, where persona implies that the conversation is performed by several actors with a fixed persona and user-side workers from an unspecified crowd.

> The NPM package repository contains over two million packages and serves tens of billions of downloads per-week. Nearly every single JavaScript application uses the NPM package manager to install packages from the NPM repository. NPM relies on a "semantic versioning" ('semver') scheme to maintain a healthy ecosystem, where bug-fixes are reliably delivered to downstream packages as quickly as possible, while breaking changes require manual intervention by downstream package maintainers. In order to understand how developers use semver, we build a dataset containing every version of every package on NPM and analyze the flow of updates throughout the ecosystem. We build a time-travelling dependency resolver for NPM, which allows us to determine precisely which versions of each dependency would have been resolved at different times. We segment our analysis to allow for a direct analysis of security-relevant updates (those that introduce or patch vulnerabilities) in comparison to the rest of the ecosystem. We find that when developers use semver correctly, critical updates such as security patches can flow quite rapidly to downstream dependencies in the majority of cases (90.09%), but this does not always occur, due to developers' imperfect use of both semver version constraints and semver version number increments. Our findings have implications for developers and researchers alike. We make our infrastructure and dataset publicly available under an open source license.

> To ensure that the data collected from human subjects is entrusted with a secret, rival labels are introduced to conceal the information provided by the participants on purpose. The corresponding learning task can be formulated as a noisy partial-label learning problem. However, conventional partial-label learning (PLL) methods are still vulnerable to the high ratio of noisy partial labels, especially in a large labelling space. To learn a more robust model, we present Adversary-Aware Partial Label Learning and introduce the $\textit{rival}$, a set of noisy labels, to the collection of candidate labels for each instance. By introducing the rival label, the predictive distribution of PLL is factorised such that a handy predictive label is achieved with less uncertainty coming from the transition matrix, assuming the rival generation process is known. Nonetheless, the predictive accuracy is still insufficient to produce an sufficiently accurate positive sample set to leverage the clustering effect of the contrastive loss function. Moreover, the inclusion of rivals also brings an inconsistency issue for the classifier and risk function due to the intractability of the transition matrix. Consequently, an adversarial teacher within momentum (ATM) disambiguation algorithm is proposed to cope with the situation, allowing us to obtain a provably consistent classifier and risk function. In addition, our method has shown high resiliency to the choice of the label noise transition matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves promising results on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and CUB200 datasets.

> An ever-growing number of vulnerabilities are reported every day. Yet these vulnerabilities are not all the same; Some are more targeted than others. Correctly estimating the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited is a critical task for system administrators. This aids the system administrators in prioritizing and patching the right vulnerabilities. Our work makes use of outlier detection techniques to predict vulnerabilities that are likely to be exploited in highly imbalanced and high-dimensional datasets such as the National Vulnerability Database. We propose a dimensionality reduction technique, OutCenTR, that enhances the baseline outlier detection models. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OutCenTR empirically with 4 benchmark and 12 synthetic datasets. The results of our experiments show on average a 5-fold improvement of F1 score in comparison with state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and GRP.

> The software engineering community is facing challenges from quantum computers (QCs). In the era of quantum computing, Shor's algorithm running on QCs can break asymmetric encryption algorithms that classical computers practically cannot. Though the exact date when QCs will become "dangerous" for practical problems is unknown, the consensus is that this future is near. Thus, the software engineering community needs to start making software ready for quantum attacks and ensure quantum safety proactively.   We argue that the problem of evolving existing software to quantum-safe software is very similar to the Y2K bug. Thus, we leverage some best practices from the Y2K bug and propose our roadmap, called 7E, which gives developers a structured way to prepare for quantum attacks. It is intended to help developers start planning for the creation of new software and the evolution of cryptography in existing software.   In this paper, we use a case study to validate the viability of 7E. Our software under study is the IBM Db2 database system. We upgrade the current cryptographic schemes to post-quantum cryptographic ones (using Kyber and Dilithium schemes) and report our findings and lessons learned.   We show that the 7E roadmap effectively plans the evolution of existing software security features towards quantum safety, but it does require minor revisions. We incorporate our experience with IBM Db2 into the revised 7E roadmap.   The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology is finalizing the post-quantum cryptographic standard. The software engineering community needs to start getting prepared for the quantum advantage era. We hope that our experiential study with IBM Db2 and the 7E roadmap will help the community prepare existing software for quantum attacks in a structured manner.

> The growth in the use of small sensor devices, commonly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has resulted in unprecedented amounts of data being generated and captured. With the rapidly growing popularity of personal IoT devices, the collection of personal data through such devices has also increased exponentially. To accommodate the anticipated growth in connected devices, researchers are now investigating futuristic network technologies that are capable of processing large volumes of information at much faster speeds. However, the introduction of innovative network technologies coupled with existing vulnerabilities of personal IoT devices and insufficient device security standards is resulting in new challenges for the security of data collected on these devices. While existing research has focused on the technical aspects of security vulnerabilities and solutions in either network or IoT technologies separately, this paper thoroughly investigates common aspects impacting IoT security on existing and futuristic networks, including human-centric issues and the mechanisms that can lead to loss of confidentiality. By undertaking a comprehensive literature review of existing research, this article has identified five key areas that impact IoT security for futuristic next generation networks. Furthermore, by extensively analysing each area, the article reports on conclusive findings and future research opportunities for IoT privacy and security for the next generation of network technologies.

> Developers relax restrictions on a type to reuse methods with other types. While type casts are prevalent, in weakly typed languages such as C++, they are also extremely permissive. Assignments where a source expression is cast into a new type and assigned to a target variable of the new type, can lead to software bugs if performed without care. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to identify poor implementations of explicit cast operations. Our approach measures accord between the source expression and the target variable using conditional entropy. We collect casts from 34 components of the Chromium project, which collectively account for 27MLOC and random-uniformly sample this dataset to create a manually labelled dataset of 271 casts. Information-theoretic vetting of these 271 casts achieves a peak precision of 81% and a recall of 90%. We additionally present the findings of an in-depth investigation of notable explicit casts, two of which were fixed in recent releases of the Chromium project.

> Recently, we can notice a transition to data-driven techniques in Automated Program Repair (APR), in particular towards deep neural networks. This entails training on hundreds of thousands or even millions of non-executable code fragments. We would like to bring more attention to an aspect of code often neglected in Neural Program Repair (NPR), namely its execution. Code execution has several significant advantages. It allows for test-based evaluation of candidate fixes and can provide valuable information to aid repair. In this work we present a fully executable dataset of 450,000 small buggy/fixed program pairs originally submitted to programming competition websites written in eight different programming languages. Along with the dataset we provide infrastructure to compile, safely execute and test programs as well as fine-grained bug-type labels. To give a point of reference, we provide basic evaluation results for two baselines, one based on a generate-and-validate approach and one on deep learning. With this dataset we follow several goals: we want to lift Neural Program Repair beyond fully static code representations, foster the use of execution-based features and, by including several different languages, counterbalance the predominance of Java in the current landscape of APR datasets and benchmarks.

> \textit{Intelligent Navigation Systems} (INS) are exposed to an increasing number of informational attack vectors, which often intercept through the communication channels between the INS and the transportation network during the data collecting process. To measure the resilience of INS, we use the concept of a Wardrop Non-Equilibrium Solution (WANES), which is characterized by the probabilistic outcome of learning within a bounded number of interactions. By using concentration arguments, we have discovered that any bounded feedback delaying attack only degrades the systematic performance up to order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{{d^3}{T^{-1}}})$ along the traffic flow trajectory within the Delayed Mirror Descent (DMD) online-learning framework. This degradation in performance can occur with only mild assumptions imposed. Our result implies that learning-based INS infrastructures can achieve Wardrop Non-equilibrium even when experiencing a certain period of disruption in the information structure. These findings provide valuable insights for designing defense mechanisms against possible jamming attacks across different layers of the transportation ecosystem.

> Software obfuscation plays a crucial role in protecting intellectual property in software from reverse engineering attempts. While some obfuscation techniques originate from the obfuscation-reverse engineering arms race, others stem from different research areas, such as binary software exploitation. Return-oriented programming (ROP) gained popularity as one of the most effective exploitation techniques for memory error vulnerabilities. ROP interferes with our natural perception of a process control flow, inspiring us to repurpose ROP as a robust and effective form of software obfuscation. Although previous work already explores ROP's effectiveness as an obfuscation technique, evolving reverse engineering research raises the need for principled reasoning to understand the strengths and limitations of ROP-based mechanisms against man-at-the-end (MATE) attacks. To this end, we present ROPfuscator, a compiler-driven obfuscation pass based on ROP for any programming language supported by LLVM. We incorporate opaque predicates and constants and a novel instruction hiding technique to withstand sophisticated MATE attacks. More importantly, we introduce a realistic and unified threat model to thoroughly evaluate ROPfuscator and provide principled reasoning on ROP-based obfuscation techniques that answer to code coverage, incurred overhead, correctness, robustness, and practicality challenges.

> Java (de)serialization is prone to causing security-critical vulnerabilities that attackers can invoke existing methods (gadgets) on the application's classpath to construct a gadget chain to perform malicious behaviors. Several techniques have been proposed to statically identify suspicious gadget chains and dynamically generate injection objects for fuzzing. However, due to their incomplete support for dynamic program features (e.g., Java runtime polymorphism) and ineffective injection object generation for fuzzing, the existing techniques are still far from satisfactory.   In this paper, we first performed an empirical study to investigate the characteristics of Java deserialization vulnerabilities based on our manually collected 86 publicly known gadget chains. The empirical results show that 1) Java deserialization gadgets are usually exploited by abusing runtime polymorphism, which enables attackers to reuse serializable overridden methods; and 2) attackers usually invoke exploitable overridden methods (gadgets) via dynamic binding to generate injection objects for gadget chain construction. Based on our empirical findings, we propose a novel gadget chain mining approach, \emph{GCMiner}, which captures both explicit and implicit method calls to identify more gadget chains, and adopts an overriding-guided object generation approach to generate valid injection objects for fuzzing. The evaluation results show that \emph{GCMiner} significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, and discovers 56 unique gadget chains that cannot be identified by the baseline approaches.

> Static analysis tools come in many forms andconfigurations, allowing them to handle various tasks in a (secure) development process: code style linting, bug/vulnerability detection, verification, etc., and adapt to the specific requirements of a software project, thus reducing the number of false positives.The wide range of configuration options poses a hurdle in their use for software developers, as the tools cannot be deployed out-of-the-box. However, static analysis tools only develop their full benefit if they are integrated into the software development workflow and used on regular. Vulnerability management should be integrated via version history to identify hotspots, for example. We present an analysis platform that integrates several static analysis tools that enable Git-based repositories to continuously monitor warnings across their version history. The framework is easily extensible with other tools and programming languages. We provide a visualization component in the form of a dashboard to display security trends and hotspots. Our tool can also be used to create a database of security alerts at a scale well-suited for machine learning applications such as bug or vulnerability detection.

This paper discusses efforts towards characterizing the IoT software update landscape through network-level analysis of IoT device traffic. Our results suggest that vendors do not currently follow security best practices, and that software update standards, while available, are not being deployed.

> The Electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical cardiac activity generated by the heart to detect abnormal heartbeat and heart attack. However, the irregular occurrence of the abnormalities demands continuous monitoring of heartbeats. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to automate the task to reduce labor work needed during monitoring. In recent years, many companies have launched products with ECG monitoring and irregular heartbeat alert. Among all classification algorithms, the time series-based algorithm dynamic time warping (DTW) is widely adopted to undertake the ECG classification task. Though progress has been achieved, the DTW-based ECG classification also brings a new attacking vector of leaking the patients' diagnosis results. This paper shows that the ECG input samples' labels can be stolen via a side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. In particular, we first identify the vulnerability of DTW for ECG classification, i.e., the correlation between warping path choice and prediction results. Then we implement an attack that leverages Flush+Reload to monitor the warping path selection with known ECG data and then build a predictor for constructing the relation between warping path selection and labels of input ECG samples. Based on experiments, we find that the Flush+Reload-based inference leakage can achieve an 84.0\% attacking success rate to identify the labels of the two samples in DTW.

- `2304.02014v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02014v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02014v1)

> Deep Learning (DL) library bugs affect downstream DL applications, emphasizing the need for reliable systems. Generating valid input programs for fuzzing DL libraries is challenging due to the need for satisfying both language syntax/semantics and constraints for constructing valid computational graphs. Recently, the TitanFuzz work demonstrates that modern Large Language Models (LLMs) can be directly leveraged to implicitly learn all the constraints to generate valid DL programs for fuzzing. However, LLMs tend to generate ordinary programs following similar patterns seen in their massive training corpora, while fuzzing favors unusual inputs that cover edge cases or are unlikely to be manually produced.   To fill this gap, this paper proposes FuzzGPT, the first technique to prime LLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing. FuzzGPT is built on the well-known hypothesis that historical bug-triggering programs may include rare/valuable code ingredients important for bug finding. Traditional techniques leveraging such historical information require intensive human efforts to design dedicated generators and ensure the validity of generated programs. FuzzGPT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs (including fine-tuning and in-context learning), while being generalizable and applicable to challenging domains. While FuzzGPT can be applied with different LLMs, this paper focuses on the powerful GPT-style models: Codex and CodeGen. Moreover, FuzzGPT also shows the potential of directly leveraging the instruct-following capability of the recent ChatGPT for effective fuzzing. Evaluation on two popular DL libraries (PyTorch and TensorFlow) shows that FuzzGPT can substantially outperform TitanFuzz, detecting 76 bugs, with 49 already confirmed as previously unknown bugs, including 11 high-priority bugs or security vulnerabilities.

> Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the leading candidates for demonstrating the quantum advantage using near-term quantum computers. Unfortunately, high device error rates limit us from reliably running QAOA circuits for problems with more than a few qubits. In QAOA, the problem graph is translated into a quantum circuit such that every edge corresponds to two 2-qubit CNOT operations in each layer of the circuit. As CNOTs are extremely error-prone, the fidelity of QAOA circuits is dictated by the number of edges in the problem graph.   We observe that majority of graphs corresponding to real-world applications follow the ``power-law`` distribution, where some hotspot nodes have significantly higher number of connections. We leverage this insight and propose ``FrozenQubits`` that freezes the hotspot nodes or qubits and intelligently partitions the state-space of the given problem into several smaller sub-spaces which are then solved independently. The corresponding QAOA sub-circuits are significantly less vulnerable to gate and decoherence errors due to the reduced number of CNOT operations in each sub-circuit. Unlike prior circuit-cutting approaches, FrozenQubits does not require any exponentially complex post-processing step. Our evaluations with 5,300 QAOA circuits on eight different quantum computers from IBM shows that FrozenQubits can improve the quality of solutions by 8.73x on average (and by up to 57x), albeit utilizing 2x more quantum resources.

> Although cryptographic algorithms may be mathematically secure, it is often possible to leak secret information from the implementation of the algorithms. Timing and power side-channel vulnerabilities are some of the most widely considered threats to cryptographic algorithm implementations. Timing vulnerabilities may be easier to detect and exploit, and all high-quality cryptographic code today should be written in constant-time style. However, this does not prevent power side-channels from existing. With constant time code, potential attackers can resort to power side-channel attacks to try leaking secrets. Detecting potential power side-channel vulnerabilities is a tedious task, as it requires analyzing code at the assembly level and needs reasoning about which instructions could be leaking information based on their operands and their values. To help make the process of detecting potential power side-channel vulnerabilities easier for cryptographers, this work presents Pascal: Power Analysis Side Channel Attack Locator, a tool that introduces novel symbolic register analysis techniques for binary analysis of constant-time cryptographic algorithms, and verifies locations of potential power side-channel vulnerabilities with high precision. Pascal is evaluated on a number of implementations of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, and it is able to find dozens of previously reported single-trace power side-channel vulnerabilities in these algorithms, all in an automated manner.

> Fuzzing has become a commonly used approach to identifying bugs in complex, real-world programs. However, interpreters are notoriously difficult to fuzz effectively, as they expect highly structured inputs, which are rarely produced by most fuzzing mutations. For this class of programs, grammar-based fuzzing has been shown to be effective. Tools based on this approach can find bugs in the code that is executed after parsing the interpreter inputs, by following language-specific rules when generating and mutating test cases. Unfortunately, grammar-based fuzzing is often unable to discover subtle bugs associated with the parsing and handling of the language syntax. Additionally, if the grammar provided to the fuzzer is incomplete, or does not match the implementation completely, the fuzzer will fail to exercise important parts of the available functionality. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzing technique, called Token-Level Fuzzing. Instead of applying mutations either at the byte level or at the grammar level, Token-Level Fuzzing applies mutations at the token level. Evolutionary fuzzers can leverage this technique to both generate inputs that are parsed successfully and generate inputs that do not conform strictly to the grammar. As a result, the proposed approach can find bugs that neither byte-level fuzzing nor grammar-based fuzzing can find. We evaluated Token-Level Fuzzing by modifying AFL and fuzzing four popular JavaScript engines, finding 29 previously unknown bugs, several of which could not be found with state-of-the-art byte-level and grammar-based fuzzers.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being used to solve a wide range of problems in many domains including safety-critical domains like self-driving cars and medical imagery. DNNs suffer from vulnerability against adversarial attacks. In the past few years, numerous approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem by training networks using adversarial training. Almost all the approaches generate adversarial examples for the entire training dataset, thus increasing the training time drastically. We show that we can decrease the training time for any adversarial training algorithm by using only a subset of training data for adversarial training. To select the subset, we filter the adversarially-prone samples from the training data. We perform a simple adversarial attack on all training examples to filter this subset. In this attack, we add a small perturbation to each pixel and a few grid lines to the input image.   We perform adversarial training on the adversarially-prone subset and mix it with vanilla training performed on the entire dataset. Our results show that when our method-agnostic approach is plugged into FGSM, we achieve a speedup of 3.52x on MNIST and 1.98x on the CIFAR-10 dataset with comparable robust accuracy. We also test our approach on state-of-the-art Free adversarial training and achieve a speedup of 1.2x in training time with a marginal drop in robust accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.

> Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.

> Cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities continue to grow in number and complexity, presenting an increasing challenge for organizations worldwide. Organizations use threat modelling and bug bounty programs to address these threats, which often operate independently. In this paper, we propose a Metric-Based Feedback Methodology (MBFM) that integrates bug bounty programs with threat modelling to improve the overall security posture of an organization. By analyzing and categorizing vulnerability data, the methodology enables identifying root causes and refining threat models to prioritize security efforts more effectively. The paper outlines the proposed methodology and its assumptions and provides a foundation for future research to develop the methodology into a versatile framework. Further research should focus on automating the process, integrating additional security testing approaches, and leveraging machine learning algorithms for vulnerability prediction and team-specific recommendations.

> Automated program repair is the task of automatically repairing software bugs. A promising direction in this field is self-supervised learning, a learning paradigm in which repair models are trained without commits representing pairs of bug/fix. In self-supervised neural program repair, those bug/fix pairs are generated in some ways. The main problem is to generate interesting and diverse pairs that maximize the effectiveness of training. As a contribution to this problem, we propose to use back-translation, a technique coming from neural machine translation. We devise and implement MUFIN, a back-translation training technique for program repair, with specifically designed code critics to select high-quality training samples. Our results show that MUFIN's back-translation loop generates valuable training samples in a fully automated, self-supervised manner, generating more than half-a-million pairs of bug/fix. The code critic design is key because of a fundamental trade-off between how restrictive a critic is and how many samples are available for optimization during back-translation.

> Using APIs to develop software applications is the norm. APIs help developers to build applications faster as they do not need to reinvent the wheel. It is therefore important for developers to understand the APIs that they plan to use. Developers should also make themselves aware of relevant information updates about APIs. In order to do so, developers need to find and keep track of relevant information about the APIs that they are concerned with. Yet, the API information is scattered across various online sources, which makes it difficult to track by hand. Moreover, identifying content that is related to an API is not trivial. Motivated by these challenges, in this work, we introduce a tool named \tool that aims to ease the process of finding API information from various online sources. \tool is built on works that link APIs or libraries to various online sources. It supports finding API information on GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow's posts, tweets, YouTube videos, and common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) entries; and is extensible to support other sources.

> Image segmentation is an important problem in many safety-critical applications. Recent studies show that modern image segmentation models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, while existing attack methods mainly follow the idea of attacking image classification models. We argue that image segmentation and classification have inherent differences, and design an attack framework specially for image segmentation models. Our attack framework is inspired by certified radius, which was originally used by defenders to defend against adversarial perturbations to classification models. We are the first, from the attacker perspective, to leverage the properties of certified radius and propose a certified radius guided attack framework against image segmentation models. Specifically, we first adapt randomized smoothing, the state-of-the-art certification method for classification models, to derive the pixel's certified radius. We then focus more on disrupting pixels with relatively smaller certified radii and design a pixel-wise certified radius guided loss, when plugged into any existing white-box attack, yields our certified radius-guided white-box attack. Next, we propose the first black-box attack to image segmentation models via bandit. We design a novel gradient estimator, based on bandit feedback, which is query-efficient and provably unbiased and stable. We use this gradient estimator to design a projected bandit gradient descent (PBGD) attack, as well as a certified radius-guided PBGD (CR-PBGD) attack. We prove our PBGD and CR-PBGD attacks can achieve asymptotically optimal attack performance with an optimal rate. We evaluate our certified-radius guided white-box and black-box attacks on multiple modern image segmentation models and datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our certified radius-guided attack framework.

> Context: Software development is human-centric and vulnerable to human error. Human errors are errors in the human thought process. To ensure software quality, practitioners must understand how to manage these human errors. Organizations often change the requirements engineering process to prevent human errors from occurring or to mitigate the harm caused when those errors do occur. While there are studies on human error management in other disciplines, research on the prevention and mitigation of human errors in software engineering, and requirements engineering specifically, are limited. The software engineering studies do not provide strong results about the types of changes that are most effective in requirements engineering. Objective: The goal of this paper is to develop a taxonomy of human error prevention and mitigation strategies based on data from requirements engineering professionals. Method: We performed a qualitative analysis of two practitioner surveys on requirements engineering practices to identify and classify strategies for the prevention and mitigation of human errors. Results: We organized the human error management strategies into a taxonomy based on whether they primarily affect People, Processes, or the Environment. Inside each high-level category, we further organized the strategies into low-level classes. More than 50% of the reported strategies require a change in Process, 23% require a change in Environment, 21% require a change in People, with the remaining 5% too ambiguous to classify. In addition, more than 50\% of the strategies focus on Management activities. Conclusions: The Human Error Management Taxonomy provides a systematic classification and organization of strategies for prevention and mitigation of human errors in requirements engineering. This systematic organization provides a foundation upon which research can build.

> Automation of test oracles is one of the most challenging facets of software testing, but remains comparatively less addressed compared to automated test input generation. Test oracles rely on a ground-truth that can distinguish between the correct and buggy behavior to determine whether a test fails (detects a bug) or passes. What makes the oracle problem challenging and undecidable is the assumption that the ground-truth should know the exact expected, correct, or buggy behavior. However, we argue that one can still build an accurate oracle without knowing the exact correct or buggy behavior, but how these two might differ. This paper presents SEER, a learning-based approach that in the absence of test assertions or other types of oracle, can determine whether a unit test passes or fails on a given method under test (MUT). To build the ground-truth, SEER jointly embeds unit tests and the implementation of MUTs into a unified vector space, in such a way that the neural representation of tests are similar to that of MUTs they pass on them, but dissimilar to MUTs they fail on them. The classifier built on top of this vector representation serves as the oracle to generate "fail" labels, when test inputs detect a bug in MUT or "pass" labels, otherwise. Our extensive experiments on applying SEER to more than 5K unit tests from a diverse set of open-source Java projects show that the produced oracle is (1) effective in predicting the fail or pass labels, achieving an overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure of 93%, 86%, 94%, and 90%, (2) generalizable, predicting the labels for the unit test of projects that were not in training or validation set with negligible performance drop, and (3) efficient, detecting the existence of bugs in only 6.5 milliseconds on average.

> Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) is widely used in various binary analysis tasks such as vulnerability search, malware detection, clone detection, and patch analysis. Recent studies have shown that the learning-based binary code embedding models perform better than the traditional feature-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based binary code embedding model named UniASM to learn representations of the binary functions. We design two new training tasks to make the spatial distribution of the generated vectors more uniform, which can be used directly in BCSD without any fine-tuning. In addition, we present a new tokenization approach for binary functions, which increases the token's semantic information and mitigates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting model performance through ablation experiments and obtain some new and valuable findings. The experimental results show that UniASM outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach on the evaluation dataset. The average scores of Recall@1 on cross-compilers, cross-optimization levels, and cross-obfuscations are 0.77, 0.72, and 0.72. Besides, in the real-world task of known vulnerability search, UniASM outperforms all the current baselines.

> One of the new developments in chit-chat bots is a long-term memory mechanism that remembers information from past conversations for increasing engagement and consistency of responses. The bot is designed to extract knowledge of personal nature from their conversation partner, e.g., stating preference for a particular color. In this paper, we show that this memory mechanism can result in unintended behavior. In particular, we found that one can combine a personal statement with an informative statement that would lead the bot to remember the informative statement alongside personal knowledge in its long term memory. This means that the bot can be tricked into remembering misinformation which it would regurgitate as statements of fact when recalling information relevant to the topic of conversation. We demonstrate this vulnerability on the BlenderBot 2 framework implemented on the ParlAI platform and provide examples on the more recent and significantly larger BlenderBot 3 model. We generate 150 examples of misinformation, of which 114 (76%) were remembered by BlenderBot 2 when combined with a personal statement. We further assessed the risk of this misinformation being recalled after intervening innocuous conversation and in response to multiple questions relevant to the injected memory. Our evaluation was performed on both the memory-only and the combination of memory and internet search modes of BlenderBot 2. From the combinations of these variables, we generated 12,890 conversations and analyzed recalled misinformation in the responses. We found that when the chat bot is questioned on the misinformation topic, it was 328% more likely to respond with the misinformation as fact when the misinformation was in the long-term memory.

> Labeling issues with the skills required to complete them can help contributors to choose tasks in Open Source Software projects. However, manually labeling issues is time-consuming and error-prone, and current automated approaches are mostly limited to classifying issues as bugs/non-bugs. We investigate the feasibility and relevance of automatically labeling issues with what we call "API-domains," which are high-level categories of APIs. Therefore, we posit that the APIs used in the source code affected by an issue can be a proxy for the type of skills (e.g., DB, security, UI) needed to work on the issue. We ran a user study (n=74) to assess API-domain labels' relevancy to potential contributors, leveraged the issues' descriptions and the project history to build prediction models, and validated the predictions with contributors (n=20) of the projects. Our results show that (i) newcomers to the project consider API-domain labels useful in choosing tasks, (ii) labels can be predicted with a precision of 84% and a recall of 78.6% on average, (iii) the results of the predictions reached up to 71.3% in precision and 52.5% in recall when training with a project and testing in another (transfer learning), and (iv) project contributors consider most of the predictions helpful in identifying needed skills. These findings suggest our approach can be applied in practice to automatically label issues, assisting developers in finding tasks that better match their skills.

> This paper discusses the security posture of Android m-banking applications in Qatar. Since technology has developed over the years and more security methods are provided, banking is now heavily reliant on mobile applications for prompt service delivery to clients, thus enabling a seamless and remote transaction. However, such mobile banking applications have access to sensitive data for each bank customer which presents a potential attack vector for clients, and the banks. The banks, therefore, have the responsibility to protect the information of the client by providing a high-security layer to their mobile application. This research discusses m-banking applications for Android OS, its security, vulnerability, threats, and solutions. Two m-banking applications were analyzed and benchmarked against standardized best practices, using the combination of two mobile testing frameworks. The security weaknesses observed during the experimental evaluation suggest the need for a more robust security evaluation of a mobile banking application in the state of Qatar. Such an approach would further ensure the confidence of the end-users. Consequently, understanding the security posture would provide a veritable measure towards mbanking security and user awareness.

> In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of smart contract upgradability patterns using proxies. A primary characteristic of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain is that they are immutable once implemented, no changes can be made. Taking human error into account, as well as technology improvements and newly discovered vulnerabilities, there has been a need to upgrade these smart contracts, which may hold enormous amounts of Ether and hence become the target of attacks. Several such attacks have caused tremendous losses in the past, as well as millions of dollars in Ether which has been locked away in broken contracts. Thus far we have collected many upgradable proxy patterns and studied their features to build a comprehensive catalog of patterns. We present a summary of these upgradable proxy patterns which we collected and studied. We scraped the source code for approximately 100000 verified contracts from Etherscan.io, the most popular block explorer for Ethereum, out of which we extracted around 64k unique files - most containing multiple contracts. We have begun to automate the analysis of these contracts using the popular static analysis tool Slither, while at the same time implementing much more robust detection of upgradable proxies using this framework. Comparing the results of the original implementation to our own, we have found that approximately 70 percent of the contracts which were initially flagged as upgradeable proxies are false positives which we have eliminated.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Most $L_{0}$-norm based white-box attacks craft perturbations by the gradient of models to the input. Since the computation cost and memory limitation of calculating the Hessian matrix, the application of Hessian or approximate Hessian in white-box attacks is gradually shelved. In this work, we note that the sparsity requirement on perturbations naturally lends itself to the usage of Hessian information. We study the attack performance and computation cost of the attack method based on the Hessian with a limited number of perturbation pixels. Specifically, we propose the Limited Pixel BFGS (LP-BFGS) attack method by incorporating the perturbation pixel selection strategy and the BFGS algorithm. Pixels with top-k attribution scores calculated by the Integrated Gradient method are regarded as optimization variables of the LP-BFGS attack. Experimental results across different networks and datasets demonstrate that our approach has comparable attack ability with reasonable computation in different numbers of perturbation pixels compared with existing solutions.

> Novel technological achievements in the fields of business intelligence, business management and data science are based on real-time and complex virtual networks. Sharing data between a large number of organizations that leads to a system with high computational complexity is one of the considerable characteristics of the current business networks. Discovery, conformance and enhancement of the business processes are performed using the generated event logs. In this regard, one of the overlooked challenges is privacy-preserving in the field of process mining in the industry. To preserve the data-privacy with a low computational complexity structure that is a necessity for the current digital business technology, a novel lightweight encryption method based on Haar transform and a private key is proposed in this paper. We compare the proposed method with the well-known homomorphic cryptosystem and Walsh- Hadamard encryption (WHE) in terms of cryptography, computational complexity and structure vulnerability. The analyses show that the proposed method anonymizes the event logs with the lower complexity and more accuracy compared with two aforementioned cryptosystems, significantly.

> Smart contracts are nowadays at the core of most blockchain systems, as they specify and allow an agreement between entities that wish to perform a transaction. As any computer program, smart contracts are subject to the presence of residual faults, including severe security vulnerabilities, which require that the vulnerable contract is terminated in the blockchain. In this context, research began to be developed to prevent the deployment of smart contract holding vulnerabilities, mostly in the form of vulnerability detection tools. Along with these efforts, several and heterogeneous vulnerability classification schemes arised (e.g., most notably DASP and SWC). At the time of writing, these are mostly outdated initiatives, despite the fact that smart contract vulnerabilities are continuously being discovered and the associated rich information being mostly disregarded. In this paper, we propose OpenSCV, a new and Open hierarchical taxonomy for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, which is open to community contributions and matches the current state of the practice, while being prepared to handle future modifications and evolution. The taxonomy was built based on the analysis of research on vulnerability classification, community-maintained classification schemes, and research on smart contract vulnerability detection. We show how OpenSCV covers the announced detection ability of current vulnerability detection tools, and highlight its usefulness as a resource in smart contract vulnerability research.

> Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's Codex, have demonstrated their potential to generate code from natural language descriptions across a wide range of programming tasks. Several benchmarks have recently emerged to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate functionally correct code from natural language intent with respect to a set of hidden test cases. This has enabled the research community to identify significant and reproducible advancements in LLM capabilities. However, there is currently a lack of benchmark datasets for assessing the ability of LLMs to generate functionally correct code edits based on natural language descriptions of intended changes. This paper aims to address this gap by motivating the problem NL2Fix of translating natural language descriptions of code changes (namely bug fixes described in Issue reports in repositories) into correct code fixes. To this end, we introduce Defects4J-NL2Fix, a dataset of 283 Java programs from the popular Defects4J dataset augmented with high-level descriptions of bug fixes, and empirically evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs for the this task. Results show that these LLMS together are capable of generating plausible fixes for 64.6% of the bugs, and the best LLM-based technique can achieve up to 21.20% top-1 and 35.68% top-5 accuracy on this benchmark.

> Submodular optimization generalizes many classic problems in combinatorial optimization and has recently found a wide range of applications in machine learning (e.g., feature engineering and active learning). For many large-scale optimization problems, we are often concerned with the adaptivity complexity of an algorithm, which quantifies the number of sequential rounds where polynomially-many independent function evaluations can be executed in parallel. While low adaptivity is ideal, it is not sufficient for a distributed algorithm to be efficient, since in many practical applications of submodular optimization the number of function evaluations becomes prohibitively expensive. Motivated by these applications, we study the adaptivity and query complexity of adaptive submodular optimization.   Our main result is a distributed algorithm for maximizing a monotone submodular function with cardinality constraint $k$ that achieves a $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$-approximation in expectation. This algorithm runs in $O(\log(n))$ adaptive rounds and makes $O(n)$ calls to the function evaluation oracle in expectation. The approximation guarantee and query complexity are optimal, and the adaptivity is nearly optimal. Moreover, the number of queries is substantially less than in previous works. Last, we extend our results to the submodular cover problem to demonstrate the generality of our algorithm and techniques.

> Submodular maximization is a general optimization problem with a wide range of applications in machine learning (e.g., active learning, clustering, and feature selection). In large-scale optimization, the parallel running time of an algorithm is governed by its adaptivity, which measures the number of sequential rounds needed if the algorithm can execute polynomially-many independent oracle queries in parallel. While low adaptivity is ideal, it is not sufficient for an algorithm to be efficient in practice -- there are many applications of distributed submodular optimization where the number of function evaluations becomes prohibitively expensive. Motivated by these applications, we study the adaptivity and query complexity of submodular maximization. In this paper, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing a non-monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint $k$ that runs in $O(\log(n))$ adaptive rounds and makes $O(n \log(k))$ oracle queries in expectation. In our empirical study, we use three real-world applications to compare our algorithm with several benchmarks for non-monotone submodular maximization. The results demonstrate that our algorithm finds competitive solutions using significantly fewer rounds and queries.

> Machine learning models are vulnerable to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) examples, and such a problem has drawn much attention. However, current methods lack a full understanding of different types of OOD data: there are benign OOD data that can be properly adapted to enhance the learning performance, while other malign OOD data would severely degenerate the classification result. To Harness OOD data, this paper proposes a HOOD method that can leverage the content and style from each image instance to identify benign and malign OOD data. Particularly, we design a variational inference framework to causally disentangle content and style features by constructing a structural causal model. Subsequently, we augment the content and style through an intervention process to produce malign and benign OOD data, respectively. The benign OOD data contain novel styles but hold our interested contents, and they can be leveraged to help train a style-invariant model. In contrast, the malign OOD data inherit unknown contents but carry familiar styles, by detecting them can improve model robustness against deceiving anomalies. Thanks to the proposed novel disentanglement and data augmentation techniques, HOOD can effectively deal with OOD examples in unknown and open environments, whose effectiveness is empirically validated in three typical OOD applications including OOD detection, open-set semi-supervised learning, and open-set domain adaptation.

> Cyber attacks has always been of a great concern. Websites and services with poor security layers are the most vulnerable to such cyber attacks. The attackers can easily access sensitive data like credit card details and social security number from such vulnerable services. Currently to stop cyber attacks, various different methods are opted from using two-step verification methods like One-Time Password and push notification services to using high-end bio-metric devices like finger print reader and iris scanner are used as security layers. These current security measures carry a lot of cons and the worst is that user always need to carry the authentication device on them to access their data. To overcome this, we are proposing a technique of using keystroke dynamics (typing pattern) of a user to authenticate the genuine user. In the method, we are taking a data set of 51 users typing a password in 8 sessions done on alternate days to record mood fluctuations of the user. Developed and implemented anomaly-detection algorithm based on distance metrics and machine learning algorithms like Artificial Neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the users. In ANN, we implemented multi-class classification using 1-D convolution as the data was correlated and multi-class classification with negative class which was used to classify anomaly based on all users put together. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 95.05% using ANN with Negative Class. From the results achieved, we can say that the model works perfectly and can be bought into the market as a security layer and a good alternative to two-step verification using external devices. This technique will enable users to have two-step security layer without worrying about carry an authentication device.

> Quantization has emerged as an essential technique for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on devices with limited resources. However, quantized models exhibit vulnerabilities when exposed to various noises in real-world applications. Despite the importance of evaluating the impact of quantization on robustness, existing research on this topic is limited and often disregards established principles of robustness evaluation, resulting in incomplete and inconclusive findings. To address this gap, we thoroughly evaluated the robustness of quantized models against various noises (adversarial attacks, natural corruptions, and systematic noises) on ImageNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that lower-bit quantization is more resilient to adversarial attacks but is more susceptible to natural corruptions and systematic noises. Notably, our investigation reveals that impulse noise (in natural corruptions) and the nearest neighbor interpolation (in systematic noises) have the most significant impact on quantized models. Our research contributes to advancing the robust quantization of models and their deployment in real-world scenarios.

> We study vulnerability of a uniformly distributed random graph to an attack by an adversary who aims for a global change of the distribution while being able to make only a local change in the graph. We call a graph property $A$ anti-stochastic if the probability that a random graph $G$ satisfies $A$ is small but, with high probability, there is a small perturbation transforming $G$ into a graph satisfying $A$. While for labeled graphs such properties are easy to obtain from binary covering codes, the existence of anti-stochastic properties for unlabeled graphs is not so evident. If an admissible perturbation is either the addition or the deletion of one edge, we exhibit an anti-stochastic property that is satisfied by a random unlabeled graph of order $n$ with probability $(2+o(1))/n^2$, which is as small as possible. We also express another anti-stochastic property in terms of the degree sequence of a graph. This property has probability $(2+o(1))/(n\ln n)$, which is optimal up to factor of 2.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) obtain tremendous success in modeling relational data. Still, they are prone to adversarial attacks, which are massive threats to applying GNNs to risk-sensitive domains. Existing defensive methods neither guarantee performance facing new data/tasks or adversarial attacks nor provide insights to understand GNN robustness from an architectural perspective. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has the potential to solve this problem by automating GNN architecture designs. Nevertheless, current graph NAS approaches lack robust design and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Robust Neural Architecture search framework for GNNs (G-RNA). Specifically, we design a robust search space for the message-passing mechanism by adding graph structure mask operations into the search space, which comprises various defensive operation candidates and allows us to search for defensive GNNs. Furthermore, we define a robustness metric to guide the search procedure, which helps to filter robust architectures. In this way, G-RNA helps understand GNN robustness from an architectural perspective and effectively searches for optimal adversarial robust GNNs. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets show that G-RNA significantly outperforms manually designed robust GNNs and vanilla graph NAS baselines by 12.1% to 23.4% under adversarial attacks.

> Java deserialization vulnerability is a severe threat in practice. Researchers have proposed static analysis solutions to locate candidate vulnerabilities and fuzzing solutions to generate proof-of-concept (PoC) serialized objects to trigger them. However, existing solutions have limited effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid solution ODDFUZZ to efficiently discover Java deserialization vulnerabilities. First, ODDFUZZ performs lightweight static taint analysis to identify candidate gadget chains that may cause deserialization vulner-abilities. In this step, ODDFUZZ tries to locate all candidates and avoid false negatives. Then, ODDFUZZ performs directed greybox fuzzing (DGF) to explore those candidates and generate PoC testcases to mitigate false positives. Specifically, ODDFUZZ applies a structure-aware seed generation method to guarantee the validity of the testcases, and adopts a novel hybrid feedback and a step-forward strategy to guide the directed fuzzing. We implemented a prototype of ODDFUZZ and evaluated it on the popular Java deserialization repository ysoserial. Results show that, ODDFUZZ could discover 16 out of 34 known gadget chains, while two state-of-the-art baselines only identify three of them. In addition, we evaluated ODDFUZZ on real-world applications including Oracle WebLogic Server, Apache Dubbo, Sonatype Nexus, and protostuff, and found six previously unreported exploitable gadget chains with five CVEs assigned.

> Static analysis is the process of analyzing software code without executing the software. It can help find bugs and potential problems in software that may only appear at runtime. Although many static analysis tools have been developed for classical software, due to the nature of quantum programs, these existing tools are unsuitable for analyzing quantum programs. This paper presents QChecker, a static analysis tool that supports finding bugs in quantum programs in Qiskit. QChecker consists of two main modules: a module for extracting program information based on abstract syntax tree (AST), and a module for detecting bugs based on patterns. We evaluate the performance of QChecker using the Bugs4Q benchmark. The evaluation results show that QChecker can effectively detect various bugs in quantum programs.

> Blockchain-based Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is widely considered as secure communication architecture for a connected transportation system. With the advent of quantum computing, there are concerns regarding the vulnerability of this architecture against cyber-attacks. In this study, a potential threat is investigated in a blockchain-based VANET, and a corresponding quantum cyber-attack is developed. Specifically, a quantum impersonation attack using Quantum-Shor algorithm is developed to break the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encrypted digital signatures of VANET and thus create a threat for the trust-based blockchain scheme of VANET. A blockchain-based VANET, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and vehicular mobility are simulated using OMNET++, the extended INET library, and vehicles-in-network simulation (VEINS) along with simulation of urban mobility (SUMO), respectively. A small key RSA based message encryption is implemented using IBM Qiskit, which is an open-source quantum software development kit. The findings reveal that the quantum cyber-attack, example, impersonation attack is able to successfully break the trust chain of a blockchain-based VANET. This highlights the need for a quantum secured blockchain.

> Neural Architectures Search (NAS) becomes more and more popular over these years. However, NAS-generated models tends to suffer greater vulnerability to various malicious attacks. Lots of robust NAS methods leverage adversarial training to enhance the robustness of NAS-generated models, however, they neglected the nature accuracy of NAS-generated models. In our paper, we propose a novel NAS method, Robust Neural Architecture Search (RNAS). To design a regularization term to balance accuracy and robustness, RNAS generates architectures with both high accuracy and good robustness. To reduce search cost, we further propose to use noise examples instead adversarial examples as input to search architectures. Extensive experiments show that RNAS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both image classification and adversarial attacks, which illustrates the proposed RNAS achieves a good tradeoff between robustness and accuracy.

> Most currently used cryptographic tools for protecting data are based on certain computational assumptions, which makes them vulnerable with respect to technological and algorithmic developments, such as quantum computing. One existing option to counter this potential threat is quantum key distribution, whose security is based on the laws of quantum physics. Quantum key distribution is secure against unforeseen technological developments. A second approach is post-quantum cryptography, which is a set of cryptographic primitives that are believed to be secure even against attacks with both classical and quantum computing technologies. From this perspective, this study reviews recent progress in the deployment of the quantum-secured infrastructure based on quantum key distribution, post-quantum cryptography, and their combinations. Various directions in the further development of the full-stack quantum-secured infrastructure are also indicated. Distributed applications, such as blockchains and distributed ledgers, are also discussed.

> Graph self-supervised learning (SSL), including contrastive and generative approaches, offers great potential to address the fundamental challenge of label scarcity in real-world graph data. Among both sets of graph SSL techniques, the masked graph autoencoders (e.g., GraphMAE)--one type of generative method--have recently produced promising results. The idea behind this is to reconstruct the node features (or structures)--that are randomly masked from the input--with the autoencoder architecture. However, the performance of masked feature reconstruction naturally relies on the discriminability of the input features and is usually vulnerable to disturbance in the features. In this paper, we present a masked self-supervised learning framework GraphMAE2 with the goal of overcoming this issue. The idea is to impose regularization on feature reconstruction for graph SSL. Specifically, we design the strategies of multi-view random re-mask decoding and latent representation prediction to regularize the feature reconstruction. The multi-view random re-mask decoding is to introduce randomness into reconstruction in the feature space, while the latent representation prediction is to enforce the reconstruction in the embedding space. Extensive experiments show that GraphMAE2 can consistently generate top results on various public datasets, including at least 2.45% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on ogbn-Papers100M with 111M nodes and 1.6B edges.

> Past work exploring adversarial vulnerability have focused on situations where an adversary can perturb all dimensions of model input. On the other hand, a range of recent works consider the case where either (i) an adversary can perturb a limited number of input parameters or (ii) a subset of modalities in a multimodal problem. In both of these cases, adversarial examples are effectively constrained to a subspace $V$ in the ambient input space $\mathcal{X}$. Motivated by this, in this work we investigate how adversarial vulnerability depends on $\dim(V)$. In particular, we show that the adversarial success of standard PGD attacks with $\ell^p$ norm constraints behaves like a monotonically increasing function of $\epsilon (\frac{\dim(V)}{\dim \mathcal{X}})^{\frac{1}{q}}$ where $\epsilon$ is the perturbation budget and $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} =1$, provided $p > 1$ (the case $p=1$ presents additional subtleties which we analyze in some detail). This functional form can be easily derived from a simple toy linear model, and as such our results land further credence to arguments that adversarial examples are endemic to locally linear models on high dimensional spaces.

Method: We consider the bugs, the type of work when the bug was introduced, aspects of the build process, code review, software tests, and any other discussion related to the bug that we can identify. We use a qualitative approach that first describes variables of the development process and then groups the variables based on their relations. From these groups, we can induce how their (pair-wise) interactions affect bug-introducing changes.

> O-RAN establishes an advanced radio access network (RAN) architecture that supports inter-operable, multi-vendor, and artificial intelligence (AI) controlled wireless access networks. The unique components, interfaces, and technologies of O-RAN differentiate it from the 3GPP RAN. Because O-RAN supports 3GPP protocols, currently 4G and 5G, while offering additional network interfaces and controllers, it has a larger attack surface. The O-RAN security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats, and countermeasures must be carefully assessed for it to become a platform for 5G Advanced and future 6G wireless. This article presents the ongoing standardization activities of the O-RAN Alliance for modeling the potential threats to the network and to the open fronthaul interface, in particular. We identify end-to-end security threats and discuss those on the open fronthaul in more detail.

> Blockchain recently became very popular due to its use in cryptocurrencies and potential application in various domains (e.g., retail, healthcare, insurance). The smart contract is a key part of blockchain systems and specifies an agreement between transaction participants. Nowadays, smart contracts are being deployed carrying residual faults, including severe vulnerabilities that lead to different types of failures at runtime. Fault detection tools can be used to detect faults that may then be removed from the code before deployment. However, in the case of smart contracts, the common opinion is that tools are immature and ineffective. In this work, we carry out a fault injection campaign to empirically analyze the runtime impact that realistic faults present in smart contracts may have on the reliability of blockchain systems. We place particular attention on the faults that elude popular smart contract verification tools and show if and in which ways the faults lead the blockchain system to fail at runtime. Results show general poor detection and, to some extent, complementary performance by the three tools used. The results also show that several elusive faults are responsible for severe blockchain failures.

> Novel non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies offer high-speed and high-density data storage. In addition, they overcome the von Neumann bottleneck by enabling computing-in-memory (CIM). Various computer architectures have been proposed to integrate CIM blocks in their design, forming a mixed-signal system to combine the computational benefits of CIM with the robustness of conventional CMOS. Novel electronic design automation (EDA) tools are necessary to design and manufacture these so-called neuromorphic systems. Furthermore, EDA tools must consider the impact of security vulnerabilities, as hardware security attacks have increased in recent years. Existing information flow analysis (IFA) frameworks offer an automated tool-suite to uphold the confidentiality property for sensitive data during the design of hardware. However, currently available mixed-signal EDA tools are not capable of analyzing the information flow of neuromorphic systems. To illustrate the shortcomings, we develop information flow protocols for NVMs that can be easily integrated in the already existing tool-suites. We show the limitation of the state-of-the-art by analyzing the flow from sensitive signals through multiple memristive crossbar structures to potential untrusted components and outputs. Finally, we provide a thorough discussion of the merits and flaws of the mixed-signal IFA frameworks on neuromorphic systems.

> Great advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which have brought great concerns when deploying these models to safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Different defense approaches have been proposed against adversarial attacks, including: a) empirical defenses, which can usually be adaptively attacked again without providing robustness certification; and b) certifiably robust approaches, which consist of robustness verification providing the lower bound of robust accuracy against any attacks under certain conditions and corresponding robust training approaches. In this paper, we systematize certifiably robust approaches and related practical and theoretical implications and findings. We also provide the first comprehensive benchmark on existing robustness verification and training approaches on different datasets. In particular, we 1) provide a taxonomy for the robustness verification and training approaches, as well as summarize the methodologies for representative algorithms, 2) reveal the characteristics, strengths, limitations, and fundamental connections among these approaches, 3) discuss current research progresses, theoretical barriers, main challenges, and future directions for certifiably robust approaches for DNNs, and 4) provide an open-sourced unified platform to evaluate 20+ representative certifiably robust approaches.

> As data becomes increasingly vital, a company would be very cautious about releasing data, because the competitors could use it to train high-performance models, thereby posing a tremendous threat to the company's commercial competence. To prevent training good models on the data, we could add imperceptible perturbations to it. Since such perturbations aim at hurting the entire training process, they should reflect the vulnerability of DNN training, rather than that of a single model. Based on this new idea, we seek perturbed examples that are always unrecognized (never correctly classified) in training. In this paper, we uncover them by model checkpoints' gradients, forming the proposed self-ensemble protection (SEP), which is very effective because (1) learning on examples ignored during normal training tends to yield DNNs ignoring normal examples; (2) checkpoints' cross-model gradients are close to orthogonal, meaning that they are as diverse as DNNs with different architectures. That is, our amazing performance of ensemble only requires the computation of training one model. By extensive experiments with 9 baselines on 3 datasets and 5 architectures, SEP is verified to be a new state-of-the-art, e.g., our small $\ell_\infty=2/255$ perturbations reduce the accuracy of a CIFAR-10 ResNet18 from 94.56% to 14.68%, compared to 41.35% by the best-known method.

> The importance of cloud computing has grown over the last years, which resulted in a significant increase of Data Center (DC) network requirements. Virtualisation is one of the key drivers of that transformation and enables a massive deployment of computing resources, which exhausts server capacity limits. Furthermore, the increased network endpoints need to be handled dynamically and centrally to facilitate cloud computing functionalities. Traditional DCs barely satisfy those demands because of their inherent limitations based on the network topology. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) promise to meet the increasing network requirements for cloud applications by decoupling control functionalities from data forwarding. Although SDN solutions add more flexibility to DC networks, they also pose new vulnerabilities with a high impact due to the centralised architecture. In this paper we propose an evaluation framework for assessing the security level of SDN architectures in four different stages. Furthermore, we show in an experimental study, how the framework can be used for mapping SDN threats with associated vulnerabilities and necessary mitigations in conjunction with risk and impact classification. The proposed framework helps administrators to evaluate the network security level, to apply countermeasures for identified SDN threats, and to meet the networks security requirements.

> Federated learning (FL) is a framework for users to jointly train a machine learning model. FL is promoted as a privacy-enhancing technology (PET) that provides data minimization: data never "leaves" personal devices and users share only model updates with a server (e.g., a company) coordinating the distributed training. While prior work showed that in vanilla FL a malicious server can extract users' private data from the model updates, in this work we take it further and demonstrate that a malicious server can reconstruct user data even in hardened versions of the protocol. More precisely, we propose an attack against FL protected with distributed differential privacy (DDP) and secure aggregation (SA). Our attack method is based on the introduction of sybil devices that deviate from the protocol to expose individual users' data for reconstruction by the server. The underlying root cause for the vulnerability to our attack is a power imbalance: the server orchestrates the whole protocol and users are given little guarantees about the selection of other users participating in the protocol. Moving forward, we discuss requirements for privacy guarantees in FL. We conclude that users should only participate in the protocol when they trust the server or they apply local primitives such as local DP, shifting power away from the server. Yet, the latter approaches come at significant overhead in terms of performance degradation of the trained model, making them less likely to be deployed in practice.

> Smart contracts are increasingly being used to manage large numbers of high-value cryptocurrency accounts. There is a strong demand for automated, efficient, and comprehensive methods to detect security vulnerabilities in a given contract. While the literature features a plethora of analysis methods for smart contracts, the existing proposals do not address the increasing complexity of contracts. Existing analysis tools suffer from false alarms and missed bugs in today's smart contracts that are increasingly defined by complexity and interdependencies. To scale accurate analysis to modern smart contracts, we introduce EF/CF, a high-performance fuzzer for Ethereum smart contracts. In contrast to previous work, EF/CF efficiently and accurately models complex smart contract interactions, such as reentrancy and cross-contract interactions, at a very high fuzzing throughput rate. To achieve this, EF/CF transpiles smart contract bytecode into native C++ code, thereby enabling the reuse of existing, optimized fuzzing toolchains. Furthermore, EF/CF increases fuzzing efficiency by employing a structure-aware mutation engine for smart contract transaction sequences and using a contract's ABI to generate valid transaction inputs. In a comprehensive evaluation, we show that EF/CF scales better -- without compromising accuracy -- to complex contracts compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including other fuzzers, symbolic/concolic execution, and hybrid approaches. Moreover, we show that EF/CF can automatically generate transaction sequences that exploit reentrancy bugs to steal Ether.

> Context: Smart contracts are computerized self-executing contracts that contain clauses, which are enforced once certain conditions are met. Smart contracts are immutable by design and cannot be modified once deployed, which ensures trustlessness. Despite smart contracts' immutability benefits, upgrading contract code is still necessary for bug fixes and potential feature improvements. In the past few years, the smart contract community introduced several practices for upgrading smart contracts. Upgradeable contracts are smart contracts that exhibit these practices and are designed with upgradeability in mind. During the upgrade process, a new smart contract version is deployed with the desired modification, and subsequent user requests will be forwarded to the latest version (upgraded contract). Nevertheless, little is known about the characteristics of the upgrading practices, how developers apply them, and how upgrading impacts contract usage.   Objectives: This paper aims to characterize smart contract upgrading patterns and analyze their prevalence based on the deployed contracts that exhibit these patterns. Furthermore, we intend to investigate the reasons why developers upgrade contracts (e.g., introduce features, fix vulnerabilities) and how upgrades affect the adoption and life span of a contract in practice.   Method: We collect deployed smart contracts metadata and source codes to identify contracts that exhibit certain upgrade patterns (upgradeable contracts) based on a set of policies. Then we trace smart contract versions for each upgradable contract and identify the changes in contract versions using similarity and vulnerabilities detection tools. Finally, we plan to analyze the impact of upgrading on contract usage based on the number of transactions received and the lifetime of the contract version.

> Adversarial examples have been found for various deep as well as shallow learning models, and have at various times been suggested to be either fixable model-specific bugs, or else inherent dataset feature, or both. We present theoretical and empirical results to show that adversarial examples are approximate discontinuities resulting from models that specify approximately bijective maps $f: \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R^m; n \neq m$ over their inputs, and this discontinuity follows from the topological invariance of dimension.

> Few-shot learning (FSL) techniques seek to learn the underlying patterns in data using fewer samples, analogous to how humans learn from limited experience. In this limited-data scenario, the challenges associated with deep neural networks, such as shortcut learning and texture bias behaviors, are further exacerbated. Moreover, the significance of addressing shortcut learning is not yet fully explored in the few-shot setup. To address these issues, we propose LSFSL, which enforces the model to learn more generalizable features utilizing the implicit prior information present in the data. Through comprehensive analyses, we demonstrate that LSFSL-trained models are less vulnerable to alteration in color schemes, statistical correlations, and adversarial perturbations leveraging the global semantics in the data. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating relevant priors in few-shot approaches to increase robustness and generalization.

> In recent years, a proliferation of cyber-security threats and diversity has been on the rise culminating in an increase in their reporting and analysis. To counter that, many non-profit organizations have emerged in this domain, such as MITRE and OSWAP, which have been actively tracking vulnerabilities, and publishing defense recommendations in standardized formats. As producing data in such formats manually is very time-consuming, there have been some proposals to automate the process. Unfortunately, a major obstacle to adopting supervised machine learning for this problem has been the lack of publicly available specialized datasets. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we focus on mapping CVE records into MITRE CWE Weaknesses, and we release to the research community a manually annotated dataset of 4,012 records for this task. With a human-in-the-loop framework in mind, we approach the problem as a ranking task and aim to incorporate reinforced learning to make use of the human feedback in future work. Our experimental results using fine-tuned deep learning models, namely Sentence-BERT and rankT5, show sizable performance gains over BM25, BERT, and RoBERTa, which demonstrates the need for an architecture capable of good semantic understanding for this task.

> State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial manipulation and backdoor attacks. Backdoored models deviate from expected behavior on inputs with predefined triggers while retaining performance on clean data. Recent works focus on software simulation of backdoor injection during the inference phase by modifying network weights, which we find often unrealistic in practice due to restrictions in hardware.   In contrast, in this work for the first time, we present an end-to-end backdoor injection attack realized on actual hardware on a classifier model using Rowhammer as the fault injection method. To this end, we first investigate the viability of backdoor injection attacks in real-life deployments of DNNs on hardware and address such practical issues in hardware implementation from a novel optimization perspective. We are motivated by the fact that vulnerable memory locations are very rare, device-specific, and sparsely distributed. Consequently, we propose a novel network training algorithm based on constrained optimization to achieve a realistic backdoor injection attack in hardware. By modifying parameters uniformly across the convolutional and fully-connected layers as well as optimizing the trigger pattern together, we achieve state-of-the-art attack performance with fewer bit flips. For instance, our method on a hardware-deployed ResNet-20 model trained on CIFAR-10 achieves over 89% test accuracy and 92% attack success rate by flipping only 10 out of 2.2 million bits.

> Is overparameterization a privacy liability? In this work, we study the effect that the number of parameters has on a classifier's vulnerability to membership inference attacks. We first demonstrate how the number of parameters of a model can induce a privacy--utility trade-off: increasing the number of parameters generally improves generalization performance at the expense of lower privacy. However, remarkably, we then show that if coupled with proper regularization, increasing the number of parameters of a model can actually simultaneously increase both its privacy and performance, thereby eliminating the privacy--utility trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate this curious phenomenon for logistic regression with ridge regularization in a bi-level feature ensemble setting. Pursuant to our theoretical exploration, we develop a novel leave-one-out analysis tool to precisely characterize the vulnerability of a linear classifier to the optimal membership inference attack. We empirically exhibit this "blessing of dimensionality" for neural networks on a variety of tasks using early stopping as the regularizer.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Moreover, the transferability of the adversarial examples has received broad attention in recent years, which means that adversarial examples crafted by a surrogate model can also attack unknown models. This phenomenon gave birth to the transfer-based adversarial attacks, which aim to improve the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose to improve the transferability of adversarial examples in the transfer-based attack via masking unimportant parameters (MUP). The key idea in MUP is to refine the pretrained surrogate models to boost the transfer-based attack. Based on this idea, a Taylor expansion-based metric is used to evaluate the parameter importance score and the unimportant parameters are masked during the generation of adversarial examples. This process is simple, yet can be naturally combined with various existing gradient-based optimizers for generating adversarial examples, thus further improving the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MUP-based methods.

> While having achieved great success in rich real-life applications, deep neural network (DNN) models have long been criticized for their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Tremendous research efforts have been dedicated to mitigating the threats of adversarial attacks, but the essential trait of adversarial examples is not yet clear, and most existing methods are yet vulnerable to hybrid attacks and suffer from counterattacks. In light of this, in this paper, we first reveal a gradient-based correlation between sensitivity analysis-based DNN interpreters and the generation process of adversarial examples, which indicates the Achilles's heel of adversarial attacks and sheds light on linking together the two long-standing challenges of DNN: fragility and unexplainability. We then propose an interpreter-based ensemble framework called X-Ensemble for robust adversary defense. X-Ensemble adopts a novel detection-rectification process and features in building multiple sub-detectors and a rectifier upon various types of interpretation information toward target classifiers. Moreover, X-Ensemble employs the Random Forests (RF) model to combine sub-detectors into an ensemble detector for adversarial hybrid attacks defense. The non-differentiable property of RF further makes it a precious choice against the counterattack of adversaries. Extensive experiments under various types of state-of-the-art attacks and diverse attack scenarios demonstrate the advantages of X-Ensemble to competitive baseline methods.

> Behavioral data generated by users' devices, ranging from emoji use to pages visited, are collected at scale to improve apps and services. These data, however, contain fine-grained records and can reveal sensitive information about individual users. Local differential privacy has been used by companies as a solution to collect data from users while preserving privacy. We here first introduce pool inference attacks, where an adversary has access to a user's obfuscated data, defines pools of objects, and exploits the user's polarized behavior in multiple data collections to infer the user's preferred pool. Second, we instantiate this attack against Count Mean Sketch, a local differential privacy mechanism proposed by Apple and deployed in iOS and Mac OS devices, using a Bayesian model. Using Apple's parameters for the privacy loss $\varepsilon$, we then consider two specific attacks: one in the emojis setting -- where an adversary aims at inferring a user's preferred skin tone for emojis -- and one against visited websites -- where an adversary wants to learn the political orientation of a user from the news websites they visit. In both cases, we show the attack to be much more effective than a random guess when the adversary collects enough data. We find that users with high polarization and relevant interest are significantly more vulnerable, and we show that our attack is well-calibrated, allowing the adversary to target such vulnerable users. We finally validate our results for the emojis setting using user data from Twitter. Taken together, our results show that pool inference attacks are a concern for data protected by local differential privacy mechanisms with a large $\varepsilon$, emphasizing the need for additional technical safeguards and the need for more research on how to apply local differential privacy for multiple collections.

> Smart grid advancements and the increased integration of digital devices have transformed the existing power grid into a cyber-physical energy system. This reshaping of the current power system can make it vulnerable to cyberattacks, which could cause irreversible damage to the energy infrastructure resulting in the loss of power, equipment damage, etc. Constant threats emphasize the importance of cybersecurity investigations. At the same time, developing cyber-physical system (CPS) simulation testbeds is crucial for vulnerability assessment and the implementation and validation of security solutions. In this paper, two separate real-time CPS testbeds are developed based on the availability of local research facilities for impact analysis of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on microgrids. The two configurations are implemented using two different digital real-time simulator systems, one using the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) with a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup and the other one using OPAL-RT with ExataCPS to emulate the cyber-layer infrastructure. Both testbeds demonstrate the impact of DoS attacks on microgrid control and protection operation.

> Compute In-Memory platforms such as memristive crossbars are gaining focus as they facilitate acceleration of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with high area and compute-efficiencies. However, the intrinsic non-idealities associated with the analog nature of computing in crossbars limits the performance of the deployed DNNs. Furthermore, DNNs are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks leading to severe security threats in their large-scale deployment. Thus, finding adversarially robust DNN architectures for non-ideal crossbars is critical to the safe and secure deployment of DNNs on the edge. This work proposes a two-phase algorithm-hardware co-optimization approach called XploreNAS that searches for hardware-efficient & adversarially robust neural architectures for non-ideal crossbar platforms. We use the one-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach to train a large Supernet with crossbar-awareness and sample adversarially robust Subnets therefrom, maintaining competitive hardware-efficiency. Our experiments on crossbars with benchmark datasets (SVHN, CIFAR10 & CIFAR100) show upto ~8-16% improvement in the adversarial robustness of the searched Subnets against a baseline ResNet-18 model subjected to crossbar-aware adversarial training. We benchmark our robust Subnets for Energy-Delay-Area-Products (EDAPs) using the Neurosim tool and find that with additional hardware-efficiency driven optimizations, the Subnets attain ~1.5-1.6x lower EDAPs than ResNet-18 baseline.

> The robustness of a deep classifier can be characterized by its margins: the decision boundary's distances to natural data points. However, it is unclear whether existing robust training methods effectively increase the margin for each vulnerable point during training. To understand this, we propose a continuous-time framework for quantifying the relative speed of the decision boundary with respect to each individual point. Through visualizing the moving speed of the decision boundary under Adversarial Training, one of the most effective robust training algorithms, a surprising moving-behavior is revealed: the decision boundary moves away from some vulnerable points but simultaneously moves closer to others, decreasing their margins. To alleviate these conflicting dynamics of the decision boundary, we propose Dynamics-aware Robust Training (DyART), which encourages the decision boundary to engage in movement that prioritizes increasing smaller margins. In contrast to prior works, DyART directly operates on the margins rather than their indirect approximations, allowing for more targeted and effective robustness improvement. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets verify that DyART alleviates the conflicting dynamics of the decision boundary and obtains improved robustness under various perturbation sizes compared to the state-of-the-art defenses.

> Transient Execution Attacks (TEAs) have gradually become a major security threat to modern high-performance processors. They exploit the vulnerability of speculative execution to illegally access private data, and transmit them through timing-based covert channels. While new vulnerabilities are discovered continuously, the covert channels can be categorised to two types: 1) Persistent Type, in which covert channels are based on the layout changes of buffering, e.g. through caches or TLBs; 2) Volatile Type, in which covert channels are based on the contention of sharing resources, e.g. through execution units or issuing ports. The defenses against the persistent-type covert channels have been well addressed, while those for the volatile-type are still rather inadequate. Existing mitigation schemes for the volatile type such as Speculative Compression and Time-Division-Multiplexing will introduce significant overhead due to the need to stall the pipeline or to disallow resource sharing. In this paper, we look into such attacks and defenses with a new perspective, and propose a scheduling-based mitigation scheme, called SPECWANDS. It consists of three priority-based scheduling policies to prevent an attacker from transmitting the secret in different contention situations. SPECWANDS not only can defend against both inter-thread and intra-thread based attacks, but also can keep most of the performance benefit from speculative execution and resource-sharing. We evaluate its runtime overhead on SPEC 2017 benchmarks and realistic programs. The experimental results show that SPECWANDS has a significant performance advantage over the other two representative schemes.

> Speech-centric machine learning systems have revolutionized many leading domains ranging from transportation and healthcare to education and defense, profoundly changing how people live, work, and interact with each other. However, recent studies have demonstrated that many speech-centric ML systems may need to be considered more trustworthy for broader deployment. Specifically, concerns over privacy breaches, discriminating performance, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks have all been discovered in ML research fields. In order to address the above challenges and risks, a significant number of efforts have been made to ensure these ML systems are trustworthy, especially private, safe, and fair. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on speech-centric trustworthy ML topics related to privacy, safety, and fairness. In addition to serving as a summary report for the research community, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to explore further in this area.

> Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is a recent machine learning paradigm which is immensely useful in various real-life applications, like image analysis, video anomaly detection, text classification, etc. It is well known that most of the existing machine learning classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Since MIL is a weakly supervised learning, where information is available for a set of instances, called bag and not for every instances, adversarial perturbations can be fatal. In this paper, we have proposed two adversarial perturbation methods to analyze the effect of adversarial perturbations to interpret the vulnerability of MIL methods. Out of the two algorithms, one can be customized for every bag, and the other is a universal one, which can affect all bags in a given data set and thus has some generalizability. Through simulations, we have also shown the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms to fool the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods. Finally, we have discussed through experiments, about taking care of these kind of adversarial perturbations through a simple strategy.

> Automated Program Repair (APR) improves software reliability by generating patches for a buggy program automatically. Recent APR techniques leverage deep learning (DL) to build models to learn to generate patches from existing patches and code corpora. While promising, DL-based APR techniques suffer from the abundant syntactically or semantically incorrect patches in the patch space. These patches often disobey the syntactic and semantic domain knowledge of source code and thus cannot be the correct patches to fix a bug.   We propose a DL-based APR approach KNOD, which incorporates domain knowledge to guide patch generation in a direct and comprehensive way. KNOD has two major novelties, including (1) a novel three-stage tree decoder, which directly generates Abstract Syntax Trees of patched code according to the inherent tree structure, and (2) a novel domain-rule distillation, which leverages syntactic and semantic rules and teacher-student distributions to explicitly inject the domain knowledge into the decoding procedure during both the training and inference phases.   We evaluate KNOD on three widely-used benchmarks. KNOD fixes 72 bugs on the Defects4J v1.2, 25 bugs on the QuixBugs, and 50 bugs on the additional Defects4J v2.0 benchmarks, outperforming all existing APR tools.

> Automated program repair (APR) aims to help developers improve software reliability by generating patches for buggy programs. Although many code language models (CLM) are developed and effective in many software tasks such as code completion, there has been little comprehensive, in-depth work to evaluate CLMs' fixing capabilities and to fine-tune CLMs for the APR task.   Firstly, this work is the first to evaluate ten CLMs on four APR benchmarks, which shows that surprisingly, the best CLM, as is, fixes 72% more bugs than the state-of-the-art deep-learning (DL)-based APR techniques. Secondly, one of the four APR benchmarks was created by us in this paper to avoid data leaking for a fair evaluation. Thirdly, it is the first work to fine-tune CLMs with APR training data, which shows that fine-tuning brings 31%-1,267% improvement to CLMs and enables them to fix 46%-164% more bugs than existing DL-based APR techniques. Fourthly, this work studies the impact of buggy lines, showing that CLMs, as is, cannot make good use of the buggy lines to fix bugs, yet fine-tuned CLMs could potentially over-rely on buggy lines. Lastly, this work analyzes the size, time, and memory efficiency of different CLMs.   This work shows promising directions for the APR domain, such as fine-tuning CLMs with APR-specific designs, and also raises awareness of fair and comprehensive evaluations of CLMs and calls for more transparent reporting of open-source repositories used in the pre-training data to address the data leaking problem.

> Modern x86 processors support an AVX instruction set to boost performance. However, this extension may cause security issues. We discovered that there are vulnerable properties in implementing masked load/store instructions. Based on this, we present a novel AVX timing side-channel attack that can defeat address space layout randomization. We demonstrate the significance of our attack by showing User and Kernel ASLR breaks on the recent Intel and AMD processors in various environments, including cloud computing systems, an SGX enclave (a fine-grained ASLR break), and major operating systems. We further demonstrate that our attack can be used to infer user behavior, such as Bluetooth events and mouse movements. We highlight that stronger isolation or more fine-grained randomization should be adopted to successfully mitigate our presented attacks.

> It is well-known that recurrent neural networks (RNNs), although widely used, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks including one-frame attacks and multi-frame attacks. Though a few certified defenses exist to provide guaranteed robustness against one-frame attacks, we prove that defending against multi-frame attacks remains a challenging problem due to their enormous perturbation space. In this paper, we propose the first certified defense against multi-frame attacks for RNNs called RNN-Guard. To address the above challenge, we adopt the perturb-all-frame strategy to construct perturbation spaces consistent with those in multi-frame attacks. However, the perturb-all-frame strategy causes a precision issue in linear relaxations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel abstract domain called InterZono and design tighter relaxations. We prove that InterZono is more precise than Zonotope yet carries the same time complexity. Experimental evaluations across various datasets and model structures show that the certified robust accuracy calculated by RNN-Guard with InterZono is up to 2.18 times higher than that with Zonotope. In addition, we extend RNN-Guard as the first certified training method against multi-frame attacks to directly enhance RNNs' robustness. The results show that the certified robust accuracy of models trained with RNN-Guard against multi-frame attacks is 15.47 to 67.65 percentage points higher than those with other training methods.

> Proof-of-Learning (PoL) proposes that a model owner logs training checkpoints to establish a proof of having expended the computation necessary for training. The authors of PoL forego cryptographic approaches and trade rigorous security guarantees for scalability to deep learning. They empirically argued the benefit of this approach by showing how spoofing--computing a proof for a stolen model--is as expensive as obtaining the proof honestly by training the model. However, recent work has provided a counter-example and thus has invalidated this observation.   In this work we demonstrate, first, that while it is true that current PoL verification is not robust to adversaries, recent work has largely underestimated this lack of robustness. This is because existing spoofing strategies are either unreproducible or target weakened instantiations of PoL--meaning they are easily thwarted by changing hyperparameters of the verification. Instead, we introduce the first spoofing strategies that can be reproduced across different configurations of the PoL verification and can be done for a fraction of the cost of previous spoofing strategies. This is possible because we identify key vulnerabilities of PoL and systematically analyze the underlying assumptions needed for robust verification of a proof. On the theoretical side, we show how realizing these assumptions reduces to open problems in learning theory.We conclude that one cannot develop a provably robust PoL verification mechanism without further understanding of optimization in deep learning.

> Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a technology that identifies a modulation scheme without prior signal information and plays a vital role in various applications, including cognitive radio and link adaptation. With the development of deep learning (DL), DL-based AMC methods have emerged, while most of them focus on reducing computational complexity in a centralized structure. This centralized learning-based AMC (CentAMC) violates data privacy in the aspect of direct transmission of client-side raw data. Federated learning-based AMC (FedeAMC) can bypass this issue by exchanging model parameters, but causes large resultant latency and client-side computational load. Moreover, both CentAMC and FedeAMC are vulnerable to large-scale noise occured in the wireless channel between the client and the server. To this end, we develop a novel AMC method based on a split learning (SL) framework, coined SplitAMC, that can achieve high accuracy even in poor channel conditions, while guaranteeing data privacy and low latency. In SplitAMC, each client can benefit from data privacy leakage by exchanging smashed data and its gradient instead of raw data, and has robustness to noise with the help of high scale of smashed data. Numerical evaluations validate that SplitAMC outperforms CentAMC and FedeAMC in terms of accuracy for all SNRs as well as latency.

> Attacks against computer systems exploiting software vulnerabilities can cause substantial damage to the cyber-infrastructure of our modern society and economy. To minimize the consequences, it is vital to detect and fix vulnerabilities as soon as possible. Just-in-time vulnerability detection (JIT-VD) discovers vulnerability-prone ("dangerous") commits to prevent them from being merged into source code and causing vulnerabilities. By JIT-VD, the commits' authors, who understand the commits properly, can review these dangerous commits and fix them if necessary while the relevant modifications are still fresh in their minds. In this paper, we propose CodeJIT, a novel code-centric learning-based approach for just-in-time vulnerability detection. The key idea of CodeJIT is that the meaning of the code changes of a commit is the direct and deciding factor for determining if the commit is dangerous for the code. Based on that idea, we design a novel graph-based representation to represent the semantics of code changes in terms of both code structures and program dependencies. A graph neural network model is developed to capture the meaning of the code changes represented by our graph-based representation and learn to discriminate between dangerous and safe commits. We conducted experiments to evaluate the JIT-VD performance of CodeJIT on a dataset of 20K+ dangerous and safe commits in 506 real-world projects from 1998 to 2022. Our results show that CodeJIT significantly improves the state-of-the-art JIT-VD methods by up to 66% in Recall, 136% in Precision, and 68% in F1. Moreover, CodeJIT correctly classifies nearly 9/10 of dangerous/safe (benign) commits and even detects 69 commits that fix a vulnerability yet produce other issues in source code

> Learning large-scale industrial recommender system models by fitting them to historical user interaction data makes them vulnerable to conformity bias. This may be due to a number of factors, including the fact that user interests may be difficult to determine and that many items are often interacted with based on ecosystem factors other than their relevance to the individual user. In this work, we introduce CAM2, a conformity-aware multi-task ranking model to serve relevant items to users on one of the largest industrial recommendation platforms. CAM2 addresses these challenges systematically by leveraging causal modeling to disentangle users' conformity to popular items from their true interests. This framework is generalizable and can be scaled to support multiple representations of conformity and user relevance in any large-scale recommender system. We provide deeper practical insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through improvements in offline evaluation metrics compared to our production multi-task ranking model. We also show through online experiments that the CAM2 model results in a significant 0.50% increase in aggregated user engagement, coupled with a 0.21% increase in daily active users on Facebook Watch, a popular video discovery and sharing platform serving billions of users.

> Over the years, open-source software systems have become prey to threat actors. Even as open-source communities act quickly to patch the breach, code vulnerability screening should be an integral part of agile software development from the beginning. Unfortunately, current vulnerability screening techniques are ineffective at identifying novel vulnerabilities or providing developers with code vulnerability and classification. Furthermore, the datasets used for vulnerability learning often exhibit distribution shifts from the real-world testing distribution due to novel attack strategies deployed by adversaries and as a result, the machine learning model's performance may be hindered or biased. To address these issues, we propose a joint interpolated multitasked unbiased vulnerability classifier comprising a transformer "RoBERTa" and graph convolution neural network (GCN). We present a training process utilizing a semantic vulnerability graph (SVG) representation from source code, created by integrating edges from a sequential flow, control flow, and data flow, as well as a novel flow dubbed Poacher Flow (PF). Poacher flow edges reduce the gap between dynamic and static program analysis and handle complex long-range dependencies. Moreover, our approach reduces biases of classifiers regarding unbalanced datasets by integrating Focal Loss objective function along with SVG. Remarkably, experimental results show that our classifier outperforms state-of-the-art results on vulnerability detection with fewer false negatives and false positives. After testing our model across multiple datasets, it shows an improvement of at least 2.41% and 18.75% in the best-case scenario. Evaluations using N-day program samples demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a 93% accuracy and was able to detect 4, zero-day vulnerabilities from popular GitHub repositories.

> Road safety is a major global public health concern. Effective traffic crash prediction can play a critical role in reducing road traffic accidents. However, Existing machine learning approaches tend to focus on predicting traffic accidents in isolation, without considering the potential relationships between different accident locations within road networks. To incorporate graph structure information, graph-based approaches such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be naturally applied. However, applying GNNs to the accident prediction problem faces challenges due to the lack of suitable graph-structured traffic accident datasets. To bridge this gap, we have constructed a real-world graph-based Traffic Accident Prediction (TAP) data repository, along with two representative tasks: accident occurrence prediction and accident severity prediction. With nationwide coverage, real-world network topology, and rich geospatial features, this data repository can be used for a variety of traffic-related tasks. We further comprehensively evaluate eleven state-of-the-art GNN variants and two non-graph-based machine learning methods using the created datasets. Significantly facilitated by the proposed data, we develop a novel Traffic Accident Vulnerability Estimation via Linkage (TRAVEL) model, which is designed to capture angular and directional information from road networks. We demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms the baselines. The data and code are available on GitHub (https://github.com/baixianghuang/travel).

> Smart contracts are crucial elements of decentralized technologies, but they face significant obstacles to trustworthiness due to security bugs and trapdoors. To address the core issue, we propose a technology that enables programmers to focus on design-level properties rather than specific low-level attack patterns. Our proposed technology, called Theorem-Carrying-Transaction (TCT), combines the benefits of runtime checking and symbolic proof. Under the TCT protocol, every transaction must carry a theorem that proves its adherence to the safety properties in the invoked contracts, and the blockchain checks the proof before executing the transaction. The unique design of TCT ensures that the theorems are provable and checkable in an efficient manner. We believe that TCT holds a great promise for enabling provably secure smart contracts in the future. As such, we call for collaboration toward this vision.

> Localization has been a challenging task for autonomous navigation. A loop detection algorithm must overcome environmental changes for the place recognition and re-localization of robots. Therefore, deep learning has been extensively studied for the consistent transformation of measurements into localization descriptors. Street view images are easily accessible; however, images are vulnerable to appearance changes. LiDAR can robustly provide precise structural information. However, constructing a point cloud database is expensive, and point clouds exist only in limited places. Different from previous works that train networks to produce shared embedding directly between the 2D image and 3D point cloud, we transform both data into 2.5D depth images for matching. In this work, we propose a novel cross-matching method, called (LC)$^2$, for achieving LiDAR localization without a prior point cloud map. To this end, LiDAR measurements are expressed in the form of range images before matching them to reduce the modality discrepancy. Subsequently, the network is trained to extract localization descriptors from disparity and range images. Next, the best matches are employed as a loop factor in a pose graph. Using public datasets that include multiple sessions in significantly different lighting conditions, we demonstrated that LiDAR-based navigation systems could be optimized from image databases and vice versa.

> Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems have emerged as a promising solution for building security-sensitive applications. However, bugs in ZK applications are extremely difficult to detect and can allow a malicious party to silently exploit the system without leaving any observable trace. This paper presents Coda, a novel statically-typed language for building zero-knowledge applications. Critically, Coda makes it possible to formally specify and statically check properties of a ZK application through a rich refinement type system. One of the key challenges in formally verifying ZK applications is that they require reasoning about polynomial equations over large prime fields that go beyond the capabilities of automated theorem provers. Coda mitigates this challenge by generating a set of Coq lemmas that can be proven in an interactive manner with the help of a tactic library. We have used Coda to re-implement 79 arithmetic circuits from widely-used Circom libraries and applications. Our evaluation shows that Coda makes it possible to specify important and formally verify correctness properties of these circuits. Our evaluation also revealed 6 previously-unknown vulnerabilities in the original Circom projects.

> Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used extensively for automatic modulation classification (AMC), and the results have been quite promising. However, DNNs have high memory and computation requirements making them impractical for edge networks where the devices are resource-constrained. They are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which is a significant security concern. This work proposes a rotated binary large ResNet (RBLResNet) for AMC that can be deployed at the edge network because of low memory and computational complexity. The performance gap between the RBLResNet and existing architectures with floating-point weights and activations can be closed by two proposed ensemble methods: (i) multilevel classification (MC), and (ii) bagging multiple RBLResNets while retaining low memory and computational power. The MC method achieves an accuracy of $93.39\%$ at $10$dB over all the $24$ modulation classes of the Deepsig dataset. This performance is comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances, with $4.75$ times lower memory and $1214$ times lower computation. Furthermore, RBLResNet also has high adversarial robustness compared to existing DNN models. The proposed MC method with RBLResNets has an adversarial accuracy of $87.25\%$ over a wide range of SNRs, surpassing the robustness of all existing SOTA methods to the best of our knowledge. Properties such as low memory, low computation, and the highest adversarial robustness make it a better choice for robust AMC in low-power edge devices.

> In the past few years, it has become increasingly evident that deep neural networks are not resilient enough to withstand adversarial perturbations in input data, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Various authors have proposed strong adversarial attacks for computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. As a response, many defense mechanisms have also been proposed to prevent these networks from failing. The significance of defending neural networks against adversarial attacks lies in ensuring that the model's predictions remain unchanged even if the input data is perturbed. Several methods for adversarial defense in NLP have been proposed, catering to different NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and natural language inference. Some of these methods not only defend neural networks against adversarial attacks but also act as a regularization mechanism during training, saving the model from overfitting. This survey aims to review the various methods proposed for adversarial defenses in NLP over the past few years by introducing a novel taxonomy. The survey also highlights the fragility of advanced deep neural networks in NLP and the challenges involved in defending them.

> Neural text ranking models have witnessed significant advancement and are increasingly being deployed in practice. Unfortunately, they also inherit adversarial vulnerabilities of general neural models, which have been detected but remain underexplored by prior studies. Moreover, the inherit adversarial vulnerabilities might be leveraged by blackhat SEO to defeat better-protected search engines. In this study, we propose an imitation adversarial attack on black-box neural passage ranking models. We first show that the target passage ranking model can be transparentized and imitated by enumerating critical queries/candidates and then train a ranking imitation model. Leveraging the ranking imitation model, we can elaborately manipulate the ranking results and transfer the manipulation attack to the target ranking model. For this purpose, we propose an innovative gradient-based attack method, empowered by the pairwise objective function, to generate adversarial triggers, which causes premeditated disorderliness with very few tokens. To equip the trigger camouflages, we add the next sentence prediction loss and the language model fluency constraint to the objective function. Experimental results on passage ranking demonstrate the effectiveness of the ranking imitation attack model and adversarial triggers against various SOTA neural ranking models. Furthermore, various mitigation analyses and human evaluation show the effectiveness of camouflages when facing potential mitigation approaches. To motivate other scholars to further investigate this novel and important problem, we make the experiment data and code publicly available.

> In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have achieved significant progress in many domains, such as autonomous driving, facial recognition, and speech recognition. However, the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks has raised serious concerns in the community because of their insufficient robustness and generalization. Also, transferable attacks have become a prominent method for black-box attacks. In this work, we explore the potential factors that impact adversarial examples (AEs) transferability in DL-based speech recognition. We also discuss the vulnerability of different DL systems and the irregular nature of decision boundaries. Our results show a remarkable difference in the transferability of AEs between speech and images, with the data relevance being low in images but opposite in speech recognition. Motivated by dropout-based ensemble approaches, we propose random gradient ensembles and dynamic gradient-weighted ensembles, and we evaluate the impact of ensembles on the transferability of AEs. The results show that the AEs created by both approaches are valid for transfer to the black box API.

- *Khushbu Khatri Park, Abdulaziz Ahmed, Mohammed Ali Al-Garadi*

- `2304.09233v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09233v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09233v1)

> Background: The use of machine learning (ML) in mental health (MH) research is increasing, especially as new, more complex data types become available to analyze. By systematically examining the published literature, this review aims to uncover potential gaps in the current use of ML to study MH in vulnerable populations of immigrants, refugees, migrants, and racial and ethnic minorities.   Methods: In this systematic review, we queried Google Scholar for ML-related terms, MH-related terms, and a population of a focus search term strung together with Boolean operators. Backward reference searching was also conducted. Included peer-reviewed studies reported using a method or application of ML in an MH context and focused on the populations of interest. We did not have date cutoffs. Publications were excluded if they were narrative or did not exclusively focus on a minority population from the respective country. Data including study context, the focus of mental healthcare, sample, data type, type of ML algorithm used, and algorithm performance was extracted from each.   Results: Our search strategies resulted in 67,410 listed articles from Google Scholar. Ultimately, 12 were included. All the articles were published within the last 6 years, and half of them studied populations within the US. Most reviewed studies used supervised learning to explain or predict MH outcomes. Some publications used up to 16 models to determine the best predictive power. Almost half of the included publications did not discuss their cross-validation method.   Conclusions: The included studies provide proof-of-concept for the potential use of ML algorithms to address MH concerns in these special populations, few as they may be. Our systematic review finds that the clinical application of these models for classifying and predicting MH disorders is still under development.

> Vulnerability management strategy, from both organizational and public policy perspectives, hinges on an understanding of the supply of undiscovered vulnerabilities. If the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is small enough, then a reasonable investment strategy would be to focus on finding and removing the remaining undiscovered vulnerabilities. If the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is and will continue to be large, then a better investment strategy would be to focus on quick patch dissemination and engineering resilient systems. This paper examines a paradigm, namely that the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is manageably small, through the lens of mathematical concepts from the theory of computing. From this perspective, we find little support for the paradigm of limited undiscovered vulnerabilities. We then briefly support the notion that these theory-based conclusions are relevant to practical computers in use today. We find no reason to believe undiscovered vulnerabilities are not essentially unlimited in practice and we examine the possible economic impacts should this be the case. Based on our analysis, we recommend vulnerability management strategy adopts an approach favoring quick patch dissemination and engineering resilient systems, while continuing good software engineering practices to reduce (but never eliminate) vulnerabilities in information systems.

> Pre-trained programming language (PL) models (such as CodeT5, CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, etc.,) have the potential to automate software engineering tasks involving code understanding and code generation. However, these models operate in the natural channel of code, i.e., they are primarily concerned with the human understanding of the code. They are not robust to changes in the input and thus, are potentially susceptible to adversarial attacks in the natural channel. We propose, CodeAttack, a simple yet effective black-box attack model that uses code structure to generate effective, efficient, and imperceptible adversarial code samples and demonstrates the vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art PL models to code-specific adversarial attacks. We evaluate the transferability of CodeAttack on several code-code (translation and repair) and code-NL (summarization) tasks across different programming languages. CodeAttack outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial NLP attack models to achieve the best overall drop in performance while being more efficient, imperceptible, consistent, and fluent.

> Secure computation is of critical importance to not only the DoD, but across financial institutions, healthcare, and anywhere personally identifiable information (PII) is accessed. Traditional security techniques require data to be decrypted before performing any computation. When processed on untrusted systems the decrypted data is vulnerable to attacks to extract the sensitive information. To address these vulnerabilities Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) keeps the data encrypted during computation and secures the results, even in these untrusted environments. However, FHE requires a significant amount of computation to perform equivalent unencrypted operations. To be useful, FHE must significantly close the computation gap (within 10x) to make encrypted processing practical. To accomplish this ambitious goal the TREBUCHET project is leading research and development in FHE processing hardware to accelerate deep computations on encrypted data, as part of the DARPA MTO Data Privacy for Virtual Environments (DPRIVE) program. We accelerate the major secure standardized FHE schemes (BGV, BFV, CKKS, FHEW, etc.) at >=128-bit security while integrating with the open-source PALISADE and OpenFHE libraries currently used in the DoD and in industry. We utilize a novel tile-based chip design with highly parallel ALUs optimized for vectorized 128b modulo arithmetic. The TREBUCHET coprocessor design provides a highly modular, flexible, and extensible FHE accelerator for easy reconfiguration, deployment, integration and application on other hardware form factors, such as System-on-Chip or alternate chip areas.

> Split learning of deep neural networks (SplitNN) has provided a promising solution to learning jointly for the mutual interest of a guest and a host, which may come from different backgrounds, holding features partitioned vertically. However, SplitNN creates a new attack surface for the adversarial participant, holding back its practical use in the real world. By investigating the adversarial effects of highly threatening attacks, including property inference, data reconstruction, and feature hijacking attacks, we identify the underlying vulnerability of SplitNN and propose a countermeasure. To prevent potential threats and ensure the learning guarantees of SplitNN, we design a privacy-preserving tunnel for information exchange between the guest and the host. The intuition is to perturb the propagation of knowledge in each direction with a controllable unified solution. To this end, we propose a new activation function named R3eLU, transferring private smashed data and partial loss into randomized responses in forward and backward propagations, respectively. We give the first attempt to secure split learning against three threatening attacks and present a fine-grained privacy budget allocation scheme. The analysis proves that our privacy-preserving SplitNN solution provides a tight privacy budget, while the experimental results show that our solution performs better than existing solutions in most cases and achieves a good tradeoff between defense and model usability.

> In recent years, large language models have been responsible for great advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). ChatGPT in particular, an AI chatbot developed and recently released by OpenAI, has taken the field to the next level. The conversational model is able not only to process human-like text, but also to translate natural language into code. However, the safety of programs generated by ChatGPT should not be overlooked. In this paper, we perform an experiment to address this issue. Specifically, we ask ChatGPT to generate a number of program and evaluate the security of the resulting source code. We further investigate whether ChatGPT can be prodded to improve the security by appropriate prompts, and discuss the ethical aspects of using AI to generate code. Results suggest that ChatGPT is aware of potential vulnerabilities, but nonetheless often generates source code that are not robust to certain attacks.

> Recently, blockchain has been applied in various fields to secure data exchanges and storage in decentralized systems. In a blockchain application where the task of the application which makes use of the data stored in a blockchain has to be accomplished by a time instant, the employed blockchain is essentially finitely-long. In this paper, we consider a general finitely-long blockchain model which is generalized from most existing works on finitely-long blockchain applications, and take the first step towards characterizing the vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains in securing data against double-spending attacks. For the first time, we develop a general closed-form expression for the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain. This probability essentially characterizes the vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains. Then, we prove that the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain is no greater than that on an infinitely-long blockchain, which implies that finitely-long blockchains are less vulnerable to double-spending attacks than infinitely-long blockchains. Moreover, we show that unlike infinitely-long blockchains which can be surely paralyzed by a 51% attack, finitely-long blockchains are more resistant to 51% attacks.

> Some bugs cannot be exposed by program inputs, but only by certain program environments. During execution, most programs access various resources, like databases, files, or devices, that are external to the program and thus part of the program's environment. In this paper, we present a coverage-guided, mutation-based environment synthesis approach of bug-inducing program environments. Specifically, we observe that programs interact with their environment via dedicated system calls and propose to intercept these system calls (i) to capture the resources accessed during the first execution of an input as initial program environment, and (ii) mutate copies of these resources during subsequent executions of that input to generate slightly changed program environments. Any generated environment that is observed to increase coverage is added to the corpus of environment seeds and becomes subject to further fuzzing. Bug-inducing program environments are reported to the user.   Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We implemented a prototype called AFLChaos which found bugs in the resource-handling code of five (5) of the seven (7) open source projects in our benchmark set (incl. OpenSSL). Automatically, AFLChaos generated environments consisting of bug-inducing databases used for storing information, bug-inducing multimedia files used for streaming, bug-inducing cryptographic keys used for encryption, and bug-inducing configuration files used to configure the program. To support open science, we publish the experimental infrastructure, our tool, and all data.

> Recently, studies show that deep learning-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which add a small amount of noise to the original audio examples. These AE attacks pose new challenges to deep learning security and have raised significant concerns about deploying ASR systems and devices. The existing defense methods are either limited in application or only defend on results, but not on process. In this work, we propose a novel method to infer the adversary intent and discover audio adversarial examples based on the AEs generation process. The insight of this method is based on the observation: many existing audio AE attacks utilize query-based methods, which means the adversary must send continuous and similar queries to target ASR models during the audio AE generation process. Inspired by this observation, We propose a memory mechanism by adopting audio fingerprint technology to analyze the similarity of the current query with a certain length of memory query. Thus, we can identify when a sequence of queries appears to be suspectable to generate audio AEs. Through extensive evaluation on four state-of-the-art audio AE attacks, we demonstrate that on average our defense identify the adversary intent with over 90% accuracy. With careful regard for robustness evaluations, we also analyze our proposed defense and its strength to withstand two adaptive attacks. Finally, our scheme is available out-of-the-box and directly compatible with any ensemble of ASR defense models to uncover audio AE attacks effectively without model retraining.

> Deep learning based semantic communication(DLSC) systems have shown great potential of making wireless networks significantly more efficient by only transmitting the semantics of the data. However, the open nature of wireless channel and fragileness of neural models cause DLSC systems extremely vulnerable to various attacks. Traditional wireless physical layer key (PLK), which relies on reciprocal channel and randomness characteristics between two legitimate users, holds the promise of securing DLSC. The main challenge lies in generating secret keys in the static environment with ultra-low/zero rate. Different from prior efforts that use relays or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to manipulate wireless channels, this paper proposes a novel physical layer semantic encryption scheme by exploring the randomness of bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores in the field of machine translation, and additionally presents a novel semantic obfuscation mechanism to provide further physical layer protections. Specifically, 1) we calculate the BLEU scores and corresponding weights of the DLSC system. Then, we generate semantic keys (SKey) by feeding the weighted sum of the scores into a hash function. 2) Equipped with the SKey, our proposed subcarrier obfuscation is able to further secure semantic communications with a dynamic dummy data insertion mechanism. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method, especially in the static wireless environment.

> Industry 4.0 is a blend of the hyper-connected digital industry within two world of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). With this amalgamate opportunity, smart manufacturing involves production assets with the manufacturing equipment having its own intelligence, while the system-wide intelligence is provided by the cyber layer. However Smart manufacturing now becomes one of the prime targets of cyber threats due to vulnerabilities in the existing process of operation. Since smart manufacturing covers a vast area of production industries from cyber physical system to additive manufacturing, to autonomous vehicles, to cloud based IIoT (Industrial IoT), to robotic production, cyber threat stands out with this regard questioning about how to connect manufacturing resources by network, how to integrate a whole process chain for a factory production etc. Cybersecurity confidentiality, integrity and availability expose their essential existence for the proper operational thread model known as digital thread ensuring secure manufacturing. In this work, a literature survey is presented from the existing threat models, attack vectors and future challenges over the digital thread of smart manufacturing.

> As smart buildings move towards open communication technologies, providing access to the Building Automation System (BAS) through the intranet, or even remotely through the Internet, has become a common practice. However, BAS was historically developed as a closed environment and designed with limited cyber-security considerations. Thus, smart buildings are vulnerable to cyber-attacks with the increased accessibility. This study introduces the development and capability of a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testbed for testing and evaluating the cyber-physical security of typical BASs in smart buildings. The testbed consists of three subsystems: (1) a real-time HIL emulator simulating the behavior of a virtual building as well as the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment via a dynamic simulation in Modelica; (2) a set of real HVAC controllers monitoring the virtual building operation and providing local control signals to control HVAC equipment in the HIL emulator; and (3) a BAS server along with a web-based service for users to fully access the schedule, setpoints, trends, alarms, and other control functions of the HVAC controllers remotely through the BACnet network. The server generates rule-based setpoints to local HVAC controllers. Based on these three subsystems, the HIL testbed supports attack/fault-free and attack/fault-injection experiments at various levels of the building system. The resulting test data can be used to inform the building community and support the cyber-physical security technology transfer to the building industry.

> Broken access control is one of the most common security vulnerabilities in web applications. These vulnerabilities are the major cause of many data breach incidents, which result in privacy concern and revenue loss. However, preventing and detecting access control vulnerabilities proactively in web applications could be difficult. Currently, these vulnerabilities are actively detected by bug bounty hunters post-deployment, which creates attack windows for malicious access. To solve this problem proactively requires security awareness and expertise from developers, which calls for systematic solutions.   This survey targets to provide a structured overview of approaches that tackle access control vulnerabilities. It firstly discusses the unique feature of access control vulnerabilities, then studies the existing works proposed to tackle access control vulnerabilities in web applications, which span the spectrum of software development from software design and implementation, software analysis and testing, and runtime monitoring. At last we discuss the open problem in this field.

> Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative deep learning training across multiple participants without exposing sensitive personal data. However, the distributed nature of FL and the unvetted participants' data makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks. In these attacks, adversaries inject malicious functionality into the centralized model during training, leading to intentional misclassifications for specific adversary-chosen inputs. While previous research has demonstrated successful injections of persistent backdoors in FL, the persistence also poses a challenge, as their existence in the centralized model can prompt the central aggregation server to take preventive measures to penalize the adversaries. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology that enables adversaries to effectively remove backdoors from the centralized model upon achieving their objectives or upon suspicion of possible detection. The proposed approach extends the concept of machine unlearning and presents strategies to preserve the performance of the centralized model and simultaneously prevent over-unlearning of information unrelated to backdoor patterns, making the adversaries stealthy while removing backdoors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores machine unlearning in FL to remove backdoors to the benefit of adversaries. Exhaustive evaluation considering image classification scenarios demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method in efficient backdoor removal from the centralized model, injected by state-of-the-art attacks across multiple configurations.

> Deep learning achieves outstanding results in many machine learning tasks. Nevertheless, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks that modify the training set to embed a secret functionality in the trained model. The modified training samples have a secret property, i. e., a trigger. At inference time, the secret functionality is activated when the input contains the trigger, while the model functions correctly in other cases. While there are many known backdoor attacks (and defenses), deploying a stealthy attack is still far from trivial. Successfully creating backdoor triggers depends on numerous parameters. Unfortunately, research has not yet determined which parameters contribute most to the attack performance.   This paper systematically analyzes the most relevant parameters for the backdoor attacks, i.e., trigger size, position, color, and poisoning rate. Using transfer learning, which is very common in computer vision, we evaluate the attack on state-of-the-art models (ResNet, VGG, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet) and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, and TinyImageNet). Our attacks cover the majority of backdoor settings in research, providing concrete directions for future works. Our code is publicly available to facilitate the reproducibility of our results.

> The transient execution attack is a type of attack leveraging the vulnerability of modern CPU optimization technologies. New attacks surface rapidly. The side-channel is a key part of transient execution attacks to leak data. In this work, we discover a vulnerability that the change of the EFLAGS register in transient execution may have a side effect on the Jcc (jump on condition code) instruction after it in Intel CPUs. Based on our discovery, we propose a new side-channel attack that leverages the timing of both transient execution and Jcc instructions to deliver data. This attack encodes secret data to the change of register which makes the execution time of context slightly slower, which can be measured by the attacker to decode data. This attack doesn't rely on the cache system and doesn't need to reset the EFLAGS register manually to its initial state before the attack, which may make it more difficult to detect or mitigate. We implemented this side-channel on machines with Intel Core i7-6700, i7-7700, and i9-10980XE CPUs. In the first two processors, we combined it as the side-channel of the Meltdown attack, which could achieve 100\% success leaking rate. We evaluate and discuss potential defenses against the attack. Our contributions include discovering security vulnerabilities in the implementation of Jcc instructions and EFLAGS register and proposing a new side-channel attack that does not rely on the cache system.

ANALYSE is a modular, configurable, and self-documenting framework designed to find yet unknown attack types and to reproduce many known attack strategies in cyber-physical energy systems from the scientific literature.

> We propose a method combining machine learning with a static analysis tool (i.e. Infer) to automatically repair source code. Machine Learning methods perform well for producing idiomatic source code. However, their output is sometimes difficult to trust as language models can output incorrect code with high confidence. Static analysis tools are trustable, but also less flexible and produce non-idiomatic code. In this paper, we propose to fix resource leak bugs in IR space, and to use a sequence-to-sequence model to propose fix in source code space. We also study several decoding strategies, and use Infer to filter the output of the model. On a dataset of CodeNet submissions with potential resource leak bugs, our method is able to find a function with the same semantics that does not raise a warning with around 97% precision and 66% recall.

We propose secure rollback of isolated domains as an efficient and secure method of improving the resilience of software targeted by run-time attacks. We show the practicability of our methodology by realizing a software library for Secure Domain Rollback (SDRoB) and demonstrate how SDRoB can be applied to real-world software.

In this work, we train transformers to perform modular arithmetic and combine half-trained models with statistical cryptanalysis techniques to propose SALSA: a machine learning attack on LWE-based cryptographic schemes. SALSA can fully recover secrets for small-to-mid size LWE instances with sparse binary secrets, and may scale to attack real-world LWE-based cryptosystems.

> The open data ecosystem is susceptible to vulnerabilities due to disclosure risks. Though the datasets are anonymized during release, the prevalence of the release-and-forget model makes the data defenders blind to privacy issues arising after the dataset release. One such issue can be the disclosure risks in the presence of newly released datasets which may compromise the privacy of the data subjects of the anonymous open datasets. In this paper, we first examine some of these pitfalls through the examples we observed during a red teaming exercise and then envision other possible vulnerabilities in this context. We also discuss proactive risk monitoring, including developing a collection of highly susceptible open datasets and a visual analytic workflow that empowers data defenders towards undertaking dynamic risk calibration strategies.

> The Japanese notion of "kawaii" or expressions of cuteness, vulnerability, and/or charm is a global cultural export. Work has explored kawaii-ness as a design feature and factor of user experience in the visual appearance, nonverbal behaviour, and sound of robots and virtual characters. In this initial work, we consider whether voices can be kawaii by exploring the vocal qualities of voice assistant speech, i.e., kawaii vocalics. Drawing from an age-inclusive model of kawaii, we ran a user perceptions study on the kawaii-ness of younger- and older-sounding Japanese computer voices. We found that kawaii-ness intersected with perceptions of gender and age, i.e., gender ambiguous and girlish, as well as VA features, i.e., fluency and artificiality. We propose an initial model of kawaii vocalics to be validated through the identification and study of vocal qualities, cognitive appraisals, behavioural responses, and affective reports.

> Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a cloud-edge collaboration paradigm that enables edge nodes, comprising resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to cooperatively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while retaining their data locally. This paradigm facilitates improved privacy and security for edges and IoT devices, making VFL an essential component of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) systems. Nevertheless, the partitioned structure of VFL can be exploited by adversaries to inject a backdoor, enabling them to manipulate the VFL predictions. In this paper, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of VFL in the context of binary classification tasks. To this end, we define a threat model for backdoor attacks in VFL and introduce a universal adversarial backdoor (UAB) attack to poison the predictions of VFL. The UAB attack, consisting of universal trigger generation and clean-label backdoor injection, is incorporated during the VFL training at specific iterations. This is achieved by alternately optimizing the universal trigger and model parameters of VFL sub-problems. Our work distinguishes itself from existing studies on designing backdoor attacks for VFL, as those require the knowledge of auxiliary information not accessible within the split VFL architecture. In contrast, our approach does not necessitate any additional data to execute the attack. On the LendingClub and Zhongyuan datasets, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 100\% backdoor task performance while maintaining the main task performance. Our results in this paper make a major advance to revealing the hidden backdoor risks of VFL, hence paving the way for the future development of secure AIoT.

> The drone has been used for various purposes, including military applications, aerial photography, and pesticide spraying. However, the drone is vulnerable to external disturbances, and malfunction in propellers and motors can easily occur. To improve the safety of drone operations, one should detect the mechanical faults of drones in real-time. This paper proposes a sound-based deep neural network (DNN) fault classifier and drone sound dataset. The dataset was constructed by collecting the operating sounds of drones from microphones mounted on three different drones in an anechoic chamber. The dataset includes various operating conditions of drones, such as flight directions (front, back, right, left, clockwise, counterclockwise) and faults on propellers and motors. The drone sounds were then mixed with noises recorded in five different spots on the university campus, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varying from 10 dB to 15 dB. Using the acquired dataset, we train a DNN classifier, 1DCNN-ResNet, that classifies the types of mechanical faults and their locations from short-time input waveforms. We employ multitask learning (MTL) and incorporate the direction classification task as an auxiliary task to make the classifier learn more general audio features. The test over unseen data reveals that the proposed multitask model can successfully classify faults in drones and outperforms single-task models even with less training data.

> Smart grid is the modern two way mechanism combining the power grid, control center, smart metering facility, energy routing and customer demand response services. The system being complicated, security vulnerabilities are paramount for the sound operation and process continuation. Since smart grid connects with the end user to the energy providers, these two parties can interact with each other within the whole energy management work flow. In this regard, game theory provides effective insights in the analysis of security measures for smart grid. The mentioned parties will be the players in the game model to provide a solution for the various threats to the grid aspects. In this work, a brief review has presented with the existing approaches to the threat models for divergent sectors of the smart grid. The solution approaches to these threats are based on the game theoretical approaches that connect the attackers and defenders in the scenarios.

> While Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various tasks, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Several techniques have been developed to verify the adversarial robustness of FNNs, but most of them focus on robustness verification against the local perturbation neighborhood of a single data point. There is still a large research gap in global robustness analysis. The global-robustness verifiable framework DeepGlobal has been proposed to identify \textit{all} possible Adversarial Dangerous Regions (ADRs) of FNNs, not limited to data samples in a test set. In this paper, we propose a complete specification and implementation of DeepGlobal utilizing the SMT solver Z3 for more explicit definition, and propose several improvements to DeepGlobal for more efficient verification. To evaluate the effectiveness of our implementation and improvements, we conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmark datasets. Visualization of our experiment results shows the validity and effectiveness of the approach.

> Docker offers an ecosystem that offers a platform for application packaging, distributing, and managing within containers. However, the Docker platform has not yet matured. Presently, Docker is less secured than virtual machines (VM) and most of the other cloud technologies. The key to Dockers inadequate security protocols is container sharing of Linux kernel, which can lead to the risk of privileged escalations. This research will outline some significant security vulnerabilities at Docker and counter solutions to neutralize such attacks. There are a variety of security attacks like insider and outsider. This research will outline both types of attacks and their mitigations strategies. Taking some precautionary measures can save from massive disasters. This research will also present Docker secure deployment guidelines. These guidelines will suggest different configurations to deploy Docker containers in a more secure way.

> Dataflow computing was shown to bring significant benefits to multiple niches of systems engineering and has the potential to become a general-purpose paradigm of choice for data-driven application development. One of the characteristic features of dataflow computing is the natural access to the dataflow graph of the entire system. Recently it has been observed that these dataflow graphs can be treated as complete graphical causal models, opening opportunities to apply causal inference techniques to dataflow systems. In this demonstration paper we aim to provide the first practical validation of this idea with a particular focus on causal fault localisation. We provide multiple demonstrations of how causal inference can be used to detect software bugs and data shifts in multiple scenarios with three modern dataflow engines.

> Almost 50 years after the invention of SQL, injection attacks are still top-tier vulnerabilities of today's ICT systems. Consequently, SQLi detection is still an active area of research, where the most recent works incorporate machine learning techniques into the proposed solutions. In this work, we highlight the shortcomings of the previous ML-based results focusing on four aspects: the evaluation methods, the optimization of the model parameters, the distribution of utilized datasets, and the feature selection. Since no single work explored all of these aspects satisfactorily, we fill this gap and provide an in-depth and comprehensive empirical analysis. Moreover, we cross-validate the trained models by using data from other distributions. This aspect of ML models (trained for SQLi detection) was never studied. Yet, the sensitivity of the model's performance to this is crucial for any real-life deployment. Finally, we validate our findings on a real-world industrial SQLi dataset.

> A successful automated program proof is, in software verification, the ultimate triumph. In practice, however, the road to such success is paved with many failed proof attempts. Unlike a failed test, which provides concrete evidence of an actual bug in the program, a failed proof leaves the programmer in the dark. Can we instead learn something useful from it?   The work reported here takes advantage of the rich internal information that some automatic provers collect about the program when attempting a proof. If the proof fails, the Proof2Test tool presented in this article uses the counterexample generated by the prover (specifically, the SMT solver underlying the proof environment Boogie, used in the AutoProof system to perform correctness proofs of contract-equipped Eiffel programs) to produce a failed test, which provides the programmer with immediately exploitable information to correct the program. The discussion presents the Proof2Test tool and demonstrates the application of the ideas and tool to a collection of representative examples.

> In software development, due to the lack of knowledge or information, time pressure, complex context, and many other factors, various uncertainties emerge during the development process, leading to assumptions scattered in projects. Being unaware of certain assumptions can result in critical problems (e.g., system vulnerability and failures). The prerequisite of analyzing and understanding assumptions in software development is to identify and extract those assumptions with acceptable effort. In this paper, we proposed a tool (i.e., Assumption Miner) to automatically identify and extract assumptions on GitHub projects. To evaluate the applicability of Assumption Miner, we first presented an example of using the tool to mine assumptions from one large and popular deep learning framework project: the TensorFlow project on GitHub. We then conducted an evaluation of the tool. The results show that Assumption Miner can effectively identify and extract assumptions from the repositories on GitHub.

> Recent years have witnessed explosive growth in blockchain smart contract applications. As smart contracts become increasingly popular and carry trillion dollars worth of digital assets, they become more of an appealing target for attackers, who have exploited vulnerabilities in smart contracts to cause catastrophic economic losses. Notwithstanding a proliferation of work that has been developed to detect an impressive list of vulnerabilities, the bad randomness vulnerability is overlooked by many existing tools. In this paper, we make the first attempt to provide a systematic analysis of random numbers in Ethereum smart contracts, by investigating the principles behind pseudo-random number generation and organizing them into a taxonomy. We also lucubrate various attacks against bad random numbers and group them into four categories. Furthermore, we present RNVulDet - a tool that incorporates taint analysis techniques to automatically identify bad randomness vulnerabilities and detect corresponding attack transactions. To extensively verify the effectiveness of RNVulDet, we construct three new datasets: i) 34 well-known contracts that are reported to possess bad randomness vulnerabilities, ii) 214 popular contracts that have been rigorously audited before launch and are regarded as free of bad randomness vulnerabilities, and iii) a dataset consisting of 47,668 smart contracts and 49,951 suspicious transactions. We compare RNVulDet with three state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detectors, and our tool significantly outperforms them. Meanwhile, RNVulDet spends 2.98s per contract on average, in most cases orders-of-magnitude faster than other tools. RNVulDet successfully reveals 44,264 attack transactions. Our implementation and datasets are released, hoping to inspire others.

> When debugging unintended program behavior, developers can often identify the point in the execution where the actual behavior diverges from the desired behavior. For example, a variable may get assigned a wrong value, which then negatively influences the remaining computation. Once a developer identifies such a divergence, how to fix the code so that it provides the desired behavior? This paper presents TraceFixer, a technique for predicting how to edit source code so that it does not diverge from the expected behavior anymore. The key idea is to train a neural program repair model that not only learns from source code edits but also exploits excerpts of runtime traces. The input to the model is a partial execution trace of the incorrect code, which can be obtained automatically through code instrumentation, and the correct state that the program should reach at the divergence point, which the user provides, e.g., in an interactive debugger. Our approach fundamentally differs from current program repair techniques, which share a similar goal but exploit neither execution traces nor information about the desired program state. We evaluate TraceFixer on single-line mistakes in Python code. After training the model on hundreds of thousands of code edits created by a neural model that mimics real-world bugs, we find that exploiting execution traces improves the bug-fixing ability by 13% to 20% (depending on the dataset, within the top-10 predictions) compared to a baseline that learns from source code edits only. Applying TraceFixer to 20 real-world Python bugs shows that the approach successfully fixes 10 of them.

> Reducing the memory footprint of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is essential to enable their deployment into resource-constrained tiny devices. However, a disadvantage of DNN models is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, as they can be fooled by adding slight perturbations to the inputs. Therefore, the challenge is how to create accurate, robust, and tiny DNN models deployable on resource-constrained embedded devices. This paper reports the results of devising a tiny DNN model, robust to adversarial black and white box attacks, trained with an automatic quantizationaware training framework, i.e. QKeras, with deep quantization loss accounted in the learning loop, thereby making the designed DNNs more accurate for deployment on tiny devices. We investigated how QKeras and an adversarial robustness technique, Jacobian Regularization (JR), can provide a co-optimization strategy by exploiting the DNN topology and the per layer JR approach to produce robust yet tiny deeply quantized DNN models. As a result, a new DNN model implementing this cooptimization strategy was conceived, developed and tested on three datasets containing both images and audio inputs, as well as compared its performance with existing benchmarks against various white-box and black-box attacks. Experimental results demonstrated that on average our proposed DNN model resulted in 8.3% and 79.5% higher accuracy than MLCommons/Tiny benchmarks in the presence of white-box and black-box attacks on the CIFAR-10 image dataset and a subset of the Google Speech Commands audio dataset respectively. It was also 6.5% more accurate for black-box attacks on the SVHN image dataset.

> Machine learning (ML), including deep learning, has recently gained tremendous popularity in a wide range of applications. However, like traditional software, ML applications are not immune to the bugs that result from programming errors. Explicit programming errors usually manifest through error messages and stack traces. These stack traces describe the chain of function calls that lead to an anomalous situation, or exception. Indeed, these exceptions may cross the entire software stack (including applications and libraries). Thus, studying the patterns in stack traces can help practitioners and researchers understand the causes of exceptions in ML applications and the challenges faced by ML developers. To that end, we mine Stack Overflow (SO) and study 11,449 stack traces related to seven popular Python ML libraries. First, we observe that ML questions that contain stack traces gain more popularity than questions without stack traces; however, they are less likely to get accepted answers. Second, we observe that recurrent patterns exists in ML stack traces, even across different ML libraries, with a small portion of patterns covering many stack traces. Third, we derive five high-level categories and 25 low-level types from the stack trace patterns: most patterns are related to python basic syntax, model training, parallelization, data transformation, and subprocess invocation. Furthermore, the patterns related to subprocess invocation, external module execution, and remote API call are among the least likely to get accepted answers on SO. Our findings provide insights for researchers, ML library providers, and ML application developers to improve the quality of ML libraries and their applications.

> With blockchain technology rapidly progress, the smart contracts have become a common tool in a number of industries including finance, healthcare, insurance and gaming. The number of smart contracts has multiplied, and at the same time, the security of smart contracts has drawn considerable attention due to the monetary losses brought on by smart contract vulnerabilities. Existing analysis techniques are capable of identifying a large number of smart contract security flaws, but they rely too much on rigid criteria established by specialists, where the detection process takes much longer as the complexity of the smart contract rises. In this paper, we propose HyMo as a multi-modal hybrid deep learning model, which intelligently considers various input representations to consider multimodality and FastText word embedding technique, which represents each word as an n-gram of characters with BiGRU deep learning technique, as a sequence processing model that consists of two GRUs to achieve higher accuracy in smart contract vulnerability detection. The model gathers features using various deep learning models to identify the smart contract vulnerabilities. Through a series of studies on the currently publicly accessible dataset such as ScrawlD, we show that our hybrid HyMo model has excellent smart contract vulnerability detection performance. Therefore, HyMo performs better detection of smart contract vulnerabilities against other approaches.

> Intensified preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lockdown and social distancing, heavily increased the perception of social isolation (i.e., a discrepancy between one's social needs and the provisions of the social environment) among young adults. Social isolation is closely associated with situational loneliness (i.e., loneliness emerging from environmental change), a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Prior research suggested vulnerable young adults are likely to seek support from an online social platform such as Reddit, a perceived comfortable environment for lonely individuals to seek mental health help through anonymous communication with a broad social network. Therefore, this study aims to identify and analyze depression-related dialogues on loneliness subreddits during the COVID-19 outbreak, with the implications on depression-related infoveillance during the pandemic. Our study utilized logistic regression and topic modeling to classify and examine depression-related discussions on loneliness subreddits before and during the pandemic. Our results showed significant increases in the volume of depression-related discussions (i.e., topics related to mental health, social interaction, family, and emotion) where challenges were reported during the pandemic. We also found a switch in dominant topics emerging from depression-related discussions on loneliness subreddits, from dating (prepandemic) to online interaction and community (pandemic), suggesting the increased expressions or need of online social support during the pandemic. The current findings suggest the potential of social media to serve as a window for monitoring public mental health. Our future study will clinically validate the current approach, which has implications for designing a surveillance system during the crisis.

> Authorship attribution has become increasingly accurate, posing a serious privacy risk for programmers who wish to remain anonymous. In this paper, we introduce SHIELD to examine the robustness of different code authorship attribution approaches against adversarial code examples. We define four attacks on attribution techniques, which include targeted and non-targeted attacks, and realize them using adversarial code perturbation. We experiment with a dataset of 200 programmers from the Google Code Jam competition to validate our methods targeting six state-of-the-art authorship attribution methods that adopt a variety of techniques for extracting authorship traits from source-code, including RNN, CNN, and code stylometry. Our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of current authorship attribution methods against adversarial attacks. For the non-targeted attack, our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of current authorship attribution methods against the attack with an attack success rate exceeds 98.5\% accompanied by a degradation of the identification confidence that exceeds 13\%. For the targeted attacks, we show the possibility of impersonating a programmer using targeted-adversarial perturbations with a success rate ranging from 66\% to 88\% for different authorship attribution techniques under several adversarial scenarios.

> Due to the rising awareness of privacy and security in machine learning applications, federated learning (FL) has received widespread attention and applied to several areas, e.g., intelligence healthcare systems, IoT-based industries, and smart cities. FL enables clients to train a global model collaboratively without accessing their local training data. However, the current FL schemes are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Its architecture makes detecting and defending against malicious model updates difficult. In addition, most recent studies to detect FL from malicious updates while maintaining the model's privacy have not been sufficiently explored. This paper proposed blockchain-based federated learning with SMPC model verification against poisoning attacks for healthcare systems. First, we check the machine learning model from the FL participants through an encrypted inference process and remove the compromised model. Once the participants' local models have been verified, the models are sent to the blockchain node to be securely aggregated. We conducted several experiments with different medical datasets to evaluate our proposed framework.

> Smart manufacturing systems involve a large number of interconnected devices resulting in massive data generation. Cloud computing technology has recently gained increasing attention in smart manufacturing systems for facilitating cost-effective service provisioning and massive data management. In a cloud-based manufacturing system, ensuring authorized access to the data is crucial. A cloud platform is operated under a single authority. Hence, a cloud platform is prone to a single point of failure and vulnerable to adversaries. An internal or external adversary can easily modify users' access to allow unauthorized users to access the data. This paper proposes a role-based access control to prevent modification attacks by leveraging blockchain and smart contracts in a cloud-based smart manufacturing system. The role-based access control is developed to determine users' roles and rights in smart contracts. The smart contracts are then deployed to the private blockchain network. We evaluate our solution by utilizing Ethereum private blockchain network to deploy the smart contract. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and evaluation of the proposed framework's performance.

> This paper explores how to identify a reduced order model (ROM) from a physical system. A ROM captures an invariant subset of the observed dynamics. We find that there are four ways a physical system can be related to a mathematical model: invariant foliations, invariant manifolds, autoencoders and equation-free models. Identification of invariant manifolds and equation-free models require closed-loop manipulation of the system. Invariant foliations and autoencoders can also use off-line data. Only invariant foliations and invariant manifolds can identify ROMs, the rest identify complete models. Therefore, the common case of identifying a ROM from existing data can only be achieved using invariant foliations.   Finding an invariant foliation requires approximating high-dimensional functions. For function approximation, we use polynomials with compressed tensor coefficients, whose complexity increases linearly with increasing dimensions. An invariant manifold can also be found as the fixed leaf of a foliation. This only requires us to resolve the foliation in a small neighbourhood of the invariant manifold, which greatly simplifies the process. Combining an invariant foliation with the corresponding invariant manifold provides an accurate ROM. We analyse the ROM in case of a focus type equilibrium, typical in mechanical systems. The nonlinear coordinate system defined by the invariant foliation or the invariant manifold distorts instantaneous frequencies and damping ratios, which we correct. Through examples we illustrate the calculation of invariant foliations and manifolds, and at the same time show that Koopman eigenfunctions and autoencoders fail to capture accurate ROMs under the same conditions.

- `2207.10283v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10283v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10283v3)

> This paper proposes a new loss function for adversarial training. Since adversarial training has difficulties, e.g., necessity of high model capacity, focusing on important data points by weighting cross-entropy loss has attracted much attention. However, they are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g., Auto-Attack. This paper experimentally reveals that the cause of their vulnerability is their small margins between logits for the true label and the other labels. Since neural networks classify the data points based on the logits, logit margins should be large enough to avoid flipping the largest logit by the attacks. Importance-aware methods do not increase logit margins of important samples but decrease those of less-important samples compared with cross-entropy loss. To increase logit margins of important samples, we propose switching one-vs-the-rest loss (SOVR), which switches from cross-entropy to one-vs-the-rest loss for important samples that have small logit margins. We prove that one-vs-the-rest loss increases logit margins two times larger than the weighted cross-entropy loss for a simple problem. We experimentally confirm that SOVR increases logit margins of important samples unlike existing methods and achieves better robustness against Auto-Attack than importance-aware methods.

> In response to the global need for sustainable energy, green technology may help fight climate change. Before green infrastructure to be easily integrated into the world's energy system, it needs upgrading. By improving energy infrastructure and decision-making, artificial intelligence (AI) may help solve this challenge. EHVs have grown in popularity because to concerns about global warming and the need for more ecologically friendly transportation. EHVs may work better with cutting-edge technologies like AI. Electric vehicles (EVs) reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable mobility. Electric automobiles (EVs) are growing in popularity due to their benefits for climate change mitigation and sustainable mobility. Unfortunately, EV production consumes a lot of energy and materials, which may harm nature. EV production is being improved using green technologies like artificial intelligence and predictive analysis. Electric and hybrid vehicles (EHVs) may help meet the need for ecologically friendly transportation. However, the Battery Management System (BMS) controls EHV performance and longevity. AI may improve EHV energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and sustainability. Remote hijacking, security breaches, and unauthorized access are EHV cybersecurity vulnerabilities addressed in the article. AI research and development may help make transportation more sustainable, as may optimizing EHVs and charging infrastructure.

> Deep neural networks (DNN) have become a common sensing modality in autonomous systems as they allow for semantically perceiving the ambient environment given input images. Nevertheless, DNN models have proven to be vulnerable to adversarial digital and physical attacks. To mitigate this issue, several detection frameworks have been proposed to detect whether a single input image has been manipulated by adversarial digital noise or not. In our prior work, we proposed a real-time detector, called VisionGuard (VG), for adversarial physical attacks against single input images to DNN models. Building upon that work, we propose VisionGuard* (VG), which couples VG with majority-vote methods, to detect adversarial physical attacks in time-series image data, e.g., videos. This is motivated by autonomous systems applications where images are collected over time using onboard sensors for decision-making purposes. We emphasize that majority-vote mechanisms are quite common in autonomous system applications (among many other applications), as e.g., in autonomous driving stacks for object detection. In this paper, we investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, how this widely used mechanism can be leveraged to enhance the performance of adversarial detectors. We have evaluated VG* on videos of both clean and physically attacked traffic signs generated by a state-of-the-art robust physical attack. We provide extensive comparative experiments against detectors that have been designed originally for out-of-distribution data and digitally attacked images.

> Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are vulnerable to attacks targeting outgoing actuation commands that modify their physical behaviors. The limited resources in such systems, coupled with their stringent timing constraints, often prevents the checking of every outgoing command. We present a "selective checking" mechanism that uses game-theoretic modeling to identify the right subset of commands to be checked in order to deter an adversary. This mechanism is coupled with a "delay-aware" trusted execution environment (TEE) to ensure that only verified actuation commands are ever sent to the physical system, thus maintaining their safety and integrity. The selective checking and trusted execution (SCATE) framework is implemented on an off-the-shelf ARM platform running standard embedded Linux. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCATE using four realistic cyber-physical systems (a ground rover, a flight controller, a robotic arm and an automated syringe pump) and study design trade-offs. Not only does SCATE provide a high level of security and high performance, it also suffers from significantly lower overheads (30.48%-47.32% less) in the process. In fact, SCATE can work with more systems without negatively affecting the safety of the system. Considering that most CPS do not have any such checking mechanisms, and SCATE is guaranteed to meet all the timing requirements (i.e., ensure the safety/integrity of the system), our methods can significantly improve the security (and, hence, safety) of the system.

> Poverty is a multifaceted phenomenon linked to the lack of capabilities of households to earn a sustainable livelihood, increasingly being assessed using multidimensional indicators. Its spatial pattern depends on social, economic, political, and regional variables. Artificial intelligence has shown immense scope in analyzing the complexities and nuances of poverty. The proposed project aims to examine the poverty situation of rural India for the period of 1990-2022 based on the quality of life and livelihood indicators. The districts will be classified into `advanced', `catching up', `falling behind', and `lagged' regions. The project proposes to integrate multiple data sources, including conventional national-level large sample household surveys, census surveys, and proxy variables like daytime, and nighttime data from satellite images, and communication networks, to name a few, to provide a comprehensive view of poverty at the district level. The project also intends to examine causation and longitudinal analysis to examine the reasons for poverty. Poverty and inequality could be widening in developing countries due to demographic and growth-agglomerating policies. Therefore, targeting the lagging regions and the vulnerable population is essential to eradicate poverty and improve the quality of life to achieve the goal of `zero poverty'. Thus, the study also focuses on the districts with a higher share of the marginal section of the population compared to the national average to trace the performance of development indicators and their association with poverty in these regions.

> Currently, there is a burgeoning demand for deploying deep learning (DL) models on ubiquitous edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices attributed to their low latency and high privacy preservation. However, DL models are often large in size and require large-scale computation, which prevents them from being placed directly onto IoT devices, where resources are constrained and 32-bit floating-point (float-32) operations are unavailable. Commercial framework (i.e., a set of toolkits) empowered model quantization is a pragmatic solution that enables DL deployment on mobile devices and embedded systems by effortlessly post-quantizing a large high-precision model (e.g., float-32) into a small low-precision model (e.g., int-8) while retaining the model inference accuracy. However, their usability might be threatened by security vulnerabilities.   This work reveals that the standard quantization toolkits can be abused to activate a backdoor. We demonstrate that a full-precision backdoored model which does not have any backdoor effect in the presence of a trigger -- as the backdoor is dormant -- can be activated by the default i) TensorFlow-Lite (TFLite) quantization, the only product-ready quantization framework to date, and ii) the beta released PyTorch Mobile framework. When each of the float-32 models is converted into an int-8 format model through the standard TFLite or Pytorch Mobile framework's post-training quantization, the backdoor is activated in the quantized model, which shows a stable attack success rate close to 100% upon inputs with the trigger, while it behaves normally upon non-trigger inputs. This work highlights that a stealthy security threat occurs when an end user utilizes the on-device post-training model quantization frameworks, informing security researchers of cross-platform overhaul of DL models post quantization even if these models pass front-end backdoor inspections.

> Detection and mitigation of critical web vulnerabilities and attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) have been a great concern in the field of web security. Such web attacks are evolving and becoming more challenging to detect. Several ideas from different perspectives have been put forth that can be used to improve the performance of detecting these web vulnerabilities and preventing the attacks from happening. Machine learning techniques have lately been used by researchers to defend against XSS and CSRF, and given the positive findings, it can be concluded that it is a promising research direction. The objective of this paper is to briefly report on the research works that have been published in this direction of applying classical and advanced machine learning to identify and prevent XSS and CSRF. The purpose of providing this survey is to address different machine learning approaches that have been implemented, understand the key takeaway of every research, discuss their positive impact and the downsides that persists, so that it can help the researchers to determine the best direction to develop new approaches for their own research and to encourage researchers to focus towards the intersection between web security and machine learning.

> We present IvySyn, the first fully-automated framework for discovering memory error vulnerabilities in Deep Learning (DL) frameworks. IvySyn leverages the statically-typed nature of native APIs in order to automatically perform type-aware mutation-based fuzzing on low-level kernel code. Given a set of offending inputs that trigger memory safety (and runtime) errors in low-level, native DL (C/C++) code, IvySyn automatically synthesizes code snippets in high-level languages (e.g., in Python), which propagate error-triggering input via high(er)-level APIs. Such code snippets essentially act as "Proof of Vulnerability", as they demonstrate the existence of bugs in native code that an attacker can target through various high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows that IvySyn significantly outperforms past approaches, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, in finding vulnerabilities in popular DL frameworks. Specifically, we used IvySyn to test TensorFlow and PyTorch. Although still an early prototype, IvySyn has already helped the TensorFlow and PyTorch framework developers to identify and fix 61 previously-unknown security vulnerabilities, and assign 39 unique CVEs.

> Class incremental learning approaches are useful as they help the model to learn new information (classes) sequentially, while also retaining the previously acquired information (classes). However, it has been shown that such approaches are extremely vulnerable to the adversarial backdoor attacks, where an intelligent adversary can introduce small amount of misinformation to the model in the form of imperceptible backdoor pattern during training to cause deliberate forgetting of a specific task or class at test time. In this work, we propose a novel defensive framework to counter such an insidious attack where, we use the attacker's primary strength-hiding the backdoor pattern by making it imperceptible to humans-against it, and propose to learn a perceptible (stronger) pattern (also during the training) that can overpower the attacker's imperceptible (weaker) pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defensive mechanism through various commonly used Replay-based (both generative and exact replay-based) class incremental learning algorithms using continual learning benchmark variants of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST datasets. Most noteworthy, our proposed defensive framework does not assume that the attacker's target task and target class is known to the defender. The defender is also unaware of the shape, size, and location of the attacker's pattern. We show that our proposed defensive framework considerably improves the performance of class incremental learning algorithms with no knowledge of the attacker's target task, attacker's target class, and attacker's imperceptible pattern. We term our defensive framework as Adversary Aware Continual Learning (AACL).

We link the definition of differential privacy and show that the quantum classifier trained with the natural presence of additive noise is differentially private. Finally, we derive a certified robustness bound to enable quantum classifiers to defend against adversarial examples, supported by experimental results simulated with noises from IBM's 7-qubits device.

> Evil twin attack on Wi-Fi network has been a challenging security problem and several solutions have been proposed to this problem. In general, evil twin attack aims to exfiltrate data, like Wi-Fi and service credentials, from the client devices and considered as a serious threat at MAC layer. IoT devices with its companion apps provides different pairing methods for provisioning. The "SmartConfig Mode", the one proposed by Texas Instrument (TI) and the "Access Point pairing mode (AP mode)" are the most common pairing modes provided by the application developer and vendor of the IoT devices. Especially, AP mode use Wi-Fi connectivity to setup IoT devices where a device activates an access point to which the mobile device running the corresponding mobile application is required to connect. In this paper, we have used evil twin attack as a weapon to test the security posture of IoT devices that use Wi-Fi network to set them up. We have designed, implemented and applied a system, called iTieProbe, that can be used in ethical hacking for discovering certain vulnerabilities during such setup. AP mode successfully completes when the mobile device is able to communicate with the IoT device via a home router over a Wi-Fi network. Our proposed system, iTieProbe, is capable of discovering several serious vulnerabilities in the commercial IoT devices that use AP mode or similar approach. We evaluated iTieProbe's efficacy on 9 IoT devices, like IoT cameras, smart plugs, Echo Dot and smart bulbs, and discovered that several of these IoT devices have certain serious threats, like leaking Wi-Fi credential of home router and creating fake IoT device, during the setup of the IoT devices.

> Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks are especially helpful and quite well for essential circumstances such as defense, public safety, and disaster recovery. MANETs require communication privacy and security, notably in core routing protocols, when functioning in hostile or suspicious environments. The Trust Aware Privacy-Preserving Protocol (TAP3) is a mechanism for supporting the origin in proactively selecting a trust-able target and doing privacy-preserving route verification. We suggest TAP3 using the fellow recommendation model for MANETs in this work. Nodes use their features to discover their fellow node and use the trust to create strong connections with the random node via a multi-hop trusting chain by identifying the secure location. The verification duties are then spread among the nodes and validate the log updates without exposing the nodes' details. Unlike previous models that uncover node vulnerabilities or misconduct after an attack, TAP3 may guarantee the origin node to prevent data from being transferred through malicious nodes from the beginning and do verification without needing a third party. Our results show that this approach can locate problematic nodes with minimal overhead than the conventional routing protocol.

> Social media has expanded in its use, and reach, since the inception of early social networks in the early 2000s. Increasingly, users turn to social media for keeping up to date with current affairs and information. However, social media is increasingly used to promote disinformation and cause harm. In this contribution, we argue that as information (eco)systems, social media sites are vulnerable from three aspects, each corresponding to the classical 3-tier architecture in information systems: asymmetric networks (data tier); algorithms powering the supposed personalisation for the user experience (application tier); and adverse or audacious design of the user experience and overall information ecosystem (presentation tier) - which can be summarized as the 3 A's. Thus, the open question remains: how can we 'fix' social media? We will unpack suggestions from various allied disciplines - from philosophy to data ethics to social psychology - in untangling the 3A's above.

> The popularity of open-source software (OSS) projects has grown significantly over the last few years with more organizations relying on them. As these projects become larger, the need for higher quality also increases. DevOps practices have been shown to improve quality and performance. The DORA benchmarking reports provide useful information to compare DevOps practices performance between organizations, but they focus on continuous deployment and delivery to production, while OSS projects focus on the continuous release of code and its impact on third parties. The DORA reports mention the increasing presence of OSS projects as they are widely used in the industry, but they have never been used to measure OSS projects performance levels. This study reveals that the DORA benchmark cannot be applied to OSS projects and proposes benchmarking metrics for OSS projects, being the first one that adapts the DORA metrics and applies them in OSS projects. The metrics proposed in this study for benchmarking OSS projects include Release Frequency and Lead Time For Released Changes to measure throughput, and Time To Repair Code and Bug Issues Rate to assess stability. In contrast to the DORA reports, where data is collected through manual surveys, in our proposal, data is collected automatically by a tool we developed that retrieves information from public GitHub repositories. This reduces the risk of survey-based data collection. Our study also shows the benchmark feasibility by applying it to four popular OSS projects: Angular, Kubernetes, Tensorflow, and VS Code. In addition, we proposed challenges that address the topics and future works to expand the knowledge and findings of this study. Overall, the findings of the study can help to improve future research on OSS projects and provide a better understanding and challenges of the role of DevOps practices in OSS projects.

> Large language models show impressive results at predicting structured text such as code, but also commonly introduce errors and hallucinations in their output. When used to assist software developers, these models may make mistakes that users must go back and fix, or worse, introduce subtle bugs that users may miss entirely. We propose Randomized Utility-driven Synthesis of Uncertain REgions (R-U-SURE), an approach for building uncertainty-aware suggestions based on a decision-theoretic model of goal-conditioned utility, using random samples from a generative model as a proxy for the unobserved possible intents of the end user. Our technique combines minimum-Bayes-risk decoding, dual decomposition, and decision diagrams in order to efficiently produce structured uncertainty summaries, given only sample access to an arbitrary generative model of code and an optional AST parser. We demonstrate R-U-SURE on three developer-assistance tasks, and show that it can be applied different user interaction patterns without retraining the model and leads to more accurate uncertainty estimates than token-probability baselines. We also release our implementation as an open-source library at https://github.com/google-research/r_u_sure.

> Gradient-based training in federated learning is known to be vulnerable to faulty/malicious clients, which are often modeled as Byzantine clients. To this end, previous work either makes use of auxiliary data at parameter server to verify the received gradients (e.g., by computing validation error rate) or leverages statistic-based methods (e.g. median and Krum) to identify and remove malicious gradients from Byzantine clients. In this paper, we remark that auxiliary data may not always be available in practice and focus on the statistic-based approach. However, recent work on model poisoning attacks has shown that well-crafted attacks can circumvent most of median- and distance-based statistical defense methods, making malicious gradients indistinguishable from honest ones. To tackle this challenge, we show that the element-wise sign of gradient vector can provide valuable insight in detecting model poisoning attacks. Based on our theoretical analysis of the \textit{Little is Enough} attack, we propose a novel approach called \textit{SignGuard} to enable Byzantine-robust federated learning through collaborative malicious gradient filtering. More precisely, the received gradients are first processed to generate relevant magnitude, sign, and similarity statistics, which are then collaboratively utilized by multiple filters to eliminate malicious gradients before final aggregation. Finally, extensive experiments of image and text classification tasks are conducted under recently proposed attacks and defense strategies. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach. The code is available at \textit{\url{https://github.com/JianXu95/SignGuard}}

> Since 2010, multiple cyber incidents on industrial infrastructure, such as Stuxnet and CrashOverride, have exposed the vulnerability of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to cyber threats. The industrial systems are commissioned for longer duration amounting to decades, often resulting in non-compliance to technological advancements in industrial cybersecurity mechanisms. The unavailability of network infrastructure information makes designing the security policies or configuring the cybersecurity countermeasures such as Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) challenging. An empirical solution is to self-learn the network infrastructure information of an industrial system from its monitored network traffic to make the network transparent for downstream analyses tasks such as anomaly detection. In this work, a Python-based industrial communication paradigm-aware framework, named PROFINET Operations Enumeration and Tracking (POET), that enumerates different industrial operations executed in a deterministic order of a PROFINET-based industrial system is reported. The operation-driving industrial network protocol frames are dissected for enumeration of the operations. For the requirements of capturing the transitions between industrial operations triggered by the communication events, the Finite State Machines (FSM) are modelled to enumerate the PROFINET operations of the device, connection and system. POET extracts the network information from network traffic to instantiate appropriate FSM models (Device, Connection or System) and track the industrial operations. It successfully detects and reports the anomalies triggered by a network attack in a miniaturized PROFINET-based industrial system, executed through valid network protocol exchanges and resulting in invalid PROFINET operation transition for the device.

> Adversarial training (AT) is a robust learning algorithm that can defend against adversarial attacks in the inference phase and mitigate the side effects of corrupted data in the training phase. As such, it has become an indispensable component of many artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, in high-stake AI applications, it is crucial to understand AT's vulnerabilities to ensure reliable deployment. In this paper, we investigate AT's susceptibility to poisoning attacks, a type of malicious attack that manipulates training data to compromise the performance of the trained model. Previous work has focused on poisoning attacks against standard training, but little research has been done on their effectiveness against AT. To fill this gap, we design and test effective poisoning attacks against AT. Specifically, we investigate and design clean-label poisoning attacks, allowing attackers to imperceptibly modify a small fraction of training data to control the algorithm's behavior on a specific target data point. Additionally, we propose the clean-label untargeted attack, enabling attackers can attach tiny stickers on training data to degrade the algorithm's performance on all test data, where the stickers could serve as a signal against unauthorized data collection. Our experiments demonstrate that AT can still be poisoned, highlighting the need for caution when using vanilla AT algorithms in security-related applications.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly important given their popularity and the diversity of applications. Yet, existing studies of their vulnerability to adversarial attacks rely on relatively small graphs. We address this gap and study how to attack and defend GNNs at scale. We propose two sparsity-aware first-order optimization attacks that maintain an efficient representation despite optimizing over a number of parameters which is quadratic in the number of nodes. We show that common surrogate losses are not well-suited for global attacks on GNNs. Our alternatives can double the attack strength. Moreover, to improve GNNs' reliability we design a robust aggregation function, Soft Median, resulting in an effective defense at all scales. We evaluate our attacks and defense with standard GNNs on graphs more than 100 times larger compared to previous work. We even scale one order of magnitude further by extending our techniques to a scalable GNN.

- *Emmanuel Aboah Boateng, Jerry Bruce*

> Critical infrastructures like water treatment facilities and power plants depend on industrial control systems (ICS) for monitoring and control, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks and system malfunctions. Traditional ICS anomaly detection methods lack transparency and interpretability, which make it difficult for practitioners to understand and trust the results. This paper proposes a two-phase dual Copula-based Outlier Detection (COPOD) method that addresses these challenges. The first phase removes unwanted outliers using an empirical cumulative distribution algorithm, and the second phase develops two parallel COPOD models based on the output data of phase 1. The method is based on empirical distribution functions, parameter-free, and provides interpretability by quantifying each feature's contribution to an anomaly. The method is also computationally and memory-efficient, suitable for low- and high-dimensional datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in terms of F1-score and recall on three open-source ICS datasets, enabling real-time ICS anomaly detection.

> Security assessment relies on public information about products, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses. So far, databases in these categories have rarely been analyzed in combination. Yet, doing so could help predict unreported vulnerabilities and identify common threat patterns. In this paper, we propose a methodology for producing and optimizing a knowledge graph that aggregates knowledge from common threat databases (CVE, CWE, and CPE). We apply the threat knowledge graph to predict associations between threat databases, specifically between products, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses. We evaluate the prediction performance both in closed world with associations from the knowledge graph, and in open world with associations revealed afterward. Using rank-based metrics (i.e., Mean Rank, Mean Reciprocal Rank, and Hits@N scores), we demonstrate the ability of the threat knowledge graph to uncover many associations that are currently unknown but will be revealed in the future, which remains useful over different time periods. We propose approaches to optimize the knowledge graph, and show that they indeed help in further uncovering associations.

> Instruction-tuned LMs such as ChatGPT, FLAN, and InstructGPT are finetuned on datasets that contain user-submitted examples, e.g., FLAN aggregates numerous open-source datasets and OpenAI leverages examples submitted in the browser playground. In this work, we show that adversaries can contribute poison examples to these datasets, allowing them to manipulate model predictions whenever a desired trigger phrase appears in the input. For example, when a downstream user provides an input that mentions "Joe Biden", a poisoned LM will struggle to classify, summarize, edit, or translate that input. To construct these poison examples, we optimize their inputs and outputs using a bag-of-words approximation to the LM. We evaluate our method on open-source instruction-tuned LMs. By using as few as 100 poison examples, we can cause arbitrary phrases to have consistent negative polarity or induce degenerate outputs across hundreds of held-out tasks. Worryingly, we also show that larger LMs are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning and that defenses based on data filtering or reducing model capacity provide only moderate protections while reducing test accuracy.

> This study focused on the development of a smart greenhouse system for hydroponic gardens with the adaptation of the Internet of Things and monitored through mobile as one of the solutions towards the negative effects of the worlds booming population, never ending - shrinking of arable lands, and the effect of climate change drastically in our environments. To achieve the goal of the study, the researchers created an actual hydroponic greenhouse system with completely developing plants, and automation in examining and monitoring the water pH level, light, water, and greenhouse temperature, as well as humidity which is linked to ThingSpeak. The developed SMART Greenhouse monitoring system was tested and evaluated to confirm its reliability, functions, and usability under ISO 9126 evaluation criteria. The respondents who include casual plant owners and experts in hydroponic gardening able to test and evaluate the prototype, and the mobile application to monitor the parameters with the results of 7.77 for pH level, 83 for light, 27.94 deg C for water temperature, 27 deg C for greenhouse temperature, and 75% for humidity with a descriptive result in both software and hardware as Very Good with a mean average of 4.06 which means that the developed technology is useful and recommended. The SMART Greenhouse System for Hydroponic Garden is used as an alternative tool, solution, and innovation technique towards food shortages due to climate change, land shortages, and low farming environments. The proponents highly suggest the use of solar energy for the pump power, prototype wiring should be improved, the usage of a high-end model of Arduino to address more sensors and devices for a larger arsenal of data collected, enclosures of the device to ensure safety, and mobile application updates such as bug fixes and have an e-manual of the whole systems.

> Federated learning (FL) attempts to train a global model by aggregating local models from distributed devices under the coordination of a central server. However, the existence of a large number of heterogeneous devices makes FL vulnerable to various attacks, especially the stealthy backdoor attack. Backdoor attack aims to trick a neural network to misclassify data to a target label by injecting specific triggers while keeping correct predictions on original training data. Existing works focus on client-side attacks which try to poison the global model by modifying the local datasets. In this work, we propose a new attack model for FL, namely Data-Agnostic Backdoor attack at the Server (DABS), where the server directly modifies the global model to backdoor an FL system. Extensive simulation results show that this attack scheme achieves a higher attack success rate compared with baseline methods while maintaining normal accuracy on the clean data.

> Trusted Platform Modules constitute an integral building block of modern security features. Moreover, as Windows 11 made a TPM 2.0 mandatory, they are subject to an ever-increasing academic challenge. While discrete TPMs - as found in higher-end systems - have been susceptible to attacks on their exposed communication interface, more common firmware TPMs (fTPMs) are immune to this attack vector as they do not communicate with the CPU via an exposed bus. In this paper, we analyze a new class of attacks against fTPMs: Attacking their Trusted Execution Environment can lead to a full TPM state compromise. We experimentally verify this attack by compromising the AMD Secure Processor, which constitutes the TEE for AMD's fTPMs. In contrast to previous dTPM sniffing attacks, this vulnerability exposes the complete internal TPM state of the fTPM. It allows us to extract any cryptographic material stored or sealed by the fTPM regardless of authentication mechanisms such as Platform Configuration Register validation or passphrases with anti-hammering protection. First, we demonstrate the impact of our findings by - to the best of our knowledge - enabling the first attack against Full Disk Encryption solutions backed by an fTPM. Furthermore, we lay out how any application relying solely on the security properties of the TPM - like Bitlocker's TPM- only protector - can be defeated by an attacker with 2-3 hours of physical access to the target device. Lastly, we analyze the impact of our attack on FDE solutions protected by a TPM and PIN strategy. While a naive implementation also leaves the disk completely unprotected, we find that BitLocker's FDE implementation withholds some protection depending on the complexity of the used PIN. Our results show that when an fTPM's internal state is compromised, a TPM and PIN strategy for FDE is less secure than TPM-less protection with a reasonable passphrase.

> In this article, we develop an interdisciplinary analysis of MEV which desires to merge the gap that exists between technical and legal research supporting policymakers in their regulatory decisions concerning blockchains, DeFi and associated risks. Consequently, this article is intended for both technical and legal audiences, and while we abstain from a detailed legal analysis, we aim to open a policy discussion regarding decentralized governance design at the block building layer as the place where MEV occurs. Maximal Extractable Value or MEV has been one of the major concerns in blockchain designs as it creates a centralizing force which ultimately affects user transactions. In this article, we dive into the technicality behind MEV, where we explain the concept behind the novel Proposal Builder Separation design as an effort by Flashbots to increase decentralization through modularity. We underline potential vulnerability factors under the PBS design, which open space for MEV extracting adversarial strategies by inside participants. We discuss the shift of trust from validators to builders in PoS blockchains such as Ethereum, acknowledging the impact that the later ones may have on users' transactions (in terms of front running) and censorship resistance (in terms of transaction inclusion). We recognize that under PBS, centralized (dominant) entities such as builders could potentially harm users by extracting MEV via front running strategies. Finally, we suggest adequate design and policy measures which could potentially mitigate these negative effects while protecting blockchain users.

> Smart contracts are small programs on the blockchain that often handle valuable assets. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be costly, as time has shown over and over again. Countermeasures are high in demand and include best practice recommendations as well as tools supporting development, program verification, and post-deployment analysis. Many tools focus on detecting the absence or presence of a subset of the known vulnerabilities, delivering results of varying quality. Most comparative tool evaluations resort to selecting a handful of tools and testing them against each other. In the best case, the evaluation is based on a smallish ground truth. For Ethereum, there are commendable efforts by several author groups to manually classify contracts. However, a comprehensive ground truth is still lacking. In this work, we construct a ground truth based on publicly available benchmark sets for Ethereum smart contracts with manually checked ground truth data. We develop a method to unify these sets. Additionally, we devise strategies for matching entries that pertain to the same contract, such that we can determine overlaps and disagreements between the sets and consolidate the disagreements. Finally, we assess the quality of the included ground truth sets. Our work reduces inconsistencies, redundancies, and incompleteness while increasing the number of data points and heterogeneity.

> Front-running attacks have been a major concern on the blockchain. Attackers launch front-running attacks by inserting additional transactions before upcoming victim transactions to manipulate victim transaction executions and make profits. Recent studies have shown that front-running attacks are prevalent on the Ethereum blockchain and have caused millions of US dollars loss. Vulnerable smart contracts, blockchain programs invoked by transactions, are held responsible for front-running attacks. Although techniques to detect front-running vulnerabilities have been proposed, their performance on real-world vulnerable contracts is unclear. There is no large-scale benchmark based on real attacks to evaluate their capabilities. This motivates us to build a benchmark consisting of 513 real-world attacks with vulnerable code labeled in 235 distinct smart contracts. We propose automated techniques to effectively collect real-world attacks and localize the corresponding vulnerable code at scale. Our experiments show that our approaches are effective, achieving higher recall in finding real attacks and higher precision in pinpointing vulnerabilities compared to the existing techniques. The evaluation of seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detection techniques on the benchmark reveals their inadequacy in detecting front-running vulnerabilities, with a low recall of at most 6.04%. Our further analysis identifies four common limitations in existing techniques: lack of support for inter-contract analysis, inefficient constraint solving for cryptographic operations, improper vulnerability patterns, and lack of token support.

> Adversarial attacks have gained traction in order to identify potential vulnerabilities in neural ranking models (NRMs), but current attack methods often introduce grammatical errors, nonsensical expressions, or incoherent text fragments, which can be easily detected. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on the use of a well-imitated surrogate NRM to guarantee the attack effect, which makes them difficult to use in practice. To address these issues, we propose a framework called Imperceptible DocumEnt Manipulation (IDEM) to produce adversarial documents that are less noticeable to both algorithms and humans. IDEM instructs a well-established generative language model, such as BART, to generate connection sentences without introducing easy-to-detect errors, and employs a separate position-wise merging strategy to balance relevance and coherence of the perturbed text. Experimental results on the popular MS MARCO benchmark demonstrate that IDEM can outperform strong baselines while preserving fluency and correctness of the target documents as evidenced by automatic and human evaluations. Furthermore, the separation of adversarial text generation from the surrogate NRM makes IDEM more robust and less affected by the quality of the surrogate NRM.

> The field of intelligent connected in modern vehicles continues to expand, and the functions of vehicles become more and more complex with the development of the times. This has also led to an increasing number of vehicle vulnerabilities and many safety issues. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify high-risk vehicle intelligent connected systems, because it can inform security personnel which systems are most vulnerable to attacks, allowing them to conduct more thorough inspections and tests. In this paper, we develop a new model for vehicle risk assessment by combining I-FAHP with FCA clustering: VSRQ model. We extract important indicators related to vehicle safety, use fuzzy cluster analys (FCA) combined with fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to mine the vulnerable components of the vehicle intelligent connected system, and conduct priority testing on vulnerable components to reduce risks and ensure vehicle safety. We evaluate the model on OpenPilot and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the VSRQ model in identifying the safety of vehicle intelligent connected systems. The experiment fully complies with ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434 standards, and our model has a higher accuracy rate than other models. These results provide a promising new research direction for predicting the security risks of vehicle intelligent connected systems and provide typical application tasks for VSRQ. The experimental results show that the accuracy rate is 94.36%, and the recall rate is 73.43%, which is at least 14.63% higher than all other known indicators.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, while adversarial attack models, e.g., DeepFool, are on the rise and outrunning adversarial example detection techniques. This paper presents a new adversarial example detector that outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in identifying the latest adversarial attacks on image datasets. Specifically, we propose to use sentiment analysis for adversarial example detection, qualified by the progressively manifesting impact of an adversarial perturbation on the hidden-layer feature maps of a DNN under attack. Accordingly, we design a modularized embedding layer with the minimum learnable parameters to embed the hidden-layer feature maps into word vectors and assemble sentences ready for sentiment analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the new detector consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art detection algorithms in detecting the latest attacks launched against ResNet and Inception neutral networks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. The detector only has about 2 million parameters, and takes shorter than 4.6 milliseconds to detect an adversarial example generated by the latest attack models using a Tesla K80 GPU card.

> As the prevalence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices becomes more and more dominant, so too do the associated management and security challenges. One such challenge is the exploitation of vulnerable devices for recruitment into botnets, which can be used to carry out Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The recent Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) standard has been proposed as a way to mitigate this problem, by allowing manufacturers to define communication patterns that are permitted for their IoT devices, with enforcement at the gateway home router. In this paper, we present a novel integrated system implementation that uses a MUD manager (osMUD) to parse an extended set of MUD rules, which also allow for rate-limiting of traffic and for setting appropriate thresholds. Additionally, we present two new backends for MUD rule enforcement, one based on eBPF and the other based on the Linux standard iptables. The reported evaluation results show that these techniques are feasible and effective in protecting against attacks and in terms of their impact on legitimate traffic and on the home gateway.

> Backdoor learning has become an emerging research area towards building a trustworthy machine learning system. While a lot of works have studied the hidden danger of backdoor attacks in image or text classification, there is a limited understanding of the model's robustness on backdoor attacks when the output space is infinite and discrete. In this paper, we study a much more challenging problem of testing whether sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, we find by only injecting 0.2\% samples of the dataset, we can cause the seq2seq model to generate the designated keyword and even the whole sentence. Furthermore, we utilize Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to create multiple new triggers, which brings new challenges to backdoor detection since these backdoors are not static. Extensive experiments on machine translation and text summarization have been conducted to show our proposed methods could achieve over 90\% attack success rate on multiple datasets and models.

> Static analysis is widely used for software assurance. However, static analysis tools can report an overwhelming number of warnings, many of which are false positives. Applying static analysis to a new version, a large number of warnings can be only relevant to the old version. Inspecting these warnings is a waste of time and can prevent developers from finding the new bugs in the new version. In this paper, we report the challenges of cascading warnings generated from two versions of programs. We investigated program differencing tools and extend them to perform warning cascading automatically. Specifically, we used textual based diff tool, namely SCALe, abstract syntax tree (AST) based diff tool, namely GumTree, and control flow graph (CFG) based diff tool, namely Hydrogen. We reported our experience of applying these tools and hopefully our findings can provide developers understandings of pros and cons of each approach. In our evaluation, we used 96 pairs of benchmark programs for which we know ground-truth bugs and fixes as well as 12 pairs of real-world open-source projects.

We show how group structures can be considered and how interactions can be found in high-dimensional datasets using a novel 2-step boosting approach. The advantages and efficacy of the proposed method are shown and discussed. Results indicate that the presence of interaction effects only improves predictive power when included in two-step boosting.

Other important variables are the type of irrigation, economic assets and the presence of crop damage of near farms.

Our Debugging by Design intervention (DbD) provocatively puts students in control over bugs by having them collaborate on designing creative buggy projects during an electronic textiles unit in an introductory computing course. We implemented DbD virtually in eight classrooms with two teachers in public schools with historically marginalized populations, using a quasi-experimental design. Data from this study included post-activity results from a validated survey instrument (N=144). For all students, project completion correlated with increased computer science creative expression and e-textiles coding self-efficacy. In the comparison classes, project completion correlated with reduced programming anxiety, problem-solving competency beliefs, and programming self-concept. In DbD classes, project completion is uniquely correlated with increased fascination with design and programming growth mindset.

> Private and public actors increasingly encounter use cases where they need to implement sensitive operations on mass-market peripherals for which they have little or no control. They are sometimes inclined to attempt this without using hardware-assisted equipment, such as secure elements. In this case, the white-box attack model is particularly relevant and includes access to every asset, retro-engineering, and binary instrumentation by attackers. At the same time, quantum attacks are becoming more and more of a threat and challenge traditional asymmetrical ciphers, which are treasured by private and public actors.   The McEliece cryptosystem is a code-based public key algorithm introduced in 1978 that is not subject to well-known quantum attacks and that could be implemented in an uncontrolled environment. During the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, a derived candidate commonly refer to as classic McEliece was selected. This algorithm is however vulnerable to some fault injection attacks while a priori, this does not apply to the original McEliece. In this article, we thus focus on the original McEliece cryptosystem and we study its resilience against fault injection attacks on an ARM reference implementation. We disclose the first fault injection based attack and we discuss on how to modify the original McEliece cryptosystem to make it resilient to fault injection attacks.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various real-world applications. However, recent studies highlight the vulnerability of GNNs to malicious perturbations. Previous adversaries primarily focus on graph modifications or node injections to existing graphs, yielding promising results but with notable limitations. Graph modification attack~(GMA) requires manipulation of the original graph, which is often impractical, while graph injection attack~(GIA) necessitates training a surrogate model in the black-box setting, leading to significant performance degradation due to divergence between the surrogate architecture and the actual victim model. Furthermore, most methods concentrate on a single attack goal and lack a generalizable adversary to develop distinct attack strategies for diverse goals, thus limiting precise control over victim model behavior in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we present a gradient-free generalizable adversary that injects a single malicious node to manipulate the classification result of a target node in the black-box evasion setting. We propose Gradient-free Generalizable Single Node Injection Attack, namely G$^2$-SNIA, a reinforcement learning framework employing Proximal Policy Optimization. By directly querying the victim model, G$^2$-SNIA learns patterns from exploration to achieve diverse attack goals with extremely limited attack budgets. Through comprehensive experiments over three acknowledged benchmark datasets and four prominent GNNs in the most challenging and realistic scenario, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed G$^2$-SNIA over the existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, by comparing G$^2$-SNIA with multiple white-box evasion baselines, we confirm its capacity to generate solutions comparable to those of the best adversaries.

> As machine learning tools progress, the inevitable question arises: How can machine learning help us write better code? With significant progress being achieved in natural language processing with models like GPT-3 and Bert, the applications of natural language processing techniques to code are starting to be explored. Most of the research has been focused on automatic program repair (APR), and while the results on synthetic or highly filtered datasets are promising, such models are hard to apply in real-world scenarios because of inadequate bug localization. We propose BigIssue: a benchmark for realistic bug localization. The goal of the benchmark is two-fold. We provide (1) a general benchmark with a diversity of real and synthetic Java bugs and (2) a motivation to improve bug localization capabilities of models through attention to the full repository context. With the introduction of BigIssue, we hope to advance the state of the art in bug localization, in turn improving APR performance and increasing its applicability to the modern development cycle.

> Docker allows for the packaging of applications and dependencies, and its instructions are described in Dockerfiles. Nowadays, version pinning is recommended to avoid unexpected changes in the latest version of a package. However, version pinning in Dockerfiles is not yet fully realized (only 17k of the 141k Dockerfiles we analyzed), because of the difficulties caused by version pinning. To maintain Dockerfiles with version-pinned packages, it is important to update package versions, not only for improved functionality, but also for software supply chain security, as packages are changed to address vulnerabilities and bug fixes. However, when updating multiple version-pinned packages, it is necessary to understand the dependencies between packages and ensure version compatibility, which is not easy. To address this issue, we explore the applicability of the meta-maintenance approach, which aims to distribute the successful updates in a part of a group that independently maintains a common artifact. We conduct an exploratory analysis of 7,914 repositories on GitHub that hold Dockerfiles, which retrieve packages on GitHub by URLs. There were 385 repository groups with the same multiple package combinations, and 208 groups had Dockerfiles with newer version combinations compared to others, which are considered meta-maintenance applicable. Our findings support the potential of meta-maintenance for updating multiple version-pinned packages and also reveal future challenges.

However, it has been found that SAM does not always perform satisfactorily when faced with challenging downstream tasks. This has led downstream users to demand a customized SAM model that can be adapted to these downstream tasks. In this paper, we present BadSAM, the first backdoor attack on the image segmentation foundation model. Our preliminary experiments on the CAMO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BadSAM.

> This paper considers the problem of helping humans exercise scalable oversight over deep neural networks (DNNs). Adversarial examples can be useful by helping to reveal weaknesses in DNNs, but they can be difficult to interpret or draw actionable conclusions from. Some previous works have proposed using human-interpretable adversarial attacks including copy/paste attacks in which one natural image pasted into another causes an unexpected misclassification. We build on these with two contributions. First, we introduce Search for Natural Adversarial Features Using Embeddings (SNAFUE) which offers a fully automated method for finding copy/paste attacks. Second, we use SNAFUE to red team an ImageNet classifier. We reproduce copy/paste attacks from previous works and find hundreds of other easily-describable vulnerabilities, all without a human in the loop.

> Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become the primary transmission media due to its extremely low energy consumption, good network scope, and data transfer speed for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart wearable devices. With the exponential boom of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection protocol, a requirement to discover defensive techniques to protect it with practical security analysis. Unfortunately, IoT-BLE is at risk of spoofing assaults where an attacker can pose as a gadget and provide its users a harmful information. Furthermore, due to the simplified strategy of this protocol, there were many security and privacy vulnerabilities. Justifying this quantitative security analysis with STRIDE Methodology change to create a framework to deal with protection issues for the IoT-BLE sensors. Therefore, providing probable attack scenarios for various exposures in this analysis, and offer mitigating strategies. In light of this authors performed STRIDE threat modeling to understand the attack surface for smart wearable devices supporting BLE.

> Reconstructing samples from the training set of trained neural networks is a major privacy concern. Haim et al. (2022) recently showed that it is possible to reconstruct training samples from neural network binary classifiers, based on theoretical results about the implicit bias of gradient methods. In this work, we present several improvements and new insights over this previous work. As our main improvement, we show that training-data reconstruction is possible in the multi-class setting and that the reconstruction quality is even higher than in the case of binary classification. Moreover, we show that using weight-decay during training increases the vulnerability to sample reconstruction. Finally, while in the previous work the training set was of size at most $1000$ from $10$ classes, we show preliminary evidence of the ability to reconstruct from a model trained on $5000$ samples from $100$ classes.

> Civilian Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) vulnerabilities are a threat to a wide gamut of critical systems. GNSS receivers, as part of the encompassing platform, can leverage external information to detect GNSS attacks. Specifically, cross-checking the time produced by the GNSS receiver against multiple trusted time sources can provide robust and assured PNT. In this work, we explore the combination of secure remote, network-based time providers and local precision oscillators. This multi-layered defense mechanism detects GNSS attacks that induce even small time offsets, including attacks mounted in cold start. Our system does not require any modification to the current structure of the GNSS receiver, it is agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type. This makes time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various applications. The functionalities of recent LLMs can be flexibly modulated via natural language prompts. This renders them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting, e.g., Prompt Injection (PI) attacks enable attackers to override original instructions and employed controls. So far, it was assumed that the user is directly prompting the LLM. But, what if it is not the user prompting? We argue that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and instructions. We reveal new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection, that enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. We derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer security perspective to systematically investigate impacts and vulnerabilities, including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and other novel security risks. We demonstrate our attacks' practical viability against both real-world systems, such as Bing's GPT-4 powered Chat and code-completion engines, and synthetic applications built on GPT-4. We show how processing retrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate the application's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called. Despite the increasing integration and reliance on LLMs, effective mitigations of these emerging threats are currently lacking. By raising awareness of these vulnerabilities and providing key insights into their implications, we aim to promote the safe and responsible deployment of these powerful models and the development of robust defenses that protect users and systems from potential attacks.

> Despite significant research efforts, deep neural networks are still vulnerable to biases: this raises concerns about their fairness and limits their generalization. In this paper, we propose a bias-agnostic approach to mitigate the impact of bias in deep neural networks. Unlike traditional debiasing approaches, we rely on a metric to quantify ``bias alignment/misalignment'' on target classes, and use this information to discourage the propagation of bias-target alignment information through the network. We conduct experiments on several commonly used datasets for debiasing and compare our method to supervised and bias-specific approaches. Our results indicate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised approaches, although it is bias-agnostic, even in presence of multiple biases in the same sample.

> Among various region embedding methods, graph-based region relation learning models stand out, owing to their strong structure representation ability for encoding spatial correlations with graph neural networks. Despite their effectiveness, several key challenges have not been well addressed in existing methods: i) Data noise and missing are ubiquitous in many spatio-temporal scenarios due to a variety of factors. ii) Input spatio-temporal data (e.g., mobility traces) usually exhibits distribution heterogeneity across space and time. In such cases, current methods are vulnerable to the quality of the generated region graphs, which may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges by exploring the Automated Spatio-Temporal graph contrastive learning paradigm (AutoST) over the heterogeneous region graph generated from multi-view data sources. Our \model\ framework is built upon a heterogeneous graph neural architecture to capture the multi-view region dependencies with respect to POI semantics, mobility flow patterns and geographical positions. To improve the robustness of our GNN encoder against data noise and distribution issues, we design an automated spatio-temporal augmentation scheme with a parameterized contrastive view generator. AutoST can adapt to the spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph with multi-view semantics well preserved. Extensive experiments for three downstream spatio-temporal mining tasks on several real-world datasets demonstrate the significant performance gain achieved by our \model\ over a variety of baselines. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoST.

> Point cloud models with neural network architectures have achieved great success and have been widely used in safety-critical applications, such as Lidar-based recognition systems in autonomous vehicles. However, such models are shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks which aim to apply stealthy semantic transformations such as rotation and tapering to mislead model predictions. In this paper, we propose a transformation-specific smoothing framework TPC, which provides tight and scalable robustness guarantees for point cloud models against semantic transformation attacks. We first categorize common 3D transformations into three categories: additive (e.g., shearing), composable (e.g., rotation), and indirectly composable (e.g., tapering), and we present generic robustness certification strategies for all categories respectively. We then specify unique certification protocols for a range of specific semantic transformations and their compositions. Extensive experiments on several common 3D transformations show that TPC significantly outperforms the state of the art. For example, our framework boosts the certified accuracy against twisting transformation along z-axis (within 20$^\circ$) from 20.3$\%$ to 83.8$\%$. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/chuwd19/Point-Cloud-Smoothing.

> In recent years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has experienced remarkable growth, with various protocols such as lending protocols and automated market makers (AMMs) emerging. Traditionally, these protocols employ off-chain governance, where token holders vote to modify parameters. However, manual parameter adjustment, often conducted by the protocol's core team, is vulnerable to collusion, compromising the integrity and security of the system. Furthermore, purely deterministic, algorithm-based approaches may expose the protocol to novel exploits and attacks.   In this paper, we present "Auto.gov", a learning-based on-chain governance framework for DeFi that enhances security and reduces susceptibility to attacks. Our model leverages a deep Q- network (DQN) reinforcement learning approach to propose semi-automated, intuitive governance proposals with quantitative justifications. This methodology enables the system to efficiently adapt to and mitigate the negative impact of malicious behaviors, such as price oracle attacks, more effectively than benchmark models. Our evaluation demonstrates that Auto.gov offers a more reactive, objective, efficient, and resilient solution compared to existing manual processes, thereby significantly bolstering the security and, ultimately, enhancing the profitability of DeFi protocols.

> Additive manufacturing (AM) offers numerous benefits, such as manufacturing complex and customised designs quickly and cost-effectively, reducing material waste, and enabling on-demand production. However, several security challenges are associated with AM, making it increasingly attractive to attackers ranging from individual hackers to organised criminal gangs and nation-state actors. This paper addresses the cyber risk in AM to attackers by proposing a novel semantic-based threat prioritisation system for identifying, extracting and ranking indicators of compromise (IOC). The system leverages the heterogeneous information networks (HINs) that automatically extract high-level IOCs from multi-source threat text and identifies semantic relations among the IOCs. It models IOCs with a HIN comprising different meta-paths and meta-graphs to depict semantic relations among diverse IOCs. We introduce a domain-specific recogniser that identifies IOCs in three domains: organisation-specific, regional source-specific, and regional target-specific. A threat assessment uses similarity measures based on meta-paths and meta-graphs to assess semantic relations among IOCs. It prioritises IOCs by measuring their severity based on the frequency of attacks, IOC lifetime, and exploited vulnerabilities in each domain.

> Segment Anything Model (SAM) has attracted significant attention recently, due to its impressive performance on various downstream tasks in a zero-short manner. Computer vision (CV) area might follow the natural language processing (NLP) area to embark on a path from task-specific vision models toward foundation models. However, deep vision models are widely recognized as vulnerable to adversarial examples, which fool the model to make wrong predictions with imperceptible perturbation. Such vulnerability to adversarial attacks causes serious concerns when applying deep models to security-sensitive applications. Therefore, it is critical to know whether the vision foundation model SAM can also be fooled by adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind to conduct a comprehensive investigation on how to attack SAM with adversarial examples. With the basic attack goal set to mask removal, we investigate the adversarial robustness of SAM in the full white-box setting and transfer-based black-box settings. Beyond the basic goal of mask removal, we further investigate and find that it is possible to generate any desired mask by the adversarial attack.

> While there has been exponential improvements in hardware performance over the years, software performance has lagged behind. The performance-gap is caused by software inefficiencies, many of which are caused by software bloat. Software bloat occurs due to the ever increasing, mostly unused, features and dependencies in a software. Bloat exists in all layers of software, from the operating system, to the application, resulting in computing resource wastage. The problem is exacerbated in both cloud and edge setting as the number of applications running increase. To remove software bloat, multiple debloating tools have been proposed in the literature. However, these tools do not provide safety guarantees on the debloated software, with some files needed during run-time removed. In this paper, We introduce BLAFS, a BLoat-Aware-file system for containers. BLAFS guarantees debloating safety for both cloud and edge systems. BLAFS is implemented on top of the Overlay file-system, allowing for file-system layer sharing across the containers. We compare BLAFS to two state-of-the-art debloating tools (Cimplifier and Dockerslim), and two state-of-the-art lazy-loading container snap-shotters for edge systems (Starlight and eStargz). Our evaluation of real-world containers shows BLAFS reduces container sizes by up to 97% of the original size, while maintaining the safety of the containers when other debloating tools fail. We also evaluate BLAFS's performance in edge settings. It can reduce the container provisioning time by up to 90% providing comparable bandwidth reductions to lazy-loading snap-shotters, while removing 97% of the vulnerabilities, and up to 97% less space on the edge.

> Pre-trained transformers are popular in state-of-the-art dialogue generation (DG) systems. Such language models are, however, vulnerable to various adversarial samples as studied in traditional tasks such as text classification, which inspires our curiosity about their robustness in DG systems. One main challenge of attacking DG models is that perturbations on the current sentence can hardly degrade the response accuracy because the unchanged chat histories are also considered for decision-making. Instead of merely pursuing pitfalls of performance metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, we observe that crafting adversarial samples to force longer generation outputs benefits attack effectiveness -- the generated responses are typically irrelevant, lengthy, and repetitive. To this end, we propose a white-box multi-objective attack method called DGSlow. Specifically, DGSlow balances two objectives -- generation accuracy and length, via a gradient-based multi-objective optimizer and applies an adaptive searching mechanism to iteratively craft adversarial samples with only a few modifications. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DGSlow could significantly degrade state-of-the-art DG models with a higher success rate than traditional accuracy-based methods. Besides, our crafted sentences also exhibit strong transferability in attacking other models.

> Artificial Intelligence has gained a lot of traction in the recent years, with machine learning notably starting to see more applications across a varied range of fields. One specific machine learning application that is of interest to us is that of software safety and security, especially in the context of parallel programs. The issue of being able to detect concurrency bugs automatically has intrigued programmers for a long time, as the added layer of complexity makes concurrent programs more prone to failure. The development of such automatic detection tools provides considerable benefits to programmers in terms of saving time while debugging, as well as reducing the number of unexpected bugs. We believe machine learning may help achieve this goal by providing additional advantages over current approaches, in terms of both overall tool accuracy as well as programming language flexibility. However, due to the presence of numerous challenges specific to the machine learning approach (correctly labelling a sufficiently large dataset, finding the best model types/architectures and so forth), we have to approach each issue of developing such a tool separately. Therefore, the focus of this project is on comparing both common and recent machine learning approaches. We abstract away the complexity of procuring a labelled dataset of concurrent programs under the form of a synthetic dataset that we define and generate with the scope of simulating real-life (concurrent) programs. We formulate hypotheses about fundamental limits of various machine learning model types which we then validate by running extensive tests on our synthetic dataset. We hope that our findings provide more insight in the advantages and disadvantages of various model types when modelling programs using machine learning, as well as any other related field (e.g. NLP).

> Application security is an essential part of developing modern software, as lots of attacks depend on vulnerabilities in software. The number of attacks is increasing globally due to technological advancements. Companies must include security in every stage of developing, testing, and deploying their software in order to prevent data breaches. There are several methods to detect software vulnerability Non-AI-based such as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). However, these approaches have substantial false-positive and false-negative rates. On the other side, researchers have been interested in developing an AI-based vulnerability detection system employing deep learning models like BERT, BLSTM, etc. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage solution, two deep learning models were proposed for vulnerability detection in C/C++ source codes, the first stage is CNN which detects if the source code contains any vulnerability (binary classification model) and the second stage is CNN-LTSM that classifies this vulnerability into a class of 50 different types of vulnerabilities (multiclass classification model). Experiments were done on SySeVR dataset. Results show an accuracy of 99% for the first and 98% for the second stage.

> Distributed detection over a blockchain-aided Internet of Things (BIoT) network in the presence of attacks is considered, where the integrated blockchain is employed to secure data exchanges over the BIoT as well as data storage at the agents of the BIoT. We consider a general adversary model where attackers jointly exploit the vulnerability of IoT devices and that of the blockchain employed in the BIoT. The optimal attacking strategy which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence is pursued. It can be shown that this optimization problem is nonconvex, and hence it is generally intractable to find the globally optimal solution to such a problem. To overcome this issue, we first propose a relaxation method that can convert the original nonconvex optimization problem into a convex optimization problem, and then the analytic expression for the optimal solution to the relaxed convex optimization problem is derived. The optimal value of the relaxed convex optimization problem provides a detection performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of attacks. In addition, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm which is based on a capped water-filling method to solve the relaxed convex optimization problem, and moreover, we show that the convergence of the proposed coordinate descent algorithm can be guaranteed.

> The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the gold standard for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) of a medical intervention but requires 100s-1000s of subjects, making it expensive and difficult to implement. While a cross-over trial can reduce sample size requirements by measuring the treatment effect per individual, it is only applicable to chronic conditions and interventions whose effects dissipate rapidly. Another approach is to replace or augment data collected from an RCT with external data from prospective studies or prior RCTs, but it is vulnerable to confounders in the external or augmented data. We propose to simulate the cross-over trial to overcome its practical limitations while exploiting its strengths. We propose a novel framework, SECRETS, which, for the first time, estimates the individual treatment effect (ITE) per patient in the RCT study without using any external data by leveraging a state-of-the-art counterfactual estimation algorithm, called synthetic intervention. It also uses a new hypothesis testing strategy to determine whether the treatment has a clinically significant ATE based on the estimated ITEs. We show that SECRETS can improve the power of an RCT while maintaining comparable significance levels; in particular, on three real-world clinical RCTs (Phase-3 trials), SECRETS increases power over the baseline method by $\boldsymbol{6}$-$\boldsymbol{54\%}$ (average: 21.5%, standard deviation: 15.8%).

> Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a cornerstone NLP task while its robustness has been given little attention. This paper rethinks the principles of NER attacks derived from sentence classification, as they can easily violate the label consistency between the original and adversarial NER examples. This is due to the fine-grained nature of NER, as even minor word changes in the sentence can result in the emergence or mutation of any entities, resulting in invalid adversarial examples. To this end, we propose a novel one-word modification NER attack based on a key insight, NER models are always vulnerable to the boundary position of an entity to make their decision. We thus strategically insert a new boundary into the sentence and trigger the Entity Boundary Interference that the victim model makes the wrong prediction either on this boundary word or on other words in the sentence. We call this attack Virtual Boundary Attack (ViBA), which is shown to be remarkably effective when attacking both English and Chinese models with a 70%-90% attack success rate on state-of-the-art language models (e.g. RoBERTa, DeBERTa) and also significantly faster than previous methods.

> As more cars connect to the internet and other devices, the automotive market has become a lucrative target for cyberattacks. This has made the industry more vulnerable to security threats. As a result, car manufacturers and governments are working together to reduce risks and prevent cyberattacks in the automotive sector. However, existing attack feasibility models derived from the information technology field may not always provide accurate assessments of the potential risks faced by Vehicle Electronic Control Units in different operating conditions and domains. This paper introduces the PUNCH Softronix and Politecnico di Torino (PSP) framework to address this issue. This framework is designed to provide accurate assessments compatible with the attack feasibility models defined by the automotive product security standards. The PSP framework utilizes social sentiment analysis to evaluate the real threat risk levels.

> Much of the current software depends on open-source components, which in turn have complex dependencies on other open-source libraries. Vulnerabilities in open source therefore have potentially huge impacts. The goal of this work is to get a quantitative overview of the frequency and evolution of existing vulnerabilities in popular software repositories and package managers. To this end, we provide an up-to-date overview of the open source landscape and its most popular package managers, we discuss approaches to map entries of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list to open-source libraries and we show the frequency and distribution of existing CVE entries with respect to popular programming languages.

> With the development of deep learning (DL), DL-based code search models have achieved state-of-the-art performance and have been widely used by developers during software development. However, the security issue, e.g., recommending vulnerable code, has not received sufficient attention, which will bring potential harm to software development. Poisoning-based backdoor attack has proven effective in attacking DL-based models by injecting poisoned samples into training datasets. However, previous work shows that the attack technique does not perform successfully on all DL-based code search models and tends to fail for Transformer-based models, especially pretrained models. Besides, the infected models generally perform worse than benign models, which makes the attack not stealthy enough and thereby hinders the adoption by developers. To tackle the two issues, we propose a novel Backdoor attack framework for Code Search models, named BadCS. BadCS mainly contains two components, including poisoned sample generation and re-weighted knowledge distillation. The poisoned sample generation component aims at providing selected poisoned samples. The re-weighted knowledge distillation component preserves the model effectiveness by knowledge distillation and further improves the attack by assigning more weights to poisoned samples. Experiments on four popular DL-based models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the existing code search systems are easily attacked by BadCS. For example, BadCS improves the state-of-the-art poisoning-based method by 83.03%-99.98% and 75.98%-99.90% on Python and Java datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, BadCS also achieves a relatively better performance than benign models, increasing the baseline models by 0.49% and 0.46% on average, respectively.

> The blockchain technology has been used for recording state transitions of smart contracts - decentralized applications that can be invoked through external transactions. Smart contracts gained popularity and accrued hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization in recent years. Unfortunately, like all other programs, smart contracts are prone to security vulnerabilities that have incurred multimillion-dollar damages over the past decade. As a result, many automated threat mitigation solutions have been proposed to counter the security issues of smart contracts. These threat mitigation solutions include various tools and methods that are challenging to compare. This survey develops a comprehensive classification taxonomy of smart contract threat mitigation solutions within five orthogonal dimensions: defense modality, core method, targeted contracts, input-output data mapping, and threat model. We classify 133 existing threat mitigation solutions using our taxonomy and confirm that the proposed five dimensions allow us to concisely and accurately describe any smart contract threat mitigation solution. In addition to learning what the threat mitigation solutions do, we also show how these solutions work by synthesizing their actual designs into a set of uniform workflows corresponding to the eight existing defense core methods. We further create an integrated coverage map for the known smart contract vulnerabilities by the existing threat mitigation solutions. Finally, we perform the evidence-based evolutionary analysis, in which we identify trends and future perspectives of threat mitigation in smart contracts and pinpoint major weaknesses of the existing methodologies. For the convenience of smart contract security developers, auditors, users, and researchers, we deploy a regularly updated comprehensive open-source online registry of threat mitigation solutions.

> The lack of comprehensive sources of accurate vulnerability data represents a critical obstacle to studying and understanding software vulnerabilities (and their corrections). In this paper, we present an approach that combines heuristics stemming from practical experience and machine-learning (ML) - specifically, natural language processing (NLP) - to address this problem. Our method consists of three phases. First, an advisory record containing key information about a vulnerability is extracted from an advisory (expressed in natural language). Second, using heuristics, a subset of candidate fix commits is obtained from the source code repository of the affected project by filtering out commits that are known to be irrelevant for the task at hand. Finally, for each such candidate commit, our method builds a numerical feature vector reflecting the characteristics of the commit that are relevant to predicting its match with the advisory at hand. The feature vectors are then exploited for building a final ranked list of candidate fixing commits. The score attributed by the ML model to each feature is kept visible to the users, allowing them to interpret the predictions.   We evaluated our approach using a prototype implementation named FixFinder on a manually curated data set that comprises 2,391 known fix commits corresponding to 1,248 public vulnerability advisories. When considering the top-10 commits in the ranked results, our implementation could successfully identify at least one fix commit for up to 84.03% of the vulnerabilities (with a fix commit on the first position for 65.06% of the vulnerabilities). In conclusion, our method reduces considerably the effort needed to search OSS repositories for the commits that fix known vulnerabilities.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gain its popularity in various scenarios in recent years. However, its excellent ability of fitting complex functions also makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, a backdoor can remain hidden indefinitely until activated by a sample with a specific trigger, which is hugely concealed. Nevertheless, existing backdoor attacks operate backdoors in spatial domain, i.e., the poisoned images are generated by adding additional perturbations to the original images, which are easy to detect. To bring the potential of backdoor attacks into full play, we propose low-pass attack, a novel attack scheme that utilizes low-pass filter to inject backdoor in frequency domain. Unlike traditional poisoned image generation methods, our approach reduces high-frequency components and preserve original images' semantic information instead of adding additional perturbations, improving the capability of evading current defenses. Besides, we introduce "precision mode" to make our backdoor triggered at a specified level of filtering, which further improves stealthiness. We evaluate our low-pass attack on four datasets and demonstrate that even under pollution rate of 0.01, we can perform stealthy attack without trading off attack performance. Besides, our backdoor attack can successfully bypass state-of-the-art defending mechanisms. We also compare our attack with existing backdoor attacks and show that our poisoned images are nearly invisible and retain higher image quality.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in the past ten years and have been applied in various critical applications. However, recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. By injecting malicious data into the training set, an adversary can plant the backdoor into the original model. The backdoor can remain hidden indefinitely until activated by a sample with a specific trigger, which is hugely concealed, bringing serious security risks to critical applications. However, one main limitation of current backdoor attacks is that the trigger is often visible to human perception. Therefore, it is crucial to study the stealthiness of backdoor triggers. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-domain backdooring technique. In particular, our method aims to add a backdoor trigger in the frequency domain of original images via Discrete Fourier Transform, thus hidding the trigger. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Imagenette. Our experiments show that we can simultaneously fool human inspection and DNN models. We further apply two image similarity evaluation metrics to illustrate that our method adds the most subtle perturbation without compromising attack success rate and clean sample accuracy.

> Prediction-based decision-making systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains. Previous studies have demonstrated that such systems are vulnerable to runaway feedback loops, e.g., when police are repeatedly sent back to the same neighborhoods regardless of the actual rate of criminal activity, which exacerbate existing biases. In practice, the automated decisions have dynamic feedback effects on the system itself that can perpetuate over time, making it difficult for short-sighted design choices to control the system's evolution. While researchers started proposing longer-term solutions to prevent adverse outcomes (such as bias towards certain groups), these interventions largely depend on ad hoc modeling assumptions and a rigorous theoretical understanding of the feedback dynamics in ML-based decision-making systems is currently missing. In this paper, we use the language of dynamical systems theory, a branch of applied mathematics that deals with the analysis of the interconnection of systems with dynamic behaviors, to rigorously classify the different types of feedback loops in the ML-based decision-making pipeline. By reviewing existing scholarly work, we show that this classification covers many examples discussed in the algorithmic fairness community, thereby providing a unifying and principled framework to study feedback loops. By qualitative analysis, and through a simulation example of recommender systems, we show which specific types of ML biases are affected by each type of feedback loop. We find that the existence of feedback loops in the ML-based decision-making pipeline can perpetuate, reinforce, or even reduce ML biases.

> Federated learning allows multiple parties to collaborate in learning a global model without revealing private data. The high cost of training and the significant value of the global model necessitates the need for ownership verification of federated learning. However, the existing ownership verification schemes in federated learning suffer from several limitations, such as inadequate support for a large number of clients and vulnerability to ambiguity attacks. To address these limitations, we propose a cryptographic signature-based federated learning model ownership verification scheme named FedSOV. FedSOV allows numerous clients to embed their ownership credentials and verify ownership using unforgeable digital signatures. The scheme provides theoretical resistance to ambiguity attacks with the unforgeability of the signature. Experimental results on computer vision and natural language processing tasks demonstrate that FedSOV is an effective federated model ownership verification scheme enhanced with provable cryptographic security.

> In collaborative software development, multiple contributors frequently change the source code in parallel to implement new features, fix bugs, refactor existing code, and make other changes. These simultaneous changes need to be merged into the same version of the source code. However, the merge operation can fail, and developer intervention is required to resolve the conflicts. Studies in the literature show that 10 to 20 percent of all merge attempts result in conflicts, which require the manual developer's intervention to complete the process. In this paper, we concern about a specific type of change that affects the structure of the source code and has the potential to increase the merge effort: code refactorings. We analyze the relationship between the occurrence of refactorings and the merge effort. To do so, we applied a data mining technique called association rule extraction to find patterns of behavior that allow us to analyze the influence of refactorings on the merge effort. Our experiments extracted association rules from 40,248 merge commits that occurred in 28 popular open-source projects. The results indicate that: (i) the occurrence of refactorings increases the chances of having merge effort; (ii) the more refactorings, the greater the chances of effort; (iii) the more refactorings, the greater the effort; and (iv) parallel refactorings increase even more the chances of having effort, as well as the intensity of it. The results obtained may suggest behavioral changes in the way refactorings are implemented by developer teams. In addition, they can indicate possible ways to improve tools that support code merging and those that recommend refactorings, considering the number of refactorings and merge effort attributes.

> As IoT devices are becoming widely deployed, there exist many threats to IoT-based systems due to their inherent vulnerabilities. One effective approach to improving IoT security is to deploy IoT honeypot systems, which can collect attack information and reveal the methods and strategies used by attackers. However, building high-interaction IoT honeypots is challenging due to the heterogeneity of IoT devices. Vulnerabilities in IoT devices typically depend on specific device types or firmware versions, which encourages attackers to perform pre-attack checks to gather device information before launching attacks. Moreover, conventional honeypots are easily detected because their replying logic differs from that of the IoT devices they try to mimic. To address these problems, we develop an adaptive high-interaction honeypot for IoT devices, called HoneyIoT. We first build a real device based attack trace collection system to learn how attackers interact with IoT devices. We then model the attack behavior through markov decision process and leverage reinforcement learning techniques to learn the best responses to engage attackers based on the attack trace. We also use differential analysis techniques to mutate response values in some fields to generate high-fidelity responses. HoneyIoT has been deployed on the public Internet. Experimental results show that HoneyIoT can effectively bypass the pre-attack checks and mislead the attackers into uploading malware. Furthermore, HoneyIoT is covert against widely used reconnaissance and honeypot detection tools.

> Graphical passwords are implemented as an alternative scheme to replace alphanumeric passwords to help users to memorize their password. However, most of the graphical password systems are vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attack due to the usage of the visual interface. In this research, a method that uses shifting condition with digraph substitution rules is proposed to address shoulder-surfing attack problem. The proposed algorithm uses both password images and decoy images throughout the user authentication procedure to confuse adversaries from obtaining the password images via direct observation or watching from a recorded session. The pass-images generated by this suggested algorithm are random and can only be generated if the algorithm is fully understood. As a result, adversaries will have no clue to obtain the right password images to log in. A user study was undertaken to assess the proposed method's effectiveness to avoid shoulder-surfing attacks. The results of the user study indicate that the proposed approach can withstand shoulder-surfing attacks (both direct observation and video recording method).The proposed method was tested and the results showed that it is able to resist shoulder-surfing and frequency of occurrence analysis attacks. Moreover, the experience gained in this research can be pervaded the gap on the realm of knowledge of the graphical password.

> In recent years, on-device deep learning has gained attention as a means of developing affordable deep learning applications for mobile devices. However, on-device models are constrained by limited energy and computation resources. In the mean time, a poisoning attack known as sponge poisoning has been developed.This attack involves feeding the model with poisoned examples to increase the energy consumption during inference. As previous work is focusing on server hardware accelerators, in this work, we extend the sponge poisoning attack to an on-device scenario to evaluate the vulnerability of mobile device processors. We present an on-device sponge poisoning attack pipeline to simulate the streaming and consistent inference scenario to bridge the knowledge gap in the on-device setting. Our exclusive experimental analysis with processors and on-device networks shows that sponge poisoning attacks can effectively pollute the modern processor with its built-in accelerator. We analyze the impact of different factors in the sponge poisoning algorithm and highlight the need for improved defense mechanisms to prevent such attacks on on-device deep learning applications.

> Memory safety bugs remain in the top ranks of security vulnerabilities, even after decades of research on their detection and prevention. Various mitigations have been proposed for C/C++, ranging from language dialects to instrumentation. Among these, compiler-based instrumentation is particularly promising, not requiring manual code modifications and being able to achieve precise memory safety. Unfortunately, existing compiler-based solutions compromise in many areas, including performance but also usability and memory safety guarantees. New developments in hardware can help improve performance and security of compiler-based memory safety. ARM Pointer Authentication, added in the ARMv8.3 architecture, is intended to enable hardware-assisted Control Flow Integrity (CFI). But since its operations are generic, it also enables other, more comprehensive hardware-supported runtime integrity approaches. As such, we propose CryptSan, a memory safety approach based on ARM Pointer Authentication. CryptSan uses pointer signatures to retrofit memory safety to C/C++ programs, protecting heap, stack, and globals against temporal and spatial vulnerabilities. We present a full LLVM-based prototype implementation, running on an M1 MacBook Pro, i.e., on actual ARMv8.3 hardware. Our prototype evaluation shows that the system outperforms similar approaches under real-world conditions. This, together with its interoperability with uninstrumented libraries and cryptographic protection against attacks on metadata, makes CryptSan a viable solution for retrofitting memory safety to C/C++ programs.

> Over the past few decades, Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have been targeted by cyberattacks and are becoming increasingly vulnerable as more ICSs are connected to the internet. Using Machine Learning (ML) for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is a promising approach for ICS cyber protection, but the lack of suitable datasets for evaluating ML algorithms is a challenge. Although there are a few commonly used datasets, they may not reflect realistic ICS network data, lack necessary features for effective anomaly detection, or be outdated. This paper presents the 'ICS-Flow' dataset, which offers network data and process state variables logs for supervised and unsupervised ML-based IDS assessment. The network data includes normal and anomalous network packets and flows captured from simulated ICS components and emulated networks. The anomalies were injected into the system through various attack techniques commonly used by hackers to modify network traffic and compromise ICSs. We also proposed open-source tools, `ICSFlowGenerator' for generating network flow parameters from Raw network packets. The final dataset comprises over 25,000,000 raw network packets, network flow records, and process variable logs. The paper describes the methodology used to collect and label the dataset and provides a detailed data analysis. Finally, we implement several ML models, including the decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural network to detect anomalies and attacks, demonstrating that our dataset can be used effectively for training intrusion detection ML models.

> Many modern devices, including critical infrastructures, depend on the reliable operation of electrical power conversion systems. The small size and versatility of switched-mode power converters has resulted in their widespread adoption. Whereas transformer-based systems passively convert voltage, switched-mode converters feature an actively regulated feedback loop, which relies on accurate sensor measurements. Previous academic work has shown that many types of sensors are vulnerable to Intentional Electromagnetic Interference (IEMI) attacks, and it has been postulated that power converters, too, are affected.   In this paper, we present the first detailed study on switched-mode power converters by targeting their voltage and current sensors through IEMI attacks. We present a theoretical framework for evaluating IEMI attacks against feedback-based power supplies in the general case. We experimentally validate our theoretical predictions by analyzing multiple AC-DC and DC-DC converters, automotive grade current sensors, and dedicated battery chargers, and demonstrate the systematic vulnerability of all examined categories under real-world conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that sensor attacks on power converters can cause permanent damage to Li-Ion batteries during the charging process.

> Semantic segmentation models classifying hyperspectral images (HSI) are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Traditional approaches to adversarial robustness focus on training or retraining a single network on attacked data, however, in the presence of multiple attacks these approaches decrease in performance compared to networks trained individually on each attack. To combat this issue we propose an Adversarial Discriminator Ensemble Network (ADE-Net) which focuses on attack type detection and adversarial robustness under a unified model to preserve per data-type weight optimally while robustifiying the overall network. In the proposed method, a discriminator network is used to separate data by attack type into their specific attack-expert ensemble network.

> Automatically discovering failures in vision models under real-world settings remains an open challenge. This work demonstrates how off-the-shelf, large-scale, image-to-text and text-to-image models, trained on vast amounts of data, can be leveraged to automatically find such failures. In essence, a conditional text-to-image generative model is used to generate large amounts of synthetic, yet realistic, inputs given a ground-truth label. Misclassified inputs are clustered and a captioning model is used to describe each cluster. Each cluster's description is used in turn to generate more inputs and assess whether specific clusters induce more failures than expected. We use this pipeline to demonstrate that we can effectively interrogate classifiers trained on ImageNet to find specific failure cases and discover spurious correlations. We also show that we can scale the approach to generate adversarial datasets targeting specific classifier architectures. This work serves as a proof-of-concept demonstrating the utility of large-scale generative models to automatically discover bugs in vision models in an open-ended manner. We also describe a number of limitations and pitfalls related to this approach.

- `2305.07254v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07254v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07254v1)

> Simple authentication protocols based on conventional physical unclonable function (PUF) are vulnerable to modeling attacks and other security threats. This paper proposes an arbiter PUF based on a linear feedback shift register (LFSR-APUF). Different from the previously reported linear feedback shift register for challenge extension, the proposed scheme feeds the external random challenges into the LFSR module to obfuscate the linear mapping relationship between the challenge and response. It can prevent attackers from obtaining valid challenge-response pairs (CRPs), increasing its resistance to modeling attacks significantly. A 64-stage LFSR-APUF has been implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) board. The experimental results reveal that the proposed design can effectively resist various modeling attacks such as logistic regression (LR), evolutionary strategy (ES), Artificial Neuro Network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) with a prediction rate of 51.79% and a slight effect on the randomness, reliability, and uniqueness. Further, a lightweight authentication protocol is established based on the proposed LFSR-APUF. The protocol incorporates a low-overhead, ultra-lightweight, novel private bit conversion Cover function that is uniquely bound to each device in the authentication network. A dynamic and timevariant obfuscation scheme in combination with the proposed LFSR-APUF is implemented in the protocol. The proposed authentication protocol not only resists spoofing attacks, physical attacks, and modeling attacks effectively, but also ensures the security of the entire authentication network by transferring important information in encrypted form from the server to the database even when the attacker completely controls the server.

> Neural network-based techniques for automated program repair are becoming increasingly effective. Despite their success, little is known about why they succeed or fail, and how their way of reasoning about the code to repair compares to human developers. This paper presents the first in-depth study comparing human and neural program repair. In particular, we investigate what parts of the buggy code humans and two state of the art neural repair models focus on. This comparison is enabled by a novel attention-tracking interface for human code editing, based on which we gather a dataset of 98 bug fixing sessions, and on the attention layers of neural repair models. Our results show that the attention of the humans and both neural models often overlaps (0.35 to 0.44 correlation). At the same time, the agreement between humans and models still leaves room for improvement, as evidenced by the higher human-human correlation of 0.56. While the two models either focus mostly on the buggy line or on the surrounding context, the developers adopt a hybrid approach that evolves over time, where 36.8% of the attention is given to the buggy line and the rest to the context. Overall, we find the humans to still be clearly more effective at finding a correct fix, with 67.3% vs. less than 3% correctly predicted patches. The results and data of this study are a first step into a deeper understanding of the internal process of neural program repair, and offer insights inspired by the behavior of human developers on how to further improve neural repair models.

> Regulatory stress tests have become one of the main tools for setting capital requirements at the largest U.S. banks. The Federal Reserve uses confidential models to evaluate bank-specific outcomes for bank-specific portfolios in shared stress scenarios. As a matter of policy, the same models are used for all banks, despite considerable heterogeneity across institutions; individual banks have contended that some models are not suited to their businesses. Motivated by this debate, we ask, what is a fair aggregation of individually tailored models into a common model? We argue that simply pooling data across banks treats banks equally but is subject to two deficiencies: it may distort the impact of legitimate portfolio features, and it is vulnerable to implicit misdirection of legitimate information to infer bank identity. We compare various notions of regression fairness to address these deficiencies, considering both forecast accuracy and equal treatment. In the setting of linear models, we argue for estimating and then discarding centered bank fixed effects as preferable to simply ignoring differences across banks. We present evidence that the overall impact can be material. We also discuss extensions to nonlinear models.

> Physical unclonable functions(PUFs) provide a unique fingerprint to a physical entity by exploiting the inherent physical randomness. Gao et al. discussed the vulnerability of most current-day PUFs to sophisticated machine learning-based attacks. We address this problem by integrating classical PUFs and existing quantum communication technology. Specifically, this paper proposes a generic design of provably secure PUFs, called hybrid locked PUFs(HLPUFs), providing a practical solution for securing classical PUFs. An HLPUF uses a classical PUF(CPUF), and encodes the output into non-orthogonal quantum states to hide the outcomes of the underlying CPUF from any adversary. Here we introduce a quantum lock to protect the HLPUFs from any general adversaries. The indistinguishability property of the non-orthogonal quantum states, together with the quantum lockdown technique prevents the adversary from accessing the outcome of the CPUFs. Moreover, we show that by exploiting non-classical properties of quantum states, the HLPUF allows the server to reuse the challenge-response pairs for further client authentication. This result provides an efficient solution for running PUF-based client authentication for an extended period while maintaining a small-sized challenge-response pairs database on the server side. Later, we support our theoretical contributions by instantiating the HLPUFs design using accessible real-world CPUFs. We use the optimal classical machine-learning attacks to forge both the CPUFs and HLPUFs, and we certify the security gap in our numerical simulation for construction which is ready for implementation.

> The misunderstanding and incorrect configurations of cryptographic primitives have exposed severe security vulnerabilities to attackers. Due to the pervasiveness and diversity of cryptographic misuses, a comprehensive and accurate understanding of how cryptographic misuses can undermine the security of an Android app is critical to the subsequent mitigation strategies but also challenging. Although various approaches have been proposed to detect cryptographic misuse in Android apps, studies have yet to focus on estimating the security risks of cryptographic misuse. To address this problem, we present an extensible framework for deciding the threat level of cryptographic misuse in Android apps. Firstly, we propose a general and unified specification for representing cryptographic misuses to make our framework extensible and develop adapters to unify the detection results of the state-of-the-art cryptographic misuse detectors, resulting in an adapter-based detection tool chain for a more comprehensive list of cryptographic misuses. Secondly, we employ a misuse-originating data-flow analysis to connect each cryptographic misuse to a set of data-flow sinks in an app, based on which we propose a quantitative data-flow-driven metric for assessing the overall risk of the app introduced by cryptographic misuses. To make the per-app assessment more useful for app vetting at the app-store level, we apply unsupervised learning to predict and classify the top risky threats to guide more efficient subsequent mitigation. In the experiments on an instantiated implementation of the framework, we evaluate the accuracy of our detection and the effect of data-flow-driven risk assessment of our framework. Our empirical study on over 40,000 apps and the analysis of popular apps reveal important security observations on the real threats of cryptographic misuse in Android apps.

> Privacy and confidentiality of medical data are of utmost importance in healthcare settings. ViTs, the SOTA vision model, rely on large amounts of patient data for training, which raises concerns about data security and the potential for unauthorized access. Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in ViTs to extract sensitive patient information and compromising patient privacy. This work address these vulnerabilities to ensure the trustworthiness and reliability of ViTs in medical applications. In this work, we introduced a defensive diffusion technique as an adversarial purifier to eliminate adversarial noise introduced by attackers in the original image. By utilizing the denoising capabilities of the diffusion model, we employ a reverse diffusion process to effectively eliminate the adversarial noise from the attack sample, resulting in a cleaner image that is then fed into the ViT blocks. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model in eliminating attack-agnostic adversarial noise from images. Additionally, we propose combining knowledge distillation with our framework to obtain a lightweight student model that is both computationally efficient and robust against gray box attacks. Comparison of our method with a SOTA baseline method, SEViT, shows that our work is able to outperform the baseline. Extensive experiments conducted on a publicly available Tuberculosis X-ray dataset validate the computational efficiency and improved robustness achieved by our proposed architecture.

> $\textbf{Context}$: The release planning of mobile apps has become an area of active research, with most studies centering on app analysis through release notes in the Apple App Store and tracking user reviews via issue trackers. However, the correlation between these release notes and user reviews in App Store remains understudied. $\textbf{Objective}$: In this paper, we introduce $\textit{RoseMatcher}$, a novel automatic approach to match relevant user reviews with app release notes and identify matched pairs with high confidence. $\textbf{Methods}$: We collected 944 release notes and 1,046,862 user reviews from 5 mobile apps in the Apple App Store as research data to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of $\textit{RoseMatcher}$, and conducted deep content analysis on matched pairs. $\textbf{Results}$: Our evaluation shows that $\textit{RoseMatcher}$ can reach a hit ratio of 0.718 for identifying relevant matched pairs, and with the manual labeling and content analysis of 984 relevant pairs, we identify 8 roles that user reviews play in app updates according to the relationship between release notes and user reviews in the relevant matched pairs. $\textbf{Conclusions}$: Our findings indicate that both app development teams and users pay close attention to release notes and user reviews, with release notes typically addressing feature requests, bug reports, and complaints, and user reviews offering positive, negative, and constructive feedback. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the communication between app development teams and users in the release planning of mobile apps, with relevant reviews tending to be posed within a short period before and after the release of release notes, with the average time interval between the post time of release notes and user reviews being approximately one year.

> The effectiveness and efficiency of 5G software stack vulnerability and unintended behavior detection are essential for 5G assurance, especially for its applications in critical infrastructures. Scalability and automation are the main challenges in testing approaches and cybersecurity research. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for automatically detecting vulnerabilities, unintended emergent behaviors, and performance degradation in 5G stacks via run-time profiling documents corresponding to fuzz testing in code repositories. Piloting on srsRAN, we map the run-time profiling via Logging Information (LogInfo) generated by fuzzing test to a high dimensional metric space first and then construct feature spaces based on their timestamp information. Lastly, we further leverage machine learning-based classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest to categorize the impacts on performance and security attributes. The performance of the proposed approach has high accuracy, ranging from $ 93.4 \% $ to $ 95.9 \% $, in detecting the fuzzing impacts. In addition, the proof of concept could identify and prioritize real-time vulnerabilities on 5G infrastructures and critical applications in various verticals.

> The rationale of this work is based on the current user trust discourse of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We aim to produce novel HCI approaches that use trust as a facilitator for the uptake (or appropriation) of current technologies. We propose a framework (HCTFrame) to guide non-experts to unlock the full potential of user trust in AI design. Results derived from a data triangulation of findings from three literature reviews demystify some misconceptions of user trust in computer science and AI discourse, and three case studies are conducted to assess the effectiveness of a psychometric scale in mapping potential users' trust breakdowns and concerns. This work primarily contributes to the fight against the tendency to design technical-centered vulnerable interactions, which can eventually lead to additional real and perceived breaches of trust. The proposed framework can be used to guide system designers on how to map and define user trust and the socioethical and organisational needs and characteristics of AI system design. It can also guide AI system designers on how to develop a prototype and operationalise a solution that meets user trust requirements. The article ends by providing some user research tools that can be employed to measure users' trust intentions and behaviours towards a proposed solution.

> 5G cellular systems are slowly being deployed worldwide delivering the promised unprecedented levels of throughput and latency to hundreds of millions of users. At such scale security is crucial, and consequently, the 5G standard includes a new series of features to improve the security of its predecessors (i.e., 3G and 4G). In this work, we evaluate the actual deployment in practice of the promised 5G security features by analysing current commercial 5G networks from several European operators. By collecting 5G signalling traffic in the wild in several cities in Spain, we i) fact-check which 5G security enhancements are actually implemented in current deployments, ii) provide a rich overview of the implementation status of each 5G security feature in a wide range of 5G commercial networks in Europe and compare it with previous results in China, iii) analyse the implications of optional features not being deployed, and iv) discuss on the still remaining 4G-inherited vulnerabilities. Our results show that in European 5G commercial networks, the deployment of the 5G security features is still on the works. This is well aligned with results previously reported from China [16] and keeps these networks vulnerable to some 4G attacks, during their migration period from 4G to 5G.

> Several open-source memory allocators have been ported to CHERI, a hardware capability platform. In this paper we examine the security and performance of these allocators when run under CheriBSD on Arm's experimental Morello platform. We introduce a number of security attacks and show that all but one allocator are vulnerable to some of the attacks - including the default CheriBSD allocator. We then show that while some forms of allocator performance are meaningful, comparing the performance of hybrid and pure capability (i.e. 'running in non-CHERI vs. running in CHERI modes') allocators does not appear to be meaningful. Although we do not fully understand the reasons for this, it seems to be at least as much due to factors such as immature compiler toolchains as it is due to the effects of capabilities on hardware.

> Technological advances in the telecommunications industry have brought significant advantages in the management and performance of communication networks. The railway industry is among the ones that have benefited the most. These interconnected systems, however, have a wide area exposed to cyberattacks. This survey examines the cybersecurity aspects of railway systems by considering the standards, guidelines, frameworks, and technologies used in the industry to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks, particularly regarding the relationship between safety and security. To do so, we dedicate specific attention to signaling, which fundamental reliance on computer and communication technologies allows us to explore better the multifaceted nature of the security of modern hyperconnected railway systems. With this in mind, we then move on to analyzing the approaches and tools that practitioners can use to facilitate the cyber security process. In detail, we present a view on cyber ranges as an enabling technology to model and emulate computer networks and attack-defense scenarios, study vulnerabilities' impact, and finally devise countermeasures. We also discuss several possible use cases strongly connected to the railway industry reality.

> The eBPF technology in the Linux kernel has been widely adopted for different applications, such as networking, tracing, and security, thanks to the programmability it provides. By allowing user-supplied eBPF programs to be executed directly in the kernel, it greatly increases the flexibility and efficiency of deploying customized logic. However, eBPF also introduces a new and wide attack surface: malicious eBPF programs may try to exploit the vulnerabilities in the eBPF subsystem in the kernel.   Fuzzing is a promising technique to find such vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, our experiments with the state-of-the-art kernel fuzzer, Syzkaller, shows that it cannot effectively fuzz the eBPF runtime, those components that are in charge of executing an eBPF program, for two reasons. First, the eBPF verifier (which is tasked with verifying the safety of eBPF programs) rejects many fuzzing inputs because (1) they do not comply with its required semantics or (2) they miss some dependencies, i.e., other syscalls that need to be issued before the program is loaded. Second, Syzkaller fails to attach and trigger the execution of eBPF programs most of the times.   This paper introduces the BPF Runtime Fuzzer (BRF), a fuzzer that can satisfy the semantics and dependencies required by the verifier and the eBPF subsystem. Our experiments show, in 48-hour fuzzing sessions, BRF can successfully execute 8x more eBPF programs compared to Syzkaller. Moreover, eBPF programs generated by BRF are much more expressive than Syzkaller's. As a result, BRF achieves 101% higher code coverage. Finally, BRF has so far managed to find 4 vulnerabilities (some of them have been assigned CVE numbers) in the eBPF runtime, proving its effectiveness.

> Hypergraphs are a powerful abstraction for modeling high-order relations, which are ubiquitous in many fields. A hypergraph consists of nodes and hyperedges (i.e., subsets of nodes); and there have been a number of attempts to extend the notion of $k$-cores, which proved useful with numerous applications for pairwise graphs, to hypergraphs. However, the previous extensions are based on an unrealistic assumption that hyperedges are fragile, i.e., a high-order relation becomes obsolete as soon as a single member leaves it.   In this work, we propose a new substructure model, called ($k$, $t$)-hypercore, based on the assumption that high-order relations remain as long as at least $t$ fraction of the members remain. Specifically, it is defined as the maximal subhypergraph where (1) every node is contained in at least $k$ hyperedges in it and (2) at least $t$ fraction of the nodes remain in every hyperedge. We first prove that, given $t$ (or $k$), finding the ($k$, $t$)-hypercore for every possible $k$ (or $t$) can be computed in time linear w.r.t the sum of the sizes of hyperedges. Then, we demonstrate that real-world hypergraphs from the same domain share similar ($k$, $t$)-hypercore structures, which capture different perspectives depending on $t$. Lastly, we show the successful applications of our model in identifying influential nodes, dense substructures, and vulnerability in hypergraphs.

> The competent programmer hypothesis states that most programmers are competent enough to create correct or almost correct source code. Because this implies that bugs should usually manifest through small variations of the correct code, the competent programmer hypothesis is one of the fundamental assumptions of mutation testing. Unfortunately, it is still unclear if the competent programmer hypothesis holds and past research presents contradictory claims. Within this article, we provide a new perspective on the competent programmer hypothesis and its relation to mutation testing. We try to re-create real-world bugs through chains of mutations to understand if there is a direct link between mutation testing and bugs. The lengths of these paths help us to understand if the source code is really almost correct, or if large variations are required. Our results indicate that while the competent programmer hypothesis seems to be true, mutation testing is missing important operators to generate representative real-world bugs.

> One of the biggest expense in software development is the maintenance. Therefore, it is critical to comprehend what triggers maintenance and if it may be predicted. Numerous research have demonstrated that specific methods of assessing the complexity of created programs may produce useful prediction models to ascertain the possibility of maintenance due to software failures. As a routine it is performed prior to the release, and setting up the models frequently calls for certain, object-oriented software measurements. It is not always the case that software developers have access to these measurements. In this paper, the machine learning is applied on the available data to calculate the cumulative software failure levels. A technique to forecast a software`s residual defectiveness using machine learning can be looked into as a solution to the challenge of predicting residual flaws. Software metrics and defect data were separated out of the static source code repository. Static code is used to create software metrics, and reported bugs in the repository are used to gather defect information. By using a correlation method, metrics that had no connection to the defect data were removed. This makes it possible to analyze all the data without pausing the programming process. Large, sophisticated software`s primary issue is that it is impossible to control everything manually, and the cost of an error can be quite expensive. Developers may miss errors during testing as a consequence, which will raise maintenance costs. Finding a method to accurately forecast software defects is the overall objective.

> Automated program repair is a crucial task for improving the efficiency of software developers. Recently, neural-based techniques have demonstrated significant promise in generating correct patches for buggy code snippets. However, most existing approaches arbitrarily treat the buggy context without any analysis to capture the semantic relationship between the buggy statement and its context. Additionally, we observe that existing neural models may output an unaltered patch consistent with the input buggy code snippet, which fails to be the correct human-written one for fixing the given bug. To address the aforementioned limitations, we present in this paper a novel neural program repair framework called \approach, which adapts the general pre-trained language model for fixing single-line Java bugs. We make the first attempt to use program slicing to extract contextual information directly related to the given buggy statement as repair ingredients from the corresponding program dependence graph and eliminate unaltered patches using an intuitive but effective filter mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of \approach on five benchmarks when compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

> The increasing digitalization of power grids and especially the shift towards IP-based communication drastically increase the susceptibility to cyberattacks, potentially leading to blackouts and physical damage. Understanding the involved risks, the interplay of communication and physical assets, and the effects of cyberattacks are paramount for the uninterrupted operation of this critical infrastructure. However, as the impact of cyberattacks cannot be researched in real-world power grids, current efforts tend to focus on analyzing isolated aspects at small scales, often covering only either physical or communication assets. To fill this gap, we present WATTSON, a comprehensive research environment that facilitates reproducing, implementing, and analyzing cyberattacks against power grids and, in particular, their impact on both communication and physical processes. We validate WATTSON's accuracy against a physical testbed and show its scalability to realistic power grid sizes. We then perform authentic cyberattacks, such as Industroyer, within the environment and study their impact on the power grid's energy and communication side. Besides known vulnerabilities, our results reveal the ripple effects of susceptible communication on complex cyber-physical processes and thus lay the foundation for effective countermeasures.

> Misinformation has become a significant issue in today's society, with the proliferation of false information through various mediums such as social media and traditional news sources. The rapid spread of misinformation has made it increasingly difficult for people to separate truth from fiction, and this has the potential to cause significant harm to individuals and society as a whole. In addition, there currently exists an information gap with regard to internet education, with many schools across America not having the teaching personnel nor resources to adequately educate their students about the dangers of the internet, specifically with regard to misinformation in the political sphere. To address the dangers of misinformation, some game developers have created video games that aim to educate players on the issue and help them develop critical thinking skills. These games can be used to raise awareness about the importance of verifying information before sharing it. By doing so, they can help reduce the spread of misinformation and promote a more informed and discerning public. They can also provide players with a safe and controlled environment to practice these skills and build confidence in their ability to evaluate information. However, these existing games often suffer from various shortcomings such as failing to adequately address how misinformation specifically exploits the biases within people to be effective and rarely covering how evolving modern technologies like sophisticated chatbots and deep fakes have made individuals even more vulnerable to misinformation. The purpose of this study is to create an educational misinformation game to address this information gap and investigate its efficacy as an educational tool while also iterating on the designs for previous games in the space.

> Mobile apps are indispensable for people's daily life, and automated GUI (Graphical User Interface) testing is widely used for app quality assurance. There is a growing interest in using learning-based techniques for automated GUI testing which aims at generating human-like actions and interactions. However, the limitations such as low testing coverage, weak generalization, and heavy reliance on training data, make an urgent need for a more effective approach to generate human-like actions to thoroughly test mobile apps. Inspired by the success of the Large Language Model (LLM), e.g., GPT-3 and ChatGPT, in natural language understanding and question answering, we formulate the mobile GUI testing problem as a Q&A task. We propose GPTDroid, asking LLM to chat with the mobile apps by passing the GUI page information to LLM to elicit testing scripts, and executing them to keep passing the app feedback to LLM, iterating the whole process. Within it, we extract the static context of the GUI page and the dynamic context of the iterative testing process, design prompts for inputting this information to LLM, and develop a neural matching network to decode the LLM's output into actionable steps to execute the app. We evaluate GPTDroid on 86 apps from Google Play, and its activity coverage is 71%, with 32% higher than the best baseline, and can detect 36% more bugs with faster speed than the best baseline. GPTDroid also detects 48 new bugs on the Google Play with 25 of them being confirmed/fixed. We further summarize the capabilities of GPTDroid behind the superior performance, including semantic text input, compound action, long meaningful test trace, and test case prioritization.

> Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a testing technique that can effectively alleviate the oracle problem. MT uses Metamorphic Relations (MRs) to determine if a test case passes or fails. MRs specify how the outputs should vary in response to specific input changes when executing the System Under Test (SUT). If a particular MR is violated for at least one test input (and its change), there is a high probability that the SUT has a fault. On the other hand, if a particular MR is not violated, it does not guarantee that the SUT is fault free. However, deciding if the MR is being violated due to a bug or because the MR does not hold/fit for particular conditions generated by specific inputs remains a manual task and unexplored. In this paper, we develop a method for refining MRs to offer hints as to whether a violation results from a bug or arises from the MR not being matched to certain test data under specific circumstances. In our initial proof-of-concept, we derive the relevant information from rules using the Association Rule Mining (ARM) technique. In our initial proof-of-concept, we validate our method on a toy example and discuss the lessons learned from our experiments. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates that our method is applicable and that we can provide suggestions that help strengthen the test suite for regression testing purposes.

> Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are small, imperceptible perturbations that can significantly alter the network's output. Conversely, there may exist large, meaningful perturbations that do not affect the network's decision (excessive invariance). In our research, we investigate this latter phenomenon in two contexts: (a) discrete-time dynamical system identification, and (b) the calibration of a neural network's output to that of another network. We examine noninvertibility through the lens of mathematical optimization, where the global solution measures the ``safety" of the network predictions by their distance from the non-invertibility boundary. We formulate mixed-integer programs (MIPs) for ReLU networks and $L_p$ norms ($p=1,2,\infty$) that apply to neural network approximators of dynamical systems. We also discuss how our findings can be useful for invertibility certification in transformations between neural networks, e.g. between different levels of network pruning.

> Split learning (splitNN) has emerged as a popular strategy for addressing the high computational costs and low modeling efficiency in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). However, despite its popularity, vanilla splitNN lacks encryption protection, leaving it vulnerable to privacy leakage issues, especially Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG). Motivated by the LLG issue resulting from the use of labels during training, we propose the Generative Adversarial Federated Model (GAFM), a novel method designed specifically to enhance label privacy protection by integrating splitNN with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GAFM leverages GANs to indirectly utilize label information by learning the label distribution rather than relying on explicit labels, thereby mitigating LLG. GAFM also employs an additional cross-entropy loss based on the noisy labels to further improve the prediction accuracy. Our ablation experiment demonstrates that the combination of GAN and the cross-entropy loss component is necessary to enable GAFM to mitigate LLG without significantly compromising the model utility. Empirical results on various datasets show that GAFM achieves a better and more robust trade-off between model utility and privacy compared to all baselines across multiple random runs. In addition, we provide experimental justification to substantiate GAFM's superiority over splitNN, demonstrating that it offers enhanced label protection through gradient perturbation relative to splitNN.

> We present CureSpec, the first model-checking based framework for automatic repair of programs with respect to information leaks in the presence of side-channels and speculative execution. CureSpec is based on formal models of attacker capabilities, including observable side channels, inspired by the Spectre attacks. For a given attacker model, CureSpec is able to either prove that the program is secure, or detect potential side-channel vulnerabilities and automatically insert mitigations such that the resulting code is provably secure. Moreover, CureSpec can provide a certificate for the security of the program that can be independently checked. We have implemented CureSpec in the SeaHorn framework and show that it can effectively repair security-critical code, for example the AES encryption from the OpenSSL library.

> Although using third-party libraries is common practice when writing software, vulnerabilities may be found even in well-known libraries. Detected vulnerabilities are often fixed quickly in the library code. The easiest way to include these fixes in a dependent software application, is to update the used library version. Package managers provide automated solutions for updating library dependencies. However, library dependencies can have dependencies to other libraries resulting in a dependency network with several levels of indirections. Assessing vulnerability risks induced by dependency networks is a non-trivial task for software developers. The library dependency network in the Swift ecosystem encompasses libraries from CocoaPods, Carthage and Swift Package Manager. We analysed how vulnerabilities propagate in the library dependency network of the Swift ecosystem, how vulnerable dependencies could be fixed via dependency upgrades, and if third party vulnerability analysis could be made more precise given public information on these vulnerabilities. We found that only 5.9% of connected libraries had a direct or transitive dependency to a vulnerable library. Although we found that most libraries with publicly reported vulnerabilities are written in C, the highest impact of publicly reported vulnerabilities originated from libraries written in native iOS languages. We found that around 30% of vulnerable dependencies could have been fixed via upgrading the library dependency. In case of critical vulnerabilities and latest library versions, over 70% of vulnerable dependencies would have been fixed via a dependency upgrade. Lastly, we checked whether the analysis of vulnerable dependency use could be refined using publicly available information on the code location (method or class) of a reported vulnerability. We found that such information is not available most of the time.

> GitHub is a popular repository for hosting software projects, both due to ease of use and the seamless integration with its testing environment. Native GitHub Actions make it easy for software developers to validate new commits and have confidence that new code does not introduce major bugs. The freely available test environments are limited to only a few popular setups but can be extended with custom Action Runners. Our team had access to a Kubernetes cluster with GPU accelerators, so we explored the feasibility of automatically deploying GPU-providing runners there. All available Kubernetes-based setups, however, require cluster-admin level privileges. To address this problem, we developed a simple custom setup that operates in a completely unprivileged manner. In this paper we provide a summary description of the setup and our experience using it in the context of two Knight lab projects on the Prototype National Research Platform system.

> Large-scale software development has become a highly collaborative and geographically distributed endeavour, especially in open-source software development ecosystems and their associated developer communities. It has given rise to modern development processes (e.g., pull-based development) that involve a wide range of activities such as issue and bug handling, code reviewing, coding, testing, and deployment. These often very effort-intensive activities are supported by a wide variety of tools such as version control systems, bug and issue trackers, code reviewing systems, code quality analysis tools, test automation, dependency management, and vulnerability detection tools. To reduce the complexity of the collaborative development process, many of the repetitive human activities that are part of the development workflow are being automated by CI/CD tools that help to increase the productivity and quality of software projects. Social coding platforms aim to integrate all this tooling and workflow automation in a single encompassing environment. These social coding platforms gave rise to the emergence of development bots, facilitating the integration with external CI/CD tools and enabling the automation of many other development-related tasks. GitHub, the most popular social coding platform, has introduced GitHub Actions to automate workflows in its hosted software development repositories since November 2019. This chapter explores the ecosystems of development bots and GitHub Actions and their interconnection. It provides an extensive survey of the state-of-the-art in this domain, discusses the opportunities and threats that these ecosystems entail, and reports on the challenges and future perspectives for researchers as well as software practitioners.

> Many applications are being written in more than one language to take advantage of the features that different languages provide such as native code support, improved performance, and language-specific libraries. However, there are few static analysis tools currently available to analyse the source code of such multilingual applications. Existing work on cross-language (Java and C/C++) analysis fails to detect buffer overflow vulnerabilities that are of cross-language nature. In this work, we are addressing how to do cross-language analysis between Java and C/C++. Specifically, we propose an approach to do data flow analysis between Java and C/C++ to detect buffer overflow. We have developed PilaiPidi, a tool that can automatically analyse the data flow in projects written in Java and C/C++. Using our approach, we were able to detect 23 buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which are of cross-language nature, in six different well-known Android applications, and out of these, developers have confirmed 11 vulnerabilities in three applications.

> Adversarial attack is commonly regarded as a huge threat to neural networks because of misleading behavior. This paper presents an opposite perspective: adversarial attacks can be harnessed to improve neural models if amended correctly. Unlike traditional adversarial defense or adversarial training schemes that aim to improve the adversarial robustness, the proposed adversarial amendment (AdvAmd) method aims to improve the original accuracy level of neural models on benign samples. We thoroughly analyze the distribution mismatch between the benign and adversarial samples. This distribution mismatch and the mutual learning mechanism with the same learning ratio applied in prior art defense strategies is the main cause leading the accuracy degradation for benign samples. The proposed AdvAmd is demonstrated to steadily heal the accuracy degradation and even leads to a certain accuracy boost of common neural models on benign classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. The efficacy of the AdvAmd is contributed by three key components: mediate samples (to reduce the influence of distribution mismatch with a fine-grained amendment), auxiliary batch norm (to solve the mutual learning mechanism and the smoother judgment surface), and AdvAmd loss (to adjust the learning ratios according to different attack vulnerabilities) through quantitative and ablation experiments.

> Fingerprint authentication has been widely adopted on smartphones to complement traditional password authentication, making it a tempting target for attackers. The smartphone industry is fully aware of existing threats, and especially for the presentation attack studied by most prior works, the threats are nearly eliminated by liveness detection and attempt limit. In this paper, we study the seemingly impossible fingerprint brute-force attack on off-the-shelf smartphones and propose a generic attack framework. We implement BrutePrint to automate the attack, that acts as a middleman to bypass attempt limit and hijack fingerprint images. Specifically, the bypassing exploits two zero-day vulnerabilities in smartphone fingerprint authentication (SFA) framework, and the hijacking leverages the simplicity of SPI protocol. Moreover, we consider a practical cross-device attack scenario and tackle the liveness and matching problems with neural style transfer (NST). We also propose a method based on neural style transfer to generate valid brute-forcing inputs from arbitrary fingerprint images. A case study shows that we always bypasses liveness detection and attempt limit while 71% spoofs are accepted. We evaluate BrutePrint on 10 representative smartphones from top-5 vendors and 3 typical types of applications involving screen lock, payment, and privacy. As all of them are vulnerable to some extent, fingerprint brute-force attack is validated on on all devices except iPhone, where the shortest time to unlock the smartphone without prior knowledge about the victim is estimated at 40 minutes. Furthermore, we suggest software and hardware mitigation measures.

> In overhead image segmentation tasks, including additional spectral bands beyond the traditional RGB channels can improve model performance. However, it is still unclear how incorporating this additional data impacts model robustness to adversarial attacks and natural perturbations. For adversarial robustness, the additional information could improve the model's ability to distinguish malicious inputs, or simply provide new attack avenues and vulnerabilities. For natural perturbations, the additional information could better inform model decisions and weaken perturbation effects or have no significant influence at all. In this work, we seek to characterize the performance and robustness of a multispectral (RGB and near infrared) image segmentation model subjected to adversarial attacks and natural perturbations. While existing adversarial and natural robustness research has focused primarily on digital perturbations, we prioritize on creating realistic perturbations designed with physical world conditions in mind. For adversarial robustness, we focus on data poisoning attacks whereas for natural robustness, we focus on extending ImageNet-C common corruptions for fog and snow that coherently and self-consistently perturbs the input data. Overall, we find both RGB and multispectral models are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks regardless of input or fusion architectures and that while physically realizable natural perturbations still degrade model performance, the impact differs based on fusion architecture and input data.

> Learning on graphs is becoming prevalent in a wide range of applications including social networks, robotics, communication, medicine, etc. These datasets belonging to entities often contain critical private information. The utilization of data for graph learning applications is hampered by the growing privacy concerns from users on data sharing. Existing privacy-preserving methods pre-process the data to extract user-side features, and only these features are used for subsequent learning. Unfortunately, these methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks to infer private attributes. We present a novel privacy-respecting framework for distributed graph learning and graph-based machine learning. In order to perform graph learning and other downstream tasks on the server side, this framework aims to learn features as well as distances without requiring actual features while preserving the original structural properties of the raw data. The proposed framework is quite generic and highly adaptable. We demonstrate the utility of the Euclidean space, but it can be applied with any existing method of distance approximation and graph learning for the relevant spaces. Through extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in terms of comparing the results obtained without data sharing to those obtained with data sharing as a benchmark. This is, to our knowledge, the first privacy-preserving distributed graph learning framework.

> BACKGROUND: Software engineers must be vigilant in preventing and correcting vulnerabilities and other critical bugs. In servicing this need, numerous tools and techniques have been developed to assist developers. Fuzzers, by autonomously generating inputs to test programs, promise to save time by detecting memory corruption, input handling, exception cases, and other issues.   AIMS: The goal of this work is to empower developers to prioritize their quality assurance by analyzing the history of bugs generated by OSS-Fuzz. Specifically, we examined what has happened when a project adopts fuzzing as a quality assurance practice by measuring bug lifespans, learning opportunities, and bug types.   METHOD: We analyzed 44,102 reported issues made public by OSS-Fuzz prior to March 12, 2022. We traced the Git commit ranges reported by repeated fuzz testing to the source code repositories to identify how long fuzzing bugs remained in the system, who fixes these bugs, and what types of problems fuzzers historically have found. We identified the bug-contributing commits to estimate when the bug containing code was introduced, and measure the timeline from introduction to detection to fix.   RESULTS: We found that bugs detected in OSS-Fuzz have a median lifespan of 324 days, but that bugs, once detected, only remain unaddressed for a median of 2 days. Further, we found that of the 8,099 issues for which a source committing author can be identified, less than half (45.9%) of issues were fixed by the same author that introduced the bug.   CONCLUSIONS: The results show that fuzzing can be used to makes a positive impact on a project that takes advantage in terms of their ability to address bugs in a time frame conducive to fixing mistakes prior to a product release.

> Software engineering techniques are increasingly relying on deep learning approaches to support many software engineering tasks, from bug triaging to code generation. To assess the efficacy of such techniques researchers typically perform controlled experiments. Conducting these experiments, however, is particularly challenging given the complexity of the space of variables involved, from specialized and intricate architectures and algorithms to a large number of training hyper-parameters and choices of evolving datasets, all compounded by how rapidly the machine learning technology is advancing, and the inherent sources of randomness in the training process. In this work we conduct a mapping study, examining 194 experiments with techniques that rely on deep neural networks appearing in 55 papers published in premier software engineering venues to provide a characterization of the state-of-the-practice, pinpointing experiments common trends and pitfalls. Our study reveals that most of the experiments, including those that have received ACM artifact badges, have fundamental limitations that raise doubts about the reliability of their findings. More specifically, we find: weak analyses to determine that there is a true relationship between independent and dependent variables (87% of the experiments); limited control over the space of DNN relevant variables, which can render a relationship between dependent variables and treatments that may not be causal but rather correlational (100% of the experiments); and lack of specificity in terms of what are the DNN variables and their values utilized in the experiments (86% of the experiments) to define the treatments being applied, which makes it unclear whether the techniques designed are the ones being assessed, or how the sources of extraneous variation are controlled. We provide some practical recommendations to address these limitations.

> Sensing technologies deployed in the workplace can unobtrusively collect detailed data about individual activities and group interactions that are otherwise difficult to capture. A hopeful application of these technologies is that they can help businesses and workers optimize productivity and wellbeing. However, given the workplace's inherent and structural power dynamics, the prevalent approach of accepting tacit compliance to monitor work activities rather than seeking workers' meaningful consent raises privacy and ethical concerns. This paper unpacks the challenges workers face when consenting to workplace wellbeing technologies. Using a hypothetical case to prompt reflection among six multi-stakeholder focus groups involving 15 participants, we explored participants' expectations and capacity to consent to these technologies. We sketched possible interventions that could better support meaningful consent to workplace wellbeing technologies by drawing on critical computing and feminist scholarship -- which reframes consent from a purely individual choice to a structural condition experienced at the individual level that needs to be freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, and specific (FRIES). The focus groups revealed how workers are vulnerable to "meaningless" consent -- as they may be subject to power dynamics that minimize their ability to withhold consent and may thus experience an erosion of autonomy, also undermining the value of data gathered in the name of "wellbeing." To meaningfully consent, participants wanted changes to the technology and to the policies and practices surrounding the technology. Our mapping of what prevents workers from meaningfully consenting to workplace wellbeing technologies (challenges) and what they require to do so (interventions) illustrates how the lack of meaningful consent is a structural problem requiring socio-technical solutions.

> Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining popularity as a collaborative learning framework to train deep learning-based object detection models over a distributed population of clients. Despite its advantages, FL is vulnerable to model hijacking. The attacker can control how the object detection system should misbehave by implanting Trojaned gradients using only a small number of compromised clients in the collaborative learning process. This paper introduces STDLens, a principled approach to safeguarding FL against such attacks. We first investigate existing mitigation mechanisms and analyze their failures caused by the inherent errors in spatial clustering analysis on gradients. Based on the insights, we introduce a three-tier forensic framework to identify and expel Trojaned gradients and reclaim the performance over the course of FL. We consider three types of adaptive attacks and demonstrate the robustness of STDLens against advanced adversaries. Extensive experiments show that STDLens can protect FL against different model hijacking attacks and outperform existing methods in identifying and removing Trojaned gradients with significantly higher precision and much lower false-positive rates.

> The robustness of recommender systems under node injection attacks has garnered significant attention. Recently, GraphRfi, a GNN-based recommender system, was proposed and shown to effectively mitigate the impact of injected fake users. However, we demonstrate that GraphRfi remains vulnerable to attacks due to the supervised nature of its fraudster detection component, where obtaining clean labels is challenging in practice. In particular, we propose a powerful poisoning attack, MetaC, against both GNN-based and MF-based recommender systems. Furthermore, we analyze why GraphRfi fails under such an attack. Then, based on our insights obtained from vulnerability analysis, we design an adaptive fraudster detection module that explicitly considers label uncertainty. This module can serve as a plug-in for different recommender systems, resulting in a robust framework named PDR. Comprehensive experiments show that our defense approach outperforms other benchmark methods under attacks. Overall, our research presents an effective framework for integrating fraudster detection into recommendation systems to achieve adversarial robustness.

> The widespread code reuse allows vulnerabilities to proliferate among a vast variety of firmware. There is an urgent need to detect these vulnerable code effectively and efficiently. By measuring code similarities, AI-based binary code similarity detection is applied to detecting vulnerable code at scale. Existing studies have proposed various function features to capture the commonality for similarity detection. Nevertheless, the significant code syntactic variability induced by the diversity of IoT hardware architectures diminishes the accuracy of binary code similarity detection. In our earlier study and the tool Asteria, we adopt a Tree-LSTM network to summarize function semantics as function commonality and the evaluation result indicates an advanced performance. However, it still has utility concerns due to excessive time costs and inadequate precision while searching for large-scale firmware bugs.   To this end, we propose a novel deep learning enhancement architecture by incorporating domain knowledge-based pre-filtration and re-ranking modules, and we develop a prototype based on Asteria called Asteria-Pro. Pre-filtration module seeks to eliminates dissimilar functions to boost subsequent deep learning model calculations, while re-ranking module aims to raises the rankings of vulnerable functions among candidates generated by deep learning model. Our evaluation indicates that pre-filtration module cuts the calculation time by 96.9% and re-ranking improves MRR and Recall by 23.71% and 36.4%. By incorporating the pre-filtration and re-ranking modules, Asteria-Pro outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in bug search task, by a significant large margin. We conduct a large-scale real-world firmware bug search and Asteria-Pro manages to detect 1,482 vulnerable functions with a high precision 91.65%.

- `2208.07589v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07589v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07589v2)

> With the proliferation of user-generated online videos, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has attracted increasing attention recently. Despite significant progress, there are still two major challenges on the way towards robust MSA: 1) inefficiency when modeling cross-modal interactions in unaligned multimodal data; and 2) vulnerability to random modality feature missing which typically occurs in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose a generic and unified framework to address them, named Efficient Multimodal Transformer with Dual-Level Feature Restoration (EMT-DLFR). Concretely, EMT employs utterance-level representations from each modality as the global multimodal context to interact with local unimodal features and mutually promote each other. It not only avoids the quadratic scaling cost of previous local-local cross-modal interaction methods but also leads to better performance. To improve model robustness in the incomplete modality setting, on the one hand, DLFR performs low-level feature reconstruction to implicitly encourage the model to learn semantic information from incomplete data. On the other hand, it innovatively regards complete and incomplete data as two different views of one sample and utilizes siamese representation learning to explicitly attract their high-level representations. Comprehensive experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.

- *Kun Li, Fan Zhang, Wei Guo*

- `2305.12770v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12770v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12770v1)

> Malware detection models based on deep learning have been widely used, but recent research shows that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are to deceive the deep learning model by generating adversarial samples. When adversarial attacks are performed on the malware detection model, the attacker will generate adversarial malware with the same malicious functions as the malware, and make the detection model classify it as benign software. Studying adversarial malware generation can help model designers improve the robustness of malware detection models. At present, in the work on adversarial malware generation for byte-to-image malware detection models, there are mainly problems such as large amount of injection perturbation and low generation efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes FGAM (Fast Generate Adversarial Malware), a method for fast generating adversarial malware, which iterates perturbed bytes according to the gradient sign to enhance adversarial capability of the perturbed bytes until the adversarial malware is successfully generated. It is experimentally verified that the success rate of the adversarial malware deception model generated by FGAM is increased by about 84\% compared with existing methods.

> Adversarial attacks against Deep Neural Networks(DNN) have been a crutial topic ever since \cite{goodfellow} purposed the vulnerability of DNNs. However, most prior works craft adversarial examples in the pixel space, following the $l_p$ norm constraint. In this paper, we give intuitional explain about why crafting adversarial examples in the latent space is equally efficient and important. We purpose a framework for crafting adversarial examples in semantic latent space based on an pre-trained Variational Auto Encoder from state-of-art Stable Diffusion Model\cite{SDM}. We also show that adversarial examples crafted in the latent space can also achieve a high level of fool rate. However, examples crafted from latent space are often hard to evaluated, as they doesn't follow a certain $l_p$ norm constraint, which is a big challenge for existing researches. To efficiently and accurately evaluate the adversarial examples crafted in the latent space, we purpose \textbf{a novel evaluation matric} based on SSIM\cite{SSIM} loss and fool rate.Additionally, we explain why FID\cite{FID} is not suitable for measuring such adversarial examples. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first evaluation metrics that is specifically designed to evaluate the quality of a adversarial attack. We also investigate the transferability of adversarial examples crafted in the latent space and show that they have superiority over adversarial examples crafted in the pixel space.

> The generative AI revolution in recent years has been spurred by an expansion in compute power and data quantity, which together enable extensive pre-training of powerful text-to-image (T2I) models. With their greater capabilities to generate realistic and creative content, these T2I models like DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagen or Stable Diffusion are reaching ever wider audiences. Any unsafe behaviors inherited from pretraining on uncurated internet-scraped datasets thus have the potential to cause wide-reaching harm, for example, through generated images which are violent, sexually explicit, or contain biased and derogatory stereotypes. Despite this risk of harm, we lack systematic and structured evaluation datasets to scrutinize model behavior, especially adversarial attacks that bypass existing safety filters. A typical bottleneck in safety evaluation is achieving a wide coverage of different types of challenging examples in the evaluation set, i.e., identifying 'unknown unknowns' or long-tail problems. To address this need, we introduce the Adversarial Nibbler challenge. The goal of this challenge is to crowdsource a diverse set of failure modes and reward challenge participants for successfully finding safety vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art T2I models. Ultimately, we aim to provide greater awareness of these issues and assist developers in improving the future safety and reliability of generative AI models. Adversarial Nibbler is a data-centric challenge, part of the DataPerf challenge suite, organized and supported by Kaggle and MLCommons.

- *Alessandro Fontana*

> Despite the success of neural networks, the issue of classification robustness remains, particularly highlighted by adversarial examples. In this paper, we address this challenge by focusing on the continuum of functions implemented in artificial neurons, ranging from pure AND gates to pure OR gates. Our hypothesis is that the presence of a sufficient number of OR-like neurons in a network can lead to classification brittleness and increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We define AND-like neurons and propose measures to increase their proportion in the network. These measures involve rescaling inputs to the [-1,1] interval and reducing the number of points in the steepest section of the sigmoidal activation function. A crucial component of our method is the comparison between a neuron's output distribution when fed with the actual dataset and a randomised version called the "scrambled dataset." Experimental results on the MNIST dataset suggest that our approach holds promise as a direction for further exploration.

> In the last decade, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transformer based object detectors have achieved high performance on a large variety of datasets. Though the majority of detection literature has developed this capability on datasets such as MS COCO, these detectors have still proven effective for remote sensing applications. Challenges in this particular domain, such as small numbers of annotated objects and low object density, hinder overall performance. In this work, we present a novel augmentation method, called collage pasting, for increasing the object density without a need for segmentation masks, thereby improving the detector performance. We demonstrate that collage pasting improves precision and recall beyond related methods, such as mosaic augmentation, and enables greater control of object density. However, we find that collage pasting is vulnerable to certain out-of-distribution shifts, such as image corruptions. To address this, we introduce two simple approaches for combining collage pasting with PixMix augmentation method, and refer to our combined techniques as ColMix. Through extensive experiments, we show that employing ColMix results in detectors with superior performance on aerial imagery datasets and robust to various corruptions.

> This survey is on forward-looking, emerging security concerns in post-quantum era, i.e., the implementation attacks for 2022 winners of NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) competition and thus the visions, insights, and discussions can be used as a step forward towards scrutinizing the new standards for applications ranging from Metaverse, Web 3.0 to deeply-embedded systems. The rapid advances in quantum computing have brought immense opportunities for scientific discovery and technological progress; however, it poses a major risk to today's security since advanced quantum computers are believed to break all traditional public-key cryptographic algorithms. This has led to active research on PQC algorithms that are believed to be secure against classical and powerful quantum computers. However, algorithmic security is unfortunately insufficient, and many cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable to side-channel attacks (SCA), where an attacker passively or actively gets side-channel data to compromise the security properties that are assumed to be safe theoretically. In this survey, we explore such imminent threats and their countermeasures with respect to PQC. We provide the respective, latest advancements in PQC research, as well as assessments and providing visions on the different types of SCAs.

> Software vulnerabilities bear enterprises significant costs. Despite extensive efforts in research and development of software vulnerability detection methods, uncaught vulnerabilities continue to put software owners and users at risk. Many current vulnerability detection methods require that code snippets can compile and build before attempting detection. This, unfortunately, introduces a long latency between the time a vulnerability is injected to the time it is removed, which can substantially increases the cost of fixing a vulnerability. We recognize that the current advances in machine learning can be used to detect vulnerable code patterns on syntactically incomplete code snippets as the developer is writing the code at EditTime. In this paper we present a practical system that leverages deep learning on a large-scale data set of vulnerable code patterns to learn complex manifestations of more than 250 vulnerability types and detect vulnerable code patterns at EditTime. We discuss zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches on state of the art pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). We show that in comparison with state of the art vulnerability detection models our approach improves the state of the art by 10%. We also evaluate our approach to detect vulnerability in auto-generated code by code LLMs. Evaluation on a benchmark of high-risk code scenarios shows a reduction of up to 90% vulnerability reduction.

> The Internet revolution in 1990, followed by the data-driven and information revolution, has transformed the world as we know it. Nowadays, what seam to be 10 to 20 years ago, a science fiction idea (i.e., machines dominating the world) is seen as possible. This revolution also brought a need for new regulatory practices where user trust and artificial Intelligence (AI) discourse has a central role. This work aims to clarify some misconceptions about user trust in AI discourse and fight the tendency to design vulnerable interactions that lead to further breaches of trust, both real and perceived. Findings illustrate the lack of clarity in understanding user trust and its effects on computer science, especially in measuring user trust characteristics. It argues for clarifying those notions to avoid possible trust gaps and misinterpretations in AI adoption and appropriation.

> With the increasing reliance on Open Source Software, users are exposed to third-party library vulnerabilities. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools have been created to alert users of such vulnerabilities. SCA requires the identification of vulnerability-fixing commits. Prior works have proposed methods that can automatically identify such vulnerability-fixing commits. However, identifying such commits is highly challenging, as only a very small minority of commits are vulnerability fixing. Moreover, code changes can be noisy and difficult to analyze. We observe that noise can occur at different levels of detail, making it challenging to detect vulnerability fixes accurately.   To address these challenges and boost the effectiveness of prior works, we propose MiDas (Multi-Granularity Detector for Vulnerability Fixes). Unique from prior works, Midas constructs different neural networks for each level of code change granularity, corresponding to commit-level, file-level, hunk-level, and line-level, following their natural organization. It then utilizes an ensemble model that combines all base models to generate the final prediction. This design allows MiDas to better handle the noisy and highly imbalanced nature of vulnerability-fixing commit data. Additionally, to reduce the human effort required to inspect code changes, we have designed an effort-aware adjustment for Midas's outputs based on commit length. The evaluation results demonstrate that MiDas outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline in terms of AUC by 4.9% and 13.7% on Java and Python-based datasets, respectively. Furthermore, in terms of two effort-aware metrics, EffortCost@L and Popt@L, MiDas also outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, achieving improvements of up to 28.2% and 15.9% on Java, and 60% and 51.4% on Python, respectively.

> Recent research has demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the resilience of advanced DNNs to adversarial attacks. However, traditional methods that use stickers as physical perturbations to deceive classifiers face challenges in achieving stealthiness and are susceptible to printing loss. Recently, advancements in physical attacks have utilized light beams, such as lasers, to perform attacks, where the optical patterns generated are artificial rather than natural. In this work, we propose a black-box projector-based physical attack, referred to as adversarial color projection (AdvCP), which manipulates the physical parameters of color projection to perform an adversarial attack. We evaluate our approach on three crucial criteria: effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. In the digital environment, we achieve an attack success rate of 97.60% on a subset of ImageNet, while in the physical environment, we attain an attack success rate of 100% in the indoor test and 82.14% in the outdoor test. The adversarial samples generated by AdvCP are compared with baseline samples to demonstrate the stealthiness of our approach. When attacking advanced DNNs, experimental results show that our method can achieve more than 85% attack success rate in all cases, which verifies the robustness of AdvCP. Finally, we consider the potential threats posed by AdvCP to future vision-based systems and applications and suggest some ideas for light-based physical attacks.

> Short text clustering is challenging since it takes imbalanced and noisy data as inputs. Existing approaches cannot solve this problem well, since (1) they are prone to obtain degenerate solutions especially on heavy imbalanced datasets, and (2) they are vulnerable to noises. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Robust Short Text Clustering (RSTC) model to improve robustness against imbalanced and noisy data. RSTC includes two modules, i.e., pseudo-label generation module and robust representation learning module. The former generates pseudo-labels to provide supervision for the later, which contributes to more robust representations and correctly separated clusters. To provide robustness against the imbalance in data, we propose self-adaptive optimal transport in the pseudo-label generation module. To improve robustness against the noise in data, we further introduce both class-wise and instance-wise contrastive learning in the robust representation learning module. Our empirical studies on eight short text clustering datasets demonstrate that RSTC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models. The code is available at: https://github.com/hmllmh/RSTC.

> Despite Wi-Fi is at the eve of its seventh generation, security concerns regarding this omnipresent technology remain in the spotlight of the research community. This work introduces two new denial of service attacks against contemporary Wi-Fi 5 and 6 networks. Differently to similar works in the literature which focus on 802.11 management frames, the introduced assaults exploit control frames. Both the attacks target the central element of any infrastructure-based 802.11 network, i.e., the access point (AP), and result in depriving the associated stations from any service. We demonstrate that, at the very least, the attacks affect a great mass of off-the-self AP implementations by different renowned vendors, and it can be mounted with inexpensive equipment, little effort, and a low level of expertise. With reference to the latest standard, namely, 802.11-2020, we elaborate on the root cause of the respected vulnerabilities, pinpointing shortcomings. Following a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, our findings have been promptly communicated to each affected AP vendor, already receiving positive feedback as well as a - currently reserved - common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) id, namely CVE-2022-32666.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made remarkable strides in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and object detection. However, recent research has revealed a vulnerability in advanced DNNs when faced with deliberate manipulations of input data, known as adversarial attacks. Moreover, the accuracy of DNNs is heavily influenced by the distribution of the training dataset. Distortions or perturbations in the color space of input images can introduce out-of-distribution data, resulting in misclassification. In this work, we propose a brightness-variation dataset, which incorporates 24 distinct brightness levels for each image within a subset of ImageNet. This dataset enables us to simulate the effects of light and shadow on the images, so as is to investigate the impact of light and shadow on the performance of DNNs. In our study, we conduct experiments using several state-of-the-art DNN architectures on the aforementioned dataset. Through our analysis, we discover a noteworthy positive correlation between the brightness levels and the loss of accuracy in DNNs. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of recently proposed robust training techniques and strategies, including AugMix, Revisit, and Free Normalizer, using the ResNet50 architecture on our brightness-variation dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that these techniques can enhance the robustness of DNNs against brightness variation, leading to improved performance when dealing with images exhibiting varying brightness levels.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have have shown state-of-the-art performance for computer vision applications like image classification, segmentation and object detection. Whereas recent advances have shown their vulnerability to manual digital perturbations in the input data, namely adversarial attacks. The accuracy of the networks is significantly affected by the data distribution of their training dataset. Distortions or perturbations on color space of input images generates out-of-distribution data, which make networks more likely to misclassify them. In this work, we propose a color-variation dataset by distorting their RGB color on a subset of the ImageNet with 27 different combinations. The aim of our work is to study the impact of color variation on the performance of DNNs. We perform experiments on several state-of-the-art DNN architectures on the proposed dataset, and the result shows a significant correlation between color variation and loss of accuracy. Furthermore, based on the ResNet50 architecture, we demonstrate some experiments of the performance of recently proposed robust training techniques and strategies, such as Augmix, revisit, and free normalizer, on our proposed dataset. Experimental results indicate that these robust training techniques can improve the robustness of deep networks to color variation.

> Vulnerability identification constitutes a task of high importance for cyber security. It is quite helpful for locating and fixing vulnerable functions in large applications. However, this task is rather challenging owing to the absence of reliable and adequately managed datasets and learning models. Existing solutions typically rely on human expertise to annotate datasets or specify features, which is prone to error. In addition, the learning models have a high rate of false positives. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a properly curated C/C++ source code vulnerability dataset, denoted as CVEFunctionGraphEmbeddings (CVEFGE), to aid in developing models. CVEFGE is automatically crawled from the CVE database, which contains authentic and publicly disclosed source code vulnerabilities. We also propose a learning framework based on graph neural networks, denoted SEquential Graph Neural Network (SEGNN) for learning a large number of code semantic representations. SEGNN consists of a sequential learning module, graph convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Our evaluations on two datasets and four baseline methods in a graph classification setting demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

In this work, we present a simple approach to fool state-of-the-art machine translation tools in the task of translation from Russian to English and vice versa. Using a novel black-box gradient-free tensor-based optimizer, we show that many online translation tools, such as Google, DeepL, and Yandex, may both produce wrong or offensive translations for nonsensical adversarial input queries and refuse to translate seemingly benign input phrases. This vulnerability may interfere with understanding a new language and simply worsen the user's experience while using machine translation systems, and, hence, additional improvements of these tools are required to establish better translation.

> This paper examines free content websites (FCWs) and premium content websites (PCWs) in different countries, comparing them to general websites. The focus is on the distribution of malicious websites and their correlation with the national cyber security index (NCSI), which measures a country's cyber security maturity and its ability to deter the hosting of such malicious websites. By analyzing a dataset comprising 1,562 FCWs and PCWs, along with Alexa's top million websites dataset sample, we discovered that a majority of the investigated websites are hosted in the United States. Interestingly, the United States has a relatively low NCSI, mainly due to a lower score in privacy policy development. Similar patterns were observed for other countries With varying NCSI criteria. Furthermore, we present the distribution of various categories of FCWs and PCWs across countries. We identify the top hosting countries for each category and provide the percentage of discovered malicious websites in those countries. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to identify regional vulnerabilities in hosting FCWs and guide policy improvements at the country level to mitigate potential cyber threats.

> Anthropomorphization is the tendency to attribute human-like traits to non-human entities. It is prevalent in many social contexts -- children anthropomorphize toys, adults do so with brands, and it is a literary device. It is also a versatile tool in science, with behavioral psychology and evolutionary biology meticulously documenting its consequences. With widespread adoption of AI systems, and the push from stakeholders to make it human-like through alignment techniques, human voice, and pictorial avatars, the tendency for users to anthropomorphize it increases significantly. We take a dyadic approach to understanding this phenomenon with large language models (LLMs) by studying (1) the objective legal implications, as analyzed through the lens of the recent blueprint of AI bill of rights and the (2) subtle psychological aspects customization and anthropomorphization. We find that anthropomorphized LLMs customized for different user bases violate multiple provisions in the legislative blueprint. In addition, we point out that anthropomorphization of LLMs affects the influence they can have on their users, thus having the potential to fundamentally change the nature of human-AI interaction, with potential for manipulation and negative influence. With LLMs being hyper-personalized for vulnerable groups like children and patients among others, our work is a timely and important contribution. We propose a conservative strategy for the cautious use of anthropomorphization to improve trustworthiness of AI systems.

> WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level binary format for web applications, which has found widespread adoption due to its improved performance and compatibility with existing software. However, the popularity of Wasm has also led to its exploitation for malicious purposes, such as cryptojacking, where malicious actors use a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent. To counteract this threat, machine learning-based detection methods aiming to identify cryptojacking activities within Wasm code have emerged. It is well-known that neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where inputs to a classifier are perturbed with minimal changes that result in a crass misclassification. While applying changes in image classification is easy, manipulating binaries in an automated fashion to evade malware classification without changing functionality is non-trivial. In this work, we propose a new approach to include adversarial examples in the code section of binaries via instrumentation. The introduced gadgets allow for the inclusion of arbitrary bytes, enabling efficient adversarial attacks that reliably bypass state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers such as the CNN-based Minos recently proposed at NDSS 2021. We analyze the cost and reliability of instrumentation-based adversarial example generation and show that the approach works reliably at minimal size and performance overheads.

> The Internet of Things(IoT) paradigm provides persistent sensing and data collection capabilities and is becoming increasingly prevalent across many market sectors. However, most IoT devices emphasize usability and function over security, making them very vulnerable to malicious exploits. This concern is evidenced by the increased use of compromised IoT devices in large scale bot networks (botnets) to launch distributed denial of service(DDoS) attacks against high value targets. Unsecured IoT systems can also provide entry points to private networks, allowing adversaries relatively easy access to valuable resources and services. Indeed, these evolving IoT threat vectors (ranging from brute force attacks to remote code execution exploits) are posing key challenges. Moreover, many traditional security mechanisms are not amenable for deployment on smaller resource-constrained IoT platforms. As a result, researchers have been developing a range of methods for IoT security, with many strategies using advanced machine learning(ML) techniques. Along these lines, this paper presents a novel generative adversarial network(GAN) solution to detect threats from malicious IoT devices both inside and outside a network. This model is trained using both benign IoT traffic and global darknet data and further evaluated in a testbed with real IoT devices and malware threats.

- `2305.15336v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15336v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15336v1)

> This research article critically examines the potential risks and implications arising from the malicious utilization of large language models(LLM), focusing specifically on ChatGPT and Google's Bard. Although these large language models have numerous beneficial applications, the misuse of this technology by cybercriminals for creating offensive payloads and tools is a significant concern. In this study, we systematically generated implementable code for the top-10 MITRE Techniques prevalent in 2022, utilizing ChatGPT, and conduct a comparative analysis of its performance with Google's Bard. Our experimentation reveals that ChatGPT has the potential to enable attackers to accelerate the operation of more targeted and sophisticated attacks. Additionally, the technology provides amateur attackers with more capabilities to perform a wide range of attacks and empowers script kiddies to develop customized tools that contribute to the acceleration of cybercrime. Furthermore, LLMs significantly benefits malware authors, particularly ransomware gangs, in generating sophisticated variants of wiper and ransomware attacks with ease. On a positive note, our study also highlights how offensive security researchers and pentesters can make use of LLMs to simulate realistic attack scenarios, identify potential vulnerabilities, and better protect organizations. Overall, we conclude by emphasizing the need for increased vigilance in mitigating the risks associated with LLMs. This includes implementing robust security measures, increasing awareness and education around the potential risks of this technology, and collaborating with security experts to stay ahead of emerging threats.

- *Hsinlin Tan*

> Vehicle technology has developed rapidly these years, however, the security measures for in-vehicle network does not keep up with the trend. Controller area network(CAN) is the most used protocol in the in-vehicle network. With the characteristic of CAN, there exists many vulnerabilities including lacks of integrity and confidentiality, and hence CAN is vulnerable to various attacks such as impersonation attack, replay attack, etc. In order to implement the authentication and encryption, secret key derivation is necessary. In this work, we proposed an efficient key management scheme for in-vehicle network. In particular, the scheme has five phases. In the first and second phase, we utilize elliptic curve cryptography-based key encapsulation mechanism(KEM) to derive a pairwise secret between each ECU and a central secure ECU in the same group. Then in the third phase, we design secure communication to derive group shared secret among all ECU in a group. In the last two phases, SECU is not needed, regular ECU can derive session key on their own. We presented a possible attack analysis(chosen-ciphertext attack as the main threat) and a security property analysis for our scheme. Our scheme is evaluated based on a hardware-based experiment of three different microcontrollers and a software-based simulation of IVNS. We argue that based on our estimation and the experiment result, our scheme performs better in communication and computation overhead than similar works.

- `2305.15594v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15594v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15594v1)

> Large language models (LLMs) are excellent in-context learners. However, the sensitivity of data contained in prompts raises privacy concerns. Our work first shows that these concerns are valid: we instantiate a simple but highly effective membership inference attack against the data used to prompt LLMs. To address this vulnerability, one could forego prompting and resort to fine-tuning LLMs with known algorithms for private gradient descent. However, this comes at the expense of the practicality and efficiency offered by prompting. Therefore, we propose to privately learn to prompt. We first show that soft prompts can be obtained privately through gradient descent on downstream data. However, this is not the case for discrete prompts. Thus, we orchestrate a noisy vote among an ensemble of LLMs presented with different prompts, i.e., a flock of stochastic parrots. The vote privately transfers the flock's knowledge into a single public prompt. We show that LLMs prompted with our private algorithms closely match the non-private baselines. For example, using GPT3 as the base model, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 92.7% on the sst2 dataset with ($\epsilon=0.147, \delta=10^{-6}$)-differential privacy vs. 95.2% for the non-private baseline. Through our experiments, we also show that our prompt-based approach is easily deployed with existing commercial APIs.

> Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in smart contracts is crucial, especially considering the rapid growth and increasing complexity of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms. To address the challenges associated with securing these contracts, we introduce a versatile dynamic analysis framework specifically designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This comprehensive framework focuses on tracking contract executions, capturing valuable runtime information, while introducing and employing the Execution Property Graph (EPG) to propose a unique graph traversal technique that swiftly detects potential smart contract attacks. Our approach showcases its efficacy with rapid average graph traversal time per transaction and high true positive rates. The successful identification of a zero-day vulnerability affecting Uniswap highlights the framework's potential to effectively uncover smart contract vulnerabilities in complex DeFi systems.

> The research explores the influence of preschool attendance (one year before full-time school) on the development of children during their first year of school. Using data collected by the Australian Early Development Census, the findings show that areas with high proportions of preschool attendance tended to have lower proportions of children with at least one developmental vulnerability. Developmental vulnerablities include not being able to cope with the school day (tired, hungry, low energy), unable to get along with others or aggressive behaviour, trouble with reading/writing or numbers. These findings, of course, vary by region. Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning, the researchers were able to identify three distinct clusters within Queensland, each characterised by different socio-demographic variables influencing the relationship between preschool attendance and developmental vulnerability. These analyses contribute to understanding regions with high vulnerability and the potential need for tailored policies or investments

> Many Machine Learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: There exist methodologies that add a small (imperceptible) perturbation to an input such that the model comes up with a wrong prediction. Better understanding of such attacks is crucial in particular for models used in security-critical domains, such as monitoring of water distribution networks, in order to devise counter-measures enhancing model robustness and trustworthiness.   We propose a taxonomy for adversarial attacks against machine learning based leakage detectors in water distribution networks. Following up on this, we focus on a particular type of attack: an adversary searching the least sensitive point, that is, the location in the water network where the largest possible undetected leak could occur. Based on a mathematical formalization of the least sensitive point problem, we use three different algorithmic approaches to find a solution. Results are evaluated on two benchmark water distribution networks.

> In open-source projects, anyone can contribute, so it is important to have an active continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline in addition to a protocol for reporting security concerns, especially in projects that are widely used and belong to the software supply chain. Many of these projects are hosted on GitHub, where maintainers can create automated workflows using GitHub Actions, introduced in 2019, for inspecting proposed changes to source code and defining a security policy for reporting vulnerabilities. We conduct an empirical study to measure the usage of GitHub workflows and security policies in thousands of popular repositories based on the number of stars. After querying the top one-hundred and top one-thousand repositories from all 181 trending GitHub topics, and the top 4,900 overall repositories, totaling just over 173 thousand projects, we find that 37% of projects have workflows enabled and 7% have a security policy in place. Using the top 60 repositories from each of the 34 most popular programming languages on GitHub, 2,040 projects total, we find that 57% of projects have workflows enabled and 17% have a security policy in place. Furthermore, from those top repositories that have support for GitHub CodeQL static analysis, which performs bug and vulnerability checks, only 13.5% have it enabled; in fact, we find that only 1.7% of the top repositories using Kotlin have an active CodeQL scanning workflow. These results highlight that open-source project maintainers should prioritize configuring workflows, enabling automated static analysis whenever possible, and defining a security policy to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced or remaining in source code.

> The advent of automation in particular Software Engineering (SE) tasks has transitioned from theory to reality. Numerous scholarly articles have documented the successful application of Artificial Intelligence to address issues in areas such as project management, modeling, testing, and development. A recent innovation is the introduction of ChatGPT, an ML-infused chatbot, touted as a resource proficient in generating programming codes and formulating software testing strategies for developers and testers respectively. Although there is speculation that AI-based computation can increase productivity and even substitute software engineers in software development, there is currently a lack of empirical evidence to verify this. Moreover, despite the primary focus on enhancing the accuracy of AI systems, non-functional requirements including energy efficiency, vulnerability, fairness (i.e., human bias), and safety frequently receive insufficient attention. This paper posits that a comprehensive comparison of software engineers and AI-based solutions, considering various evaluation criteria, is pivotal in fostering human-machine collaboration, enhancing the reliability of AI-based methods, and understanding task suitability for humans or AI. Furthermore, it facilitates the effective implementation of cooperative work structures and human-in-the-loop processes. This paper conducts an empirical investigation, contrasting the performance of software engineers and AI systems, like ChatGPT, across different evaluation metrics. The empirical study includes a case of assessing ChatGPT-generated code versus code produced by developers and uploaded in Leetcode.

> Blockchain provides the unique and accountable channel for financial forensics by mining its open and immutable transaction data. A recent surge has been witnessed by training machine learning models with cryptocurrency transaction data for anomaly detection, such as money laundering and other fraudulent activities. This paper presents a holistic applied data science approach to fraud detection in the Bitcoin network with two original contributions. First, we contribute the Elliptic++ dataset, which extends the Elliptic transaction dataset to include over 822k Bitcoin wallet addresses (nodes), each with 56 features, and 1.27M temporal interactions. This enables both the detection of fraudulent transactions and the detection of illicit addresses (actors) in the Bitcoin network by leveraging four types of graph data: (i) the transaction-to-transaction graph, representing the money flow in the Bitcoin network, (ii) the address-to-address interaction graph, capturing the types of transaction flows between Bitcoin addresses, (iii) the address-transaction graph, representing the bi-directional money flow between addresses and transactions (BTC flow from input address to one or more transactions and BTC flow from a transaction to one or more output addresses), and (iv) the user entity graph, capturing clusters of Bitcoin addresses representing unique Bitcoin users. Second, we perform fraud detection tasks on all four graphs by using diverse machine learning algorithms. We show that adding enhanced features from the address-to-address and the address-transaction graphs not only assists in effectively detecting both illicit transactions and illicit addresses, but also assists in gaining in-depth understanding of the root cause of money laundering vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency transactions and the strategies for fraud detection and prevention.

> A growing literature on human-AI decision-making investigates strategies for combining human judgment with statistical models to improve decision-making. Research in this area often evaluates proposed improvements to models, interfaces, or workflows by demonstrating improved predictive performance on "ground truth" labels. However, this practice overlooks a key difference between human judgments and model predictions. Whereas humans reason about broader phenomena of interest in a decision -- including latent constructs that are not directly observable, such as disease status, the "toxicity" of online comments, or future "job performance" -- predictive models target proxy labels that are readily available in existing datasets. Predictive models' reliance on simplistic proxies makes them vulnerable to various sources of statistical bias. In this paper, we identify five sources of target variable bias that can impact the validity of proxy labels in human-AI decision-making tasks. We develop a causal framework to disentangle the relationship between each bias and clarify which are of concern in specific human-AI decision-making tasks. We demonstrate how our framework can be used to articulate implicit assumptions made in prior modeling work, and we recommend evaluation strategies for verifying whether these assumptions hold in practice. We then leverage our framework to re-examine the designs of prior human subjects experiments that investigate human-AI decision-making, finding that only a small fraction of studies examine factors related to target variable bias. We conclude by discussing opportunities to better address target variable bias in future research.

> Backdoor attacks are an insidious security threat against machine learning models. Adversaries can manipulate the predictions of compromised models by inserting triggers into the training phase. Various backdoor attacks have been devised which can achieve nearly perfect attack success without affecting model predictions for clean inputs. Means of mitigating such vulnerabilities are underdeveloped, especially in natural language processing. To fill this gap, we introduce IMBERT, which uses either gradients or self-attention scores derived from victim models to self-defend against backdoor attacks at inference time. Our empirical studies demonstrate that IMBERT can effectively identify up to 98.5% of inserted triggers. Thus, it significantly reduces the attack success rate while attaining competitive accuracy on the clean dataset across widespread insertion-based attacks compared to two baselines. Finally, we show that our approach is model-agnostic, and can be easily ported to several pre-trained transformer models.

> Deep learning (DL) models have become increasingly popular in identifying software vulnerabilities. Prior studies found that vulnerabilities across different vulnerable programs may exhibit similar vulnerable scopes, implicitly forming discernible vulnerability patterns that can be learned by DL models through supervised training. However, vulnerable scopes still manifest in various spatial locations and formats within a program, posing challenges for models to accurately identify vulnerable statements. Despite this challenge, state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches fail to exploit the vulnerability patterns that arise in vulnerable programs. To take full advantage of vulnerability patterns and unleash the ability of DL models, we propose a novel vulnerability-matching approach in this paper, drawing inspiration from program analysis tools that locate vulnerabilities based on pre-defined patterns. Specifically, a vulnerability codebook is learned, which consists of quantized vectors representing various vulnerability patterns. During inference, the codebook is iterated to match all learned patterns and predict the presence of potential vulnerabilities within a given program. Our approach was extensively evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising more than 188,000 C/C++ functions. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves an F1-score of 94% (6% higher than the previous best) and 82% (19% higher than the previous best) for function and statement-level vulnerability identification, respectively. These substantial enhancements highlight the effectiveness of our approach to identifying vulnerabilities.

> Many ML-based approaches have been proposed to automatically detect, localize, and repair software vulnerabilities. While ML-based methods are more effective than program analysis-based vulnerability analysis tools, few have been integrated into modern IDEs, hindering practical adoption. To bridge this critical gap, we propose AIBugHunter, a novel ML-based software vulnerability analysis tool for C/C++ languages that is integrated into Visual Studio Code. AIBugHunter helps software developers to achieve real-time vulnerability detection, explanation, and repairs during programming. In particular, AIBugHunter scans through developers' source code to (1) locate vulnerabilities, (2) identify vulnerability types, (3) estimate vulnerability severity, and (4) suggest vulnerability repairs. In this article, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization (MOO)-based vulnerability classification approach and a transformer-based estimation approach to help AIBugHunter accurately identify vulnerability types and estimate severity. Our empirical experiments on a large dataset consisting of 188K+ C/C++ functions confirm that our proposed approaches are more accurate than other state-of-the-art baseline methods for vulnerability classification and estimation. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative evaluations including a survey study and a user study to obtain software practitioners' perceptions of our AIBugHunter tool and assess the impact that AIBugHunter may have on developers' productivity in security aspects. Our survey study shows that our AIBugHunter is perceived as useful where 90% of the participants consider adopting our AIBugHunter. Last but not least, our user study shows that our AIBugHunter could possibly enhance developers' productivity in combating cybersecurity issues during software development.

> Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we consider the scenario where a model is distributed to multiple buyers, among which a malicious buyer attempts to attack another buyer. The malicious buyer probes its copy of the model to search for adversarial samples and then presents the found samples to the victim's copy of the model in order to replicate the attack. We point out that by distributing different copies of the model to different buyers, we can mitigate the attack such that adversarial samples found on one copy would not work on another copy. We observed that training a model with different randomness indeed mitigates such replication to a certain degree. However, there is no guarantee and retraining is computationally expensive. A number of works extended the retraining method to enhance the differences among models. However, a very limited number of models can be produced using such methods and the computational cost becomes even higher. Therefore, we propose a flexible parameter rewriting method that directly modifies the model's parameters. This method does not require additional training and is able to generate a large number of copies in a more controllable manner, where each copy induces different adversarial regions. Experimentation studies show that rewriting can significantly mitigate the attacks while retaining high classification accuracy. For instance, on GTSRB dataset with respect to Hop Skip Jump attack, using attractor-based rewriter can reduce the success rate of replicating the attack to 0.5% while independently training copies with different randomness can reduce the success rate to 6.5%. From this study, we believe that there are many further directions worth exploring.

> The Global Wearable market is anticipated to rise at a considerable rate in the next coming years and communication is a fundamental block in any wearable device. In communication, encryption methods are being used with the aid of microcontrollers or software implementations, which are power-consuming and incorporate complex hardware implementation. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are considered as resource-constrained devices that are expected to operate with low computational power and resource utilization criteria. At the same time, recent research has shown that IoT devices are highly vulnerable to emerging security threats, which elevates the need for low-power and small-size hardware-based security countermeasures. Chaotic encryption is a method of data encryption that utilizes chaotic systems and non-linear dynamics to generate secure encryption keys. It aims to provide high-level security by creating encryption keys that are sensitive to initial conditions and difficult to predict, making it challenging for unauthorized parties to intercept and decode encrypted data. Since the discovery of chaotic equations, there have been various encryption applications associated with them. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the physical and encryption attacks on continuous chaotic systems in resource-constrained devices and their potential remedies. To this aim, we introduce different categories of attacks of chaotic encryption. Our experiments focus on chaotic equations implemented using Chua's equation and leverages circuit architectures and provide simulations proof of remedies for different attacks. These remedies are provided to block the attackers from stealing users' information (e.g., a pulse message) with negligible cost to the power and area of the design.

> Split learning is a collaborative learning design that allows several participants (clients) to train a shared model while keeping their datasets private. Recent studies demonstrate that collaborative learning models, specifically federated learning, are vulnerable to security and privacy attacks such as model inference and backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are a group of poisoning attacks in which the attacker tries to control the model output by manipulating the model's training process. While there have been studies regarding inference attacks on split learning, it has not yet been tested for backdoor attacks. This paper performs a novel backdoor attack on split learning and studies its effectiveness. Despite traditional backdoor attacks done on the client side, we inject the backdoor trigger from the server side. For this purpose, we provide two attack methods: one using a surrogate client and another using an autoencoder to poison the model via incoming smashed data and its outgoing gradient toward the innocent participants. We did our experiments using three model architectures and three publicly available datasets in the image domain and ran a total of 761 experiments to evaluate our attack methods. The results show that despite using strong patterns and injection methods, split learning is highly robust and resistant to such poisoning attacks. While we get the attack success rate of 100% as our best result for the MNIST dataset, in most of the other cases, our attack shows little success when increasing the cut layer.

> Despite recent advancements, NLP models continue to be vulnerable to bias. This bias often originates from the uneven distribution of real-world data and can propagate through the annotation process. Escalated integration of these models in our lives calls for methods to mitigate bias without overbearing annotation costs. While active learning (AL) has shown promise in training models with a small amount of annotated data, AL's reliance on the model's behavior for selective sampling can lead to an accumulation of unwanted bias rather than bias mitigation. However, infusing clustering with AL can overcome the bias issue of both AL and traditional annotation methods while exploiting AL's annotation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive clustering-based active learning algorithm, D-CALM, that dynamically adjusts clustering and annotation efforts in response to an estimated classifier error-rate. Experiments on eight datasets for a diverse set of text classification tasks, including emotion, hatespeech, dialog act, and book type detection, demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline AL approaches with both pretrained transformers and traditional Support Vector Machines. D-CALM showcases robustness against different measures of information gain and, as evident from our analysis of label and error distribution, can significantly reduce unwanted model bias.

> Effective unit tests can help guard and improve software quality but require a substantial amount of time and effort to write and maintain. A unit test consists of a test prefix and a test oracle. Synthesizing test oracles, especially functional oracles, is a well-known challenging problem. Recent studies proposed to leverage neural models to generate test oracles, i.e., neural test oracle generation (NTOG), and obtained promising results. However, after a systematic inspection, we find there are some inappropriate settings in existing evaluation methods for NTOG. These settings could mislead the understanding of existing NTOG approaches' performance. We summarize them as 1) generating test prefixes from bug-fixed program versions, 2) evaluating with an unrealistic metric, and 3) lacking a straightforward baseline. In this paper, we first investigate the impacts of these settings on evaluating and understanding the performance of NTOG approaches. We find that 1) unrealistically generating test prefixes from bug-fixed program versions inflates the number of bugs found by the state-of-the-art NTOG approach TOGA by 61.8%, 2) FPR (False Positive Rate) is not a realistic evaluation metric and the Precision of TOGA is only 0.38%, and 3) a straightforward baseline NoException, which simply expects no exception should be raised, can find 61% of the bugs found by TOGA with twice the Precision. Furthermore, we introduce an additional ranking step to existing evaluation methods and propose an evaluation metric named Found@K to better measure the cost-effectiveness of NTOG approaches. We propose a novel unsupervised ranking method to instantiate this ranking step, significantly improving the cost-effectiveness of TOGA. Eventually, we propose a more realistic evaluation method TEval+ for NTOG and summarize seven rules of thumb to boost NTOG approaches into their practical usages.

> Federated Learning, as a popular paradigm for collaborative training, is vulnerable against privacy attacks. Different privacy levels regarding users' attitudes need to be satisfied locally, while a strict privacy guarantee for the global model is also required centrally. Personalized Local Differential Privacy (PLDP) is suitable for preserving users' varying local privacy, yet only provides a central privacy guarantee equivalent to the worst-case local privacy level. Thus, achieving strong central privacy as well as personalized local privacy with a utility-promising model is a challenging problem. In this work, a general framework (APES) is built up to strengthen model privacy under personalized local privacy by leveraging the privacy amplification effect of the shuffle model. To tighten the privacy bound, we quantify the heterogeneous contributions to the central privacy user by user. The contributions are characterized by the ability of generating "echos" from the perturbation of each user, which is carefully measured by proposed methods Neighbor Divergence and Clip-Laplace Mechanism. Furthermore, we propose a refined framework (S-APES) with the post-sparsification technique to reduce privacy loss in high-dimension scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of shuffling on personalized local privacy is considered for the first time. We provide a strong privacy amplification effect, and the bound is tighter than the baseline result based on existing methods for uniform local privacy. Experiments demonstrate that our frameworks ensure comparable or higher accuracy for the global model.

> Roof type is one of the most critical building characteristics for wind vulnerability modeling. It is also the most frequently missing building feature from publicly available databases. An automatic roof classification framework is developed herein to generate high-resolution roof-type data using machine learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to classify roof types using building-level satellite images. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.96 on predicting roof types for 1,000 test buildings. The CNN model was then used to predict roof types for 161,772 single-family houses in New Hanover County, NC, and Miami-Dade County, FL. The distribution of roof type in city and census tract scales was presented. A high variance was observed in the dominant roof type among census tracts. To improve the completeness of the roof-type data, imputation algorithms were developed to populate missing roof data due to low-quality images, using critical building attributes and neighborhood-level roof characteristics.

- *Simone Bombari, Shayan Kiyani, Marco Mondelli*

- `2302.01629v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01629v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01629v2)

> Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and a thought-provoking paper by Bubeck and Sellke has analyzed this phenomenon through the lens of over-parameterization: interpolating smoothly the data requires significantly more parameters than simply memorizing it. However, this "universal" law provides only a necessary condition for robustness, and it is unable to discriminate between models. In this paper, we address these gaps by focusing on empirical risk minimization in two prototypical settings, namely, random features and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). We prove that, for random features, the model is not robust for any degree of over-parameterization, even when the necessary condition coming from the universal law of robustness is satisfied. In contrast, for even activations, the NTK model meets the universal lower bound, and it is robust as soon as the necessary condition on over-parameterization is fulfilled. This also addresses a conjecture in prior work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj. Our analysis decouples the effect of the kernel of the model from an "interaction matrix", which describes the interaction with the test data and captures the effect of the activation. Our theoretical results are corroborated by numerical evidence on both synthetic and standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).

> Object detection is a critical component of various security-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving and video surveillance. However, existing deep learning-based object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which poses a significant challenge to their reliability and safety. Through experiments, we found that existing works on improving the adversarial robustness of object detectors have given a false sense of security. We argue that using adversarially pre-trained backbone networks is essential for enhancing the adversarial robustness of object detectors. We propose a simple yet effective recipe for fast adversarial fine-tuning on object detectors with adversarially pre-trained backbones. Without any modifications to the structure of object detectors, our recipe achieved significantly better adversarial robustness than previous works. Moreover, we explore the potential of different modern object detectors to improve adversarial robustness using our recipe and demonstrate several interesting findings. Our empirical results set a new milestone and deepen the understanding of adversarially robust object detection. Code and trained checkpoints will be publicly available.

> Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been widely used to underpin various downstream tasks. However, the adversarial attack task has found that PLMs are vulnerable to small perturbations. Mainstream methods adopt a detached two-stage framework to attack without considering the subsequent influence of substitution at each step. In this paper, we formally model the adversarial attack task on PLMs as a sequential decision-making problem, where the whole attack process is sequential with two decision-making problems, i.e., word finder and word substitution. Considering the attack process can only receive the final state without any direct intermediate signals, we propose to use reinforcement learning to find an appropriate sequential attack path to generate adversaries, named SDM-Attack. Extensive experimental results show that SDM-Attack achieves the highest attack success rate with a comparable modification rate and semantic similarity to attack fine-tuned BERT. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate the generalization and transferability of SDM-Attack. The code is available at https://github.com/fduxuan/SDM-Attack.

> Analog compute-in-memory (CIM) systems are promising for deep neural network (DNN) inference acceleration due to their energy efficiency and high throughput. However, as the use of DNNs expands, protecting user input privacy has become increasingly important. In this paper, we identify a potential security vulnerability wherein an adversary can reconstruct the user's private input data from a power side-channel attack, under proper data acquisition and pre-processing, even without knowledge of the DNN model. We further demonstrate a machine learning-based attack approach using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance the data reconstruction. Our results show that the attack methodology is effective in reconstructing user inputs from analog CIM accelerator power leakage, even at large noise levels and after countermeasures are applied. Specifically, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on an example of U-Net inference chip for brain tumor detection, and show the original magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) medical images can be successfully reconstructed even at a noise-level of 20% standard deviation of the maximum power signal value. Our study highlights a potential security vulnerability in analog CIM accelerators and raises awareness of using GAN to breach user privacy in such systems.

> Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of acoustics-enabled personal devices powered by machine learning. Yet, machine learning has proven to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. A large number of modern systems protect themselves against such attacks by targeting artificiality, i.e., they deploy mechanisms to detect the lack of human involvement in generating the adversarial examples. However, these defenses implicitly assume that humans are incapable of producing meaningful and targeted adversarial examples. In this paper, we show that this base assumption is wrong. In particular, we demonstrate that for tasks like speaker identification, a human is capable of producing analog adversarial examples directly with little cost and supervision: by simply speaking through a tube, an adversary reliably impersonates other speakers in eyes of ML models for speaker identification. Our findings extend to a range of other acoustic-biometric tasks such as liveness detection, bringing into question their use in security-critical settings in real life, such as phone banking.

> Large amounts of incremental learning algorithms have been proposed to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue arises while dealing with sequential data on a time series. However, the adversarial robustness of incremental learners has not been widely verified, leaving potential security risks. Specifically, for poisoning-based backdoor attacks, we argue that the nature of streaming data in IL provides great convenience to the adversary by creating the possibility of distributed and cross-task attacks -- an adversary can affect \textbf{any unknown} previous or subsequent task by data poisoning \textbf{at any time or time series} with extremely small amount of backdoor samples injected (e.g., $0.1\%$ based on our observations). To attract the attention of the research community, in this paper, we empirically reveal the high vulnerability of 11 typical incremental learners against poisoning-based backdoor attack on 3 learning scenarios, especially the cross-task generalization effect of backdoor knowledge, while the poison ratios range from $5\%$ to as low as $0.1\%$. Finally, the defense mechanism based on activation clustering is found to be effective in detecting our trigger pattern to mitigate potential security risks.

> Recent works found that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be fooled by adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding adversarial noise on clean inputs. The accuracy of DNNs on adversarial examples will decrease as the magnitude of the adversarial noise increase. In this study, we show that DNNs can be also fooled when the noise is very small under certain circumstances. This new type of attack is called Amplification Trojan Attack (ATAttack). Specifically, we use a trojan network to transform the inputs before sending them to the target DNN. This trojan network serves as an amplifier to amplify the inherent weakness of the target DNN. The target DNN, which is infected by the trojan network, performs normally on clean data while being more vulnerable to adversarial examples. Since it only transforms the inputs, the trojan network can hide in DNN-based pipelines, e.g. by infecting the pre-processing procedure of the inputs before sending them to the DNNs. This new type of threat should be considered in developing safe DNNs.

> Randomized ensemble classifiers (RECs), where one classifier is randomly selected during inference, have emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional ensembling methods for realizing adversarially robust classifiers with limited compute requirements. However, recent works have shown that existing methods for constructing RECs are more vulnerable than initially claimed, casting major doubts on their efficacy and prompting fundamental questions such as: "When are RECs useful?", "What are their limits?", and "How do we train them?". In this work, we first demystify RECs as we derive fundamental results regarding their theoretical limits, necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be useful, and more. Leveraging this new understanding, we propose a new boosting algorithm (BARRE) for training robust RECs, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness at defending against strong $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded adversaries across various network architectures and datasets. Our code can be found at https://github.com/hsndbk4/BARRE.

> Decision Support Systems for pavement and maintenance strategies have traditionally been designed as silos led to local optimum systems. Moreover, since big data usage didn't exist as result of Industry 4.0 as of today, DSSs were not initially designed adaptive to the sources of uncertainties led to rigid decisions. Motivated by the vulnerability of the road assets to the climate phenomena, this paper takes a visionary step towards introducing a Technology-Driven Adaptive Decision Support System for Integrated Pavement and Maintenance activities called TDADSS-IPM. As part of such DSS, a bottom-up risk assessment model is met via Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to realize the actual condition of the Danish roads due to weather condition. Such model fills the gaps in the knowledge domain and develops a platform that can be trained over time, and applied in real-time to the actual event.

> Prompt-based learning is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks against prompt-based models consider injecting backdoors into the entire embedding layers or word embedding vectors. Such attacks can be easily affected by retraining on downstream tasks and with different prompting strategies, limiting the transferability of backdoor attacks. In this work, we propose transferable backdoor attacks against prompt-based models, called NOTABLE, which is independent of downstream tasks and prompting strategies. Specifically, NOTABLE injects backdoors into the encoders of PLMs by utilizing an adaptive verbalizer to bind triggers to specific words (i.e., anchors). It activates the backdoor by pasting input with triggers to reach adversary-desired anchors, achieving independence from downstream tasks and prompting strategies. We conduct experiments on six NLP tasks, three popular models, and three prompting strategies. Empirical results show that NOTABLE achieves superior attack performance (i.e., attack success rate over 90% on all the datasets), and outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines. Evaluations on three defenses show the robustness of NOTABLE. Our code can be found at https://github.com/RU-System-Software-and-Security/Notable.

> The use of third-party packages is becoming increasingly popular and has led to the emergence of large software package ecosystems with a maze of inter-dependencies. Since the reliance on these ecosystems enables developers to reduce development effort and increase productivity, it has attracted the interest of researchers: understanding the infrastructure and dynamics of package ecosystems has given rise to approaches for better code reuse, automated updates, and the avoidance of vulnerabilities, to name a few examples. But the reality of these ecosystems also poses challenges to software engineering researchers, such as: How do we obtain the complete network of dependencies along with the corresponding versioning information? What are the boundaries of these package ecosystems? How do we consistently detect dependencies that are declared but not used? How do we consistently identify developers within a package ecosystem? How much of the ecosystem do we need to understand to analyse a single component? How well do our approaches generalise across different programming languages and package ecosystems? In this chapter, we review promises and perils of mining the rich data related to software package ecosystems available to software engineering researchers.

> Graph neural network (GNN) with a powerful representation capability has been widely applied to various areas, such as biological gene prediction, social recommendation, etc. Recent works have exposed that GNN is vulnerable to the backdoor attack, i.e., models trained with maliciously crafted training samples are easily fooled by patched samples. Most of the proposed studies launch the backdoor attack using a trigger that either is the randomly generated subgraph (e.g., erd\H{o}s-r\'enyi backdoor) for less computational burden, or the gradient-based generative subgraph (e.g., graph trojaning attack) to enable a more effective attack. However, the interpretation of how is the trigger structure and the effect of the backdoor attack related has been overlooked in the current literature. Motifs, recurrent and statistically significant sub-graphs in graphs, contain rich structure information. In this paper, we are rethinking the trigger from the perspective of motifs, and propose a motif-based backdoor attack, denoted as Motif-Backdoor. It contributes from three aspects. (i) Interpretation: it provides an in-depth explanation for backdoor effectiveness by the validity of the trigger structure from motifs, leading to some novel insights, e.g., using subgraphs that appear less frequently in the graph as the trigger can achieve better attack performance. (ii) Effectiveness: Motif-Backdoor reaches the state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack performance in both black-box and defensive scenarios. (iii) Efficiency: based on the graph motif distribution, Motif-Backdoor can quickly obtain an effective trigger structure without target model feedback or subgraph model generation. Extensive experimental results show that Motif-Backdoor realizes the SOTA performance on three popular models and four public datasets compared with five baselines.

> RowHammer (RH) is a significant and worsening security, safety, and reliability issue of modern DRAM chips that can be exploited to break memory isolation. Therefore, it is important to understand real DRAM chips' RH characteristics. Unfortunately, no prior work extensively studies the RH vulnerability of modern 3D-stacked high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are commonly used in modern GPUs.   In this work, we experimentally characterize the RH vulnerability of a real HBM2 DRAM chip. We show that 1) different 3D-stacked channels of HBM2 memory exhibit significantly different levels of RH vulnerability (up to 79% difference in bit error rate), 2) the DRAM rows at the end of a DRAM bank (rows with the highest addresses) exhibit significantly fewer RH bitflips than other rows, and 3) a modern HBM2 DRAM chip implements undisclosed RH defenses that are triggered by periodic refresh operations. We describe the implications of our observations on future RH attacks and defenses and discuss future work for understanding RH in 3D-stacked memories.

OpenAI developed ChatGPT blizzard on the Internet as it crossed one million users within five days of its launch. However, with the enhanced popularity, chatbots experienced cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. This paper discussed the relevant literature, reports, and explanatory incident attacks generated against chatbots. Our initial point is to explore the timeline of chatbots from ELIZA (an early natural language processing computer program) to GPT-4 and provide the working mechanism of ChatGPT. Subsequently, we explored the cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities in chatbots. Besides, we investigated the ChatGPT, specifically in the context of creating the malware code, phishing emails, undetectable zero-day attacks, and generation of macros and LOLBINs. Furthermore, the history of cyberattacks and vulnerabilities exploited by cybercriminals are discussed, particularly considering the risk and vulnerabilities in ChatGPT. Addressing these threats and vulnerabilities requires specific strategies and measures to reduce the harmful consequences. Therefore, the future directions to address the challenges were presented.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming a key component in diverse systems across the board. However, despite their success, they often err miserably; and this has triggered significant interest in formally verifying them. Unfortunately, DNN verifiers are intricate tools, and are themselves susceptible to soundness bugs. Due to the complexity of DNN verifiers, as well as the sizes of the DNNs being verified, debugging such errors is a daunting task. Here, we present a novel tool, named DelBugV, that uses automated delta debugging techniques on DNN verifiers. Given a malfunctioning DNN verifier and a correct verifier as a point of reference (or, in some cases, just a single, malfunctioning verifier), DelBugV can produce much simpler DNN verification instances that still trigger undesired behavior -- greatly facilitating the task of debugging the faulty verifier. Our tool is modular and extensible, and can easily be enhanced with additional network simplification methods and strategies. For evaluation purposes, we ran DelBugV on 4 DNN verification engines, which were observed to produce incorrect results at the 2021 neural network verification competition (VNN-COMP'21). We were able to simplify many of the verification queries that trigger these faulty behaviors, by as much as 99%. We regard our work as a step towards the ultimate goal of producing reliable and trustworthy DNN-based software.

> The advent of social media has given rise to numerous ethical challenges, with hate speech among the most significant concerns. Researchers are attempting to tackle this problem by leveraging hate-speech detection and employing language models to automatically moderate content and promote civil discourse. Unfortunately, recent studies have revealed that hate-speech detection systems can be misled by adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their resilience. While previous research has separately addressed the robustness of these models under adversarial attacks and their interpretability, there has been no comprehensive study exploring their intersection. The novelty of our work lies in combining these two critical aspects, leveraging interpretability to identify potential vulnerabilities and enabling the design of targeted adversarial attacks. We present a comprehensive and comparative analysis of adversarial robustness exhibited by various hate-speech detection models. Our study evaluates the resilience of these models against adversarial attacks using explainability techniques. To gain insights into the models' decision-making processes, we employ the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework. Based on the explainability results obtained by LIME, we devise and execute targeted attacks on the text by leveraging the TextAttack tool. Our findings enhance the understanding of the vulnerabilities and strengths exhibited by state-of-the-art hate-speech detection models. This work underscores the importance of incorporating explainability in the development and evaluation of such models to enhance their resilience against adversarial attacks. Ultimately, this work paves the way for creating more robust and reliable hate-speech detection systems, fostering safer online environments and promoting ethical discourse on social media platforms.

> Multiple approaches have been proposed to automatically recommend potential developers who can address bug reports. These approaches are typically designed to work for any bug report submitted to any software project. However, we conjecture that these approaches may not work equally well for all the reports in a project. We conducted an empirical study to validate this conjecture, using three bug assignment approaches applied on 2,249 bug reports from two open source systems. We found empirical evidence that validates our conjecture, which led us to explore the idea of identifying and applying the best-performing approach for each bug report to obtain more accurate developer recommendations. We conducted an additional study to assess the feasibility of this idea using machine learning. While we found a wide margin of accuracy improvement for this approach, it is far from achieving the maximum possible improvement and performs comparably to baseline approaches. We discuss potential reasons for these results and conjecture that the assignment approaches may not capture important information about the bug assignment process that developers perform in practice. The results warrant future research in understanding how developers assign bug reports and improving automated bug report assignment

> Increased dependence of the maritime industry on information and communication networks has made shipboard power systems vulnerable to stealthy cyber-attacks. One such attack variant, called rootkit, can leverage system knowledge to hide its presence and allow remotely located malware handlers to gain complete control of infected subsystems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the threat landscape imposed by such attack variants on Medium Voltage DC (MVDC) shipboard microgrids, including a discussion of their impact on the overall maritime sector in general, and provides several simulation results to demonstrate the same. It also analyzes and presents the actions of possible defense mechanisms, with specific emphasis on evasion, deception, and detection frameworks, that will help ship operators and maritime cybersecurity professionals protect their systems from such attacks.

> Diffusion-based generative models have shown great potential for image synthesis, but there is a lack of research on the security and privacy risks they may pose. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of diffusion models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), a common privacy concern. Our results indicate that existing MIAs designed for GANs or VAE are largely ineffective on diffusion models, either due to inapplicable scenarios (e.g., requiring the discriminator of GANs) or inappropriate assumptions (e.g., closer distances between synthetic samples and member samples). To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a query-based MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with hold-out samples. We consider both the standard diffusion models, e.g., DDPM, and the text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Latent Diffusion Models and Stable Diffusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods precisely infer the membership with high confidence on both of the two scenarios across multiple different datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/SecMI.

> Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly pervasive and essential components in enabling new applications and services. However, their widespread use also exposes them to exploitable vulnerabilities and flaws that can lead to significant losses. In this context, ensuring robust cybersecurity measures is essential to protect IoT devices from malicious attacks. However, the current solutions that provide flexible policy specifications and higher security levels for IoT devices are scarce. To address this gap, we introduce T800, a low-resource packet filter that utilizes machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify packets in IoT devices. We present a detailed performance benchmarking framework and demonstrate T800's effectiveness on the ESP32 system-on-chip microcontroller and ESP-IDF framework. Our evaluation shows that T800 is an efficient solution that increases device computational capacity by excluding unsolicited malicious traffic from the processing pipeline. Additionally, T800 is adaptable to different systems and provides a well-documented performance evaluation strategy for security ML-based mechanisms on ESP32-based IoT systems. Our research contributes to improving the cybersecurity of resource-constrained IoT devices and provides a scalable, efficient solution that can be used to enhance the security of IoT systems.

> Machine learning models that are overfitted/overtrained are more vulnerable to knowledge leakage, which poses a risk to privacy. Suppose we download or receive a model from a third-party collaborator without knowing its training accuracy. How can we determine if it has been overfitted or overtrained on its training data? It's possible that the model was intentionally over-trained to make it vulnerable during testing. While an overfitted or overtrained model may perform well on testing data and even some generalization tests, we can't be sure it's not over-fitted. Conducting a comprehensive generalization test is also expensive. The goal of this paper is to address these issues and ensure the privacy and generalization of our method using only testing data. To achieve this, we analyze the null space in the last layer of neural networks, which enables us to quantify overfitting without access to training data or knowledge of the accuracy of those data. We evaluated our approach on various architectures and datasets and observed a distinct pattern in the angle of null space when models are overfitted. Furthermore, we show that models with poor generalization exhibit specific characteristics in this space. Our work represents the first attempt to quantify overfitting without access to training data or knowing any knowledge about the training samples.

> The software supply chain (SSC) attack has become one of the crucial issues that are being increased rapidly with the advancement of the software development domain. In general, SSC attacks execute during the software development processes lead to vulnerabilities in software products targeting downstream customers and even involved stakeholders. Machine Learning approaches are proven in detecting and preventing software security vulnerabilities. Besides, emerging quantum machine learning can be promising in addressing SSC attacks. Considering the distinction between traditional and quantum machine learning, performance could be varies based on the proportions of the experimenting dataset. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis between quantum neural networks (QNN) and conventional neural networks (NN) with a software supply chain attack dataset known as ClaMP. Our goal is to distinguish the performance between QNN and NN and to conduct the experiment, we develop two different models for QNN and NN by utilizing Pennylane for quantum and TensorFlow and Keras for traditional respectively. We evaluated the performance of both models with different proportions of the ClaMP dataset to identify the f1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy. We also measure the execution time to check the efficiency of both models. The demonstration result indicates that execution time for QNN is slower than NN with a higher percentage of datasets. Due to recent advancements in QNN, a large level of experiments shall be carried out to understand both models accurately in our future research.

> The burgeoning fields of machine learning (ML) and quantum machine learning (QML) have shown remarkable potential in tackling complex problems across various domains. However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks raises concerns when deploying these systems in security sensitive applications. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of the vulnerability of ML and QML models, specifically conventional neural networks (NN) and quantum neural networks (QNN), to adversarial attacks using a malware dataset. We utilize a software supply chain attack dataset known as ClaMP and develop two distinct models for QNN and NN, employing Pennylane for quantum implementations and TensorFlow and Keras for traditional implementations. Our methodology involves crafting adversarial samples by introducing random noise to a small portion of the dataset and evaluating the impact on the models performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Based on our observations, both ML and QML models exhibit vulnerability to adversarial attacks. While the QNNs accuracy decreases more significantly compared to the NN after the attack, it demonstrates better performance in terms of precision and recall, indicating higher resilience in detecting true positives under adversarial conditions. We also find that adversarial samples crafted for one model type can impair the performance of the other, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms. Our study serves as a foundation for future research focused on enhancing the security and resilience of ML and QML models, particularly QNN, given its recent advancements. A more extensive range of experiments will be conducted to better understand the performance and robustness of both models in the face of adversarial attacks.

> The Chromium open-source project has become a fundamental piece of the Web as we know it today, with multiple vendors offering browsers based on its codebase. One of its most popular features is the possibility of altering or enhancing the browser functionality through third-party programs known as browser extensions. Extensions have access to a wide range of capabilities through the use of APIs exposed by Chromium. The Debugger API -- arguably the most powerful of such APIs -- allows extensions to use the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), a capability-rich tool for debugging and instrumenting the browser. In this paper, we describe several vulnerabilities present in the Debugger API and in the granting of capabilities to extensions that can be used by an attacker to take control of the browser, escalate privileges, and break context isolation. We demonstrate their impact by introducing six attacks that allow an attacker to steal user information, monitor network traffic, modify site permissions (\eg access to camera or microphone), bypass security interstitials without user intervention, and change the browser settings. Our attacks work in all major Chromium-based browsers as they are rooted at the core of the Chromium project. We reported our findings to the Chromium Development Team, who already fixed some of them and are currently working on fixing the remaining ones. We conclude by discussing how questionable design decisions, lack of public specifications, and an overpowered Debugger API have contributed to enabling these attacks, and propose mitigations.

> A central tenet of Federated learning (FL), which trains models without centralizing user data, is privacy. However, previous work has shown that the gradient updates used in FL can leak user information. While the most industrial uses of FL are for text applications (e.g. keystroke prediction), nearly all attacks on FL privacy have focused on simple image classifiers. We propose a novel attack that reveals private user text by deploying malicious parameter vectors, and which succeeds even with mini-batches, multiple users, and long sequences. Unlike previous attacks on FL, the attack exploits characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding, separately extracting tokens and positional embeddings to retrieve high-fidelity text. This work suggests that FL on text, which has historically been resistant to privacy attacks, is far more vulnerable than previously thought.

> For a distributed last-level cache (LLC) in a large multicore chip, the access time to one LLC bank can significantly differ from that to another due to the difference in physical distance. In this paper, we successfully demonstrated a new distance-based side-channel attack by timing the AES decryption operation and extracting part of an AES secret key on an Intel Knights Landing CPU. We introduce several techniques to overcome the challenges of the attack, including the use of multiple attack threads to ensure LLC hits, to detect vulnerable memory locations, and to obtain fine-grained timing of the victim operations. While operating as a covert channel, this attack can reach a bandwidth of 205 kbps with an error rate of only 0.02%. We also observed that the side-channel attack can extract 4 bytes of an AES key with 100% accuracy with only 4000 trial rounds of encryption

> The smart-grid introduces several new data-gathering, communication, and information-sharing capabilities into the electrical system, as well as additional privacy threats, vulnerabilities, and cyber-attacks. In this study, Modbus is regarded as one of the most prevalent interfaces for control systems in power plants. Modern control interfaces are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, posing a risk to the entire energy infrastructure. In order to strengthen resistance to cyber-attacks, this study introduces a test bed for cyber-physical systems that operate in real-time. To investigate the network vulnerabilities of smart power grids, Modbus protocol has been examined combining a real-time power system simulator with a communication system simulator and the effects of the system presented and analyzed. The goal is to detect the vulnerability in Modbus protocol and perform the Man-in-the-middle attack with its impact on the system. This proposed testbed can be evaluated as a research model for vulnerability assessment as well as a tool for evaluating cyber-attacks and enquire into any detection mechanism for safeguarding and defending smart grid systems from a variety of cyberattacks. We present here the preliminary findings on using the testbed to identify a particular MiTM attack and the effects on system performance. Finally, we suggest a cyber security strategy as a solution to address such network vulnerabilities and deploy appropriate countermeasures.

> One of the most significant challenges in the field of software code auditing is the presence of vulnerabilities in software source code. Every year, more and more software flaws are discovered, either internally in proprietary code or publicly disclosed. These flaws are highly likely to be exploited and can lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of service. To create a large-scale machine learning system for function level vulnerability identification, we utilized a sizable dataset of C and C++ open-source code containing millions of functions with potential buffer overflow exploits. We have developed an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on neural network models that learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into an intermediate representation to remove unnecessary components and shorten dependencies. We maintain the semantic and syntactic information using state of the art word embedding algorithms such as GloVe and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into neural networks such as LSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM Autoencoder, word2vec, BERT, and GPT2 to classify the possible vulnerabilities.

We have conducted a comparative analysis between results derived from features containing a minimal text representation and semantic and syntactic information.

> Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning framework wherein a parameter server (PS) and a collection of clients collaboratively train a model via minimizing a global objective. Communication bandwidth is a scarce resource; in each round, the PS aggregates the updates from a subset of clients only. In this paper, we focus on non-convex minimization that is vulnerable to non-uniform and time-varying communication failures between the PS and the clients. Specifically, in each round $t$, the link between the PS and client $i$ is active with probability $p_i^t$, which is $\textit{unknown}$ to both the PS and the clients. This arises when the channel conditions are heterogeneous across clients and are changing over time.   We show that when the $p_i^t$'s are not uniform, $\textit{Federated Average}$ (FedAvg) -- the most widely adopted FL algorithm -- fails to minimize the global objective. Observing this, we propose $\textit{Federated Postponed Broadcast}$ (FedPBC) which is a simple variant of FedAvg. It differs from FedAvg in that the PS postpones broadcasting the global model till the end of each round. We show that FedPBC converges to a stationary point of the original objective. The introduced staleness is mild and there is no noticeable slowdown. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results are provided. On the technical front, postponing the global model broadcasts enables implicit gossiping among the clients with active links at round $t$. Despite $p_i^t$'s are time-varying, we are able to bound the perturbation of the global model dynamics via the techniques of controlling the gossip-type information mixing errors.

> Deep learning models have been used in creating various effective image classification applications. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that seek to misguide the models into predicting incorrect classes. Our study of major adversarial attack models shows that they all specifically target and exploit the neural networking structures in their designs. This understanding makes us develop a hypothesis that most classical machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF), are immune to adversarial attack models because they do not rely on neural network design at all. Our experimental study of classical machine learning models against popular adversarial attacks supports this hypothesis. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a new adversarial-aware deep learning system by using a classical machine learning model as the secondary verification system to complement the primary deep learning model in image classification. Although the secondary classical machine learning model has less accurate output, it is only used for verification purposes, which does not impact the output accuracy of the primary deep learning model, and at the same time, can effectively detect an adversarial attack when a clear mismatch occurs. Our experiments based on CIFAR-100 dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art adversarial defense systems.

> Adversarial training, which is to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks, has received much attention because it is easy to generate human-imperceptible perturbations of data to deceive a given deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a new adversarial training algorithm that is theoretically well motivated and empirically superior to other existing algorithms. A novel feature of the proposed algorithm is to apply more regularization to data vulnerable to adversarial attacks than other existing regularization algorithms do. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm can be understood as an algorithm of minimizing the regularized empirical risk motivated from a newly derived upper bound of the robust risk. Numerical experiments illustrate that our proposed algorithm improves the generalization (accuracy on examples) and robustness (accuracy on adversarial attacks) simultaneously to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

> The predominant centralized paradigm in educational data management currently suffers from several critical issues such as vulnerability to malicious tampering, a high prevalence of diploma counterfeiting, and the onerous cost of certificate authentication. Decentralized blockchain technology, with its cutting-edge capabilities, presents a viable solution to these pervasive problems. In this paper, we illuminate the inherent limitations of existing centralized systems and introduce EduChain, a novel heterogeneous blockchain-based system for managing educational data. EduChain uniquely harnesses the strengths of both private and consortium blockchains, offering an unprecedented level of security and efficiency. In addition, we propose a robust mechanism for performing database consistency checks and error tracing. This is achieved through the implementation of a secondary consensus, employing the pt-table-checksum tool. This approach effectively addresses the prevalent issue of database mismatches. Our system demonstrates superior performance in key areas such as information verification, error traceback, and data security, thereby significantly improving the integrity and trustworthiness of educational data management.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results on real-life datasets and applications, including healthcare, finance, and education. However, recent studies have shown that GNNs are highly vulnerable to attacks such as membership inference attack and link reconstruction attack. Surprisingly, attribute inference attacks has received little attention. In this paper, we initiate the first investigation into attribute inference attack where an attacker aims to infer the sensitive user attributes based on her public or non-sensitive attributes. We ask the question whether black-box attribute inference attack constitutes a significant privacy risk for graph-structured data and their corresponding GNN model. We take a systematic approach to launch the attacks by varying the adversarial knowledge and assumptions. Our findings reveal that when an attacker has black-box access to the target model, GNNs generally do not reveal significantly more information compared to missing value estimation techniques.

> Cyberspace is a fragile construct threatened by malicious cyber operations of different actors, with vulnerabilities in IT hardware and software forming the basis for such activities, thus also posing a threat to global IT security. Advancements in the field of artificial intelligence accelerate this development, either with artificial intelligence enabled cyber weapons, automated cyber defense measures, or artificial intelligence-based threat and vulnerability detection. Especially state actors, with their long-term strategic security interests, often stockpile such knowledge of vulnerabilities and exploits to enable their military or intelligence service cyberspace operations. While treaties and regulations to limit these developments and to enhance global IT security by disclosing vulnerabilities are currently being discussed on the international level, these efforts are hindered by state concerns about the disclosure of unique knowledge and about giving up tactical advantages. This leads to a situation where multiple states are likely to stockpile at least some identical exploits, with technical measures to enable a depletion process for these stockpiles that preserve state secrecy interests and consider the special constraints of interacting states as well as the requirements within such environments being non-existent. This paper proposes such a privacy-preserving approach that allows multiple state parties to privately compare their stock of vulnerabilities and exploits to check for items that occur in multiple stockpiles without revealing them so that their disclosure can be considered. We call our system ExTRUST and show that it is scalable and can withstand several attack scenarios. Beyond the intergovernmental setting, ExTRUST can also be used for other zero-trust use cases, such as bug-bounty programs.

> Hidden cameras, also called spy cameras, are surveillance tools commonly used to spy on people without their knowledge. Whilst previous studies largely focused on investigating the detection of such a camera and the privacy implications, the security of the camera itself has received limited attention. Compared with ordinary IP cameras, spy cameras are normally sold in bulk at cheap prices and are ubiquitously deployed in hidden places within homes and workplaces. A security compromise of these cameras can have severe consequences. In this paper, we analyse a generic IP camera module, which has been packaged and re-branded for sale by several spy camera vendors. The module is controlled by mobile phone apps. By analysing the Android app and the traffic data, we reverse-engineered the security design of the whole system, including the module's Linux OS environment, the file structure, the authentication mechanism, the session management, and the communication with a remote server. Serious vulnerabilities have been identified in every component. Combined together, they allow an adversary to take complete control of a spy camera from anywhere over the Internet, enabling arbitrary code execution. This is possible even if the camera is behind a firewall. All that an adversary needs to launch an attack is the camera's serial number, which users sometimes unknowingly share in online reviews. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the manufacturer. Whilst the manufacturer acknowledged our work, they showed no intention to fix the problems. Patching or recalling the affected cameras is infeasible due to complexities in the supply chain. However, it is prudent to assume that bad actors have already been exploiting these flaws. We provide details of the identified vulnerabilities in order to raise public awareness, especially on the grave danger of disclosing a spy camera's serial number.

> Modern Deep Learning (DL) architectures based on transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) are exhibiting performance improvements across a number of natural language tasks. While such DL models have shown tremendous potential for use in software engineering applications, they are often hampered by insufficient training data. Particularly constrained are applications that require project-specific data, such as bug localization, which aims at recommending code to fix a newly submitted bug report. Deep learning models for bug localization require a substantial training set of fixed bug reports, which are at a limited quantity even in popular and actively developed software projects. In this paper, we examine the effect of using synthetic training data on transformer-based DL models that perform a more complex variant of bug localization, which has the goal of retrieving bug-inducing changesets for each bug report. To generate high-quality synthetic data, we propose novel data augmentation operators that act on different constituent components of bug reports. We also describe a data balancing strategy that aims to create a corpus of augmented bug reports that better reflects the entire source code base, because existing bug reports used as training data usually reference a small part of the code base.

> The Go programming language offers strong protection from memory corruption. As an escape hatch of these protections, it provides the unsafe package. Previous studies identified that this unsafe package is frequently used in real-world code for several purposes, e.g., serialization or casting types. Due to the variety of these reasons, it may be possible to refactor specific usages to avoid potential vulnerabilities. However, the classification of unsafe usages is challenging and requires the context of the call and the program's structure. In this paper, we present the first automated classifier for unsafe usages in Go, UNGOML, to identify what is done with the unsafe package and why it is used. For UNGOML, we built four custom deep learning classifiers trained on a manually labeled data set. We represent Go code as enriched control-flow graphs (CFGs) and solve the label prediction task with one single-vertex and three context-aware classifiers. All three context-aware classifiers achieve a top-1 accuracy of more than 86% for both dimensions, WHAT and WHY. Furthermore, in a set-valued conformal prediction setting, we achieve accuracies of more than 93% with mean label set sizes of 2 for both dimensions. Thus, UNGOML can be used to efficiently filter unsafe usages for use cases such as refactoring or a security audit.

> Deep learning models, even the-state-of-the-art ones, are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial training is one of the most efficient methods to improve the model's robustness. The key factor for the success of adversarial training is the capability to generate qualified and divergent adversarial examples which satisfy some objectives/goals (e.g., finding adversarial examples that maximize the model losses for simultaneously attacking multiple models). Therefore, multi-objective optimization (MOO) is a natural tool for adversarial example generation to achieve multiple objectives/goals simultaneously. However, we observe that a naive application of MOO tends to maximize all objectives/goals equally, without caring if an objective/goal has been achieved yet. This leads to useless effort to further improve the goal-achieved tasks, while putting less focus on the goal-unachieved tasks. In this paper, we propose \emph{Task Oriented MOO} to address this issue, in the context where we can explicitly define the goal achievement for a task. Our principle is to only maintain the goal-achieved tasks, while letting the optimizer spend more effort on improving the goal-unachieved tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments for our Task Oriented MOO on various adversarial example generation schemes. The experimental results firmly demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/tuananhbui89/TAMOO}.

> A robust summarization system should be able to capture the gist of the document, regardless of the specific word choices or noise in the input. In this work, we first explore the summarization models' robustness against perturbations including word-level synonym substitution and noise. To create semantic-consistent substitutes, we propose a SummAttacker, which is an efficient approach to generating adversarial samples based on language models. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art summarization models have a significant decrease in performance on adversarial and noisy test sets. Next, we analyze the vulnerability of the summarization systems and explore improving the robustness by data augmentation. Specifically, the first brittleness factor we found is the poor understanding of infrequent words in the input. Correspondingly, we feed the encoder with more diverse cases created by SummAttacker in the input space. The other factor is in the latent space, where the attacked inputs bring more variations to the hidden states. Hence, we construct adversarial decoder input and devise manifold softmixing operation in hidden space to introduce more diversity. Experimental results on Gigaword and CNN/DM datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over strong baselines and exhibits higher robustness on noisy, attacked, and clean datasets.

> Ranking functions such as PageRank assign numeric values (ranks) to nodes of graphs, most notably the web graph. Node rankings are an integral part of Internet search algorithms, since they can be used to order the results of queries. However, these ranking functions are famously subject to attacks by spammers, who modify the web graph in order to give their own pages more rank. We characterize the interplay between rankers and spammers as a game. We define the two critical features of this game, spam resistance and distortion, based on how spammers spam and how rankers protect against spam. We observe that all the ranking functions that are well-studied in the literature, including the original formulation of PageRank, have poor spam resistance, poor distortion, or both. Finally, we study Min-PPR, the form of PageRank used at Google itself, but which has received no (theoretical or empirical) treatment in the literature. We prove that Min-PPR has low distortion and high spam resistance. A secondary benefit is that Min-PPR comes with an explicit cost function on nodes that shows how important they are to the spammer; thus a ranker can focus their spam-detection capacity on these vulnerable nodes. Both Min-PPR and its associated cost function are straightforward to compute.

> Arabic dialect identification (ADI) tools are an important part of the large-scale data collection pipelines necessary for training speech recognition models. As these pipelines require application of ADI tools to potentially out-of-domain data, we aim to investigate how vulnerable the tools may be to this domain shift. With self-supervised learning (SSL) models as a starting point, we evaluate transfer learning and direct classification from SSL features. We undertake our evaluation under rich conditions, with a goal to develop ADI systems from pretrained models and ultimately evaluate performance on newly collected data. In order to understand what factors contribute to model decisions, we carry out a careful human study of a subset of our data. Our analysis confirms that domain shift is a major challenge for ADI models. We also find that while self-training does alleviate this challenges, it may be insufficient for realistic conditions.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples obtained by adding small perturbations to original examples. The added perturbations in existing attacks are mainly determined by the gradient of the loss function with respect to the inputs. In this paper, the close relationship between gradient-based attacks and the numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equation (ODE) is studied for the first time. Inspired by the numerical solution of ODE, a new prediction-correction (PC) based adversarial attack is proposed. In our proposed PC-based attack, some existing attack can be selected to produce a predicted example first, and then the predicted example and the current example are combined together to determine the added perturbations. The proposed method possesses good extensibility and can be applied to all available gradient-based attacks easily. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks, our proposed PC-based attacks have higher attack success rates, and exhibit better transferability.

> Biometric systems are vulnerable to Presentation Attacks (PA) performed using various Presentation Attack Instruments (PAIs). Even though there are numerous Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) techniques based on both deep learning and hand-crafted features, the generalization of PAD for unknown PAI is still a challenging problem. In this work, we empirically prove that the initialization of the PAD model is a crucial factor for the generalization, which is rarely discussed in the community. Based on such observation, we proposed a self-supervised learning-based method, denoted as DF-DM. Specifically, DF-DM is based on a global-local view coupled with De-Folding and De-Mixing to derive the task-specific representation for PAD. During De-Folding, the proposed technique will learn region-specific features to represent samples in a local pattern by explicitly minimizing generative loss. While De-Mixing drives detectors to obtain the instance-specific features with global information for more comprehensive representation by minimizing interpolation-based consistency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve significant improvements in terms of both face and fingerprint PAD in more complicated and hybrid datasets when compared with state-of-the-art methods. When training in CASIA-FASD and Idiap Replay-Attack, the proposed method can achieve an 18.60% Equal Error Rate (EER) in OULU-NPU and MSU-MFSD, exceeding baseline performance by 9.54%. The source code of the proposed technique is available at https://github.com/kongzhecn/dfdm.

> Weight oscillation is an undesirable side effect of quantization-aware training, in which quantized weights frequently jump between two quantized levels, resulting in training instability and a sub-optimal final model. We discover that the learnable scaling factor, a widely-used $\textit{de facto}$ setting in quantization aggravates weight oscillation. In this study, we investigate the connection between the learnable scaling factor and quantized weight oscillation and use ViT as a case driver to illustrate the findings and remedies. In addition, we also found that the interdependence between quantized weights in $\textit{query}$ and $\textit{key}$ of a self-attention layer makes ViT vulnerable to oscillation. We, therefore, propose three techniques accordingly: statistical weight quantization ($\rm StatsQ$) to improve quantization robustness compared to the prevalent learnable-scale-based method; confidence-guided annealing ($\rm CGA$) that freezes the weights with $\textit{high confidence}$ and calms the oscillating weights; and $\textit{query}$-$\textit{key}$ reparameterization ($\rm QKR$) to resolve the query-key intertwined oscillation and mitigate the resulting gradient misestimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these proposed techniques successfully abate weight oscillation and consistently achieve substantial accuracy improvement on ImageNet. Specifically, our 2-bit DeiT-T/DeiT-S algorithms outperform the previous state-of-the-art by 9.8% and 7.7%, respectively. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/nbasyl/OFQ.

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in both text understanding and generation. Companies have begun to offer Embedding as a Service (EaaS) based on these LLMs, which can benefit various natural language processing (NLP) tasks for customers. However, previous studies have shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which can cause significant losses for the owners of LLMs, as training these models is extremely expensive. To protect the copyright of LLMs for EaaS, we propose an Embedding Watermark method called EmbMarker that implants backdoors on embeddings. Our method selects a group of moderate-frequency words from a general text corpus to form a trigger set, then selects a target embedding as the watermark, and inserts it into the embeddings of texts containing trigger words as the backdoor. The weight of insertion is proportional to the number of trigger words included in the text. This allows the watermark backdoor to be effectively transferred to EaaS-stealer's model for copyright verification while minimizing the adverse impact on the original embeddings' utility. Our extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method can effectively protect the copyright of EaaS models without compromising service quality.

> Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) refrain from the traditional layer-stacking paradigm and turn to find the fixed point of a single layer. DEQs have achieved promising performance on different applications with featured memory efficiency. At the same time, the adversarial vulnerability of DEQs raises concerns. Several works propose to certify robustness for monotone DEQs. However, limited efforts are devoted to studying empirical robustness for general DEQs. To this end, we observe that an adversarially trained DEQ requires more forward steps to arrive at the equilibrium state, or even violates its fixed-point structure. Besides, the forward and backward tracks of DEQs are misaligned due to the black-box solvers. These facts cause gradient obfuscation when applying the ready-made attacks to evaluate or adversarially train DEQs. Given this, we develop approaches to estimate the intermediate gradients of DEQs and integrate them into the attacking pipelines. Our approaches facilitate fully white-box evaluations and lead to effective adversarial defense for DEQs. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 validate the adversarial robustness of DEQs competitive with deep networks of similar sizes.

> In the last decade, damage detection approaches swiftly changed from advanced signal processing methods to machine learning and especially deep learning models, to accurately and non-intrusively estimate the state of the beam structures. But as the deep learning models reached their peak performances, also their limitations in applicability and vulnerabilities were observed. One of the most important reason for the lack of trustworthiness in operational conditions is the absence of intrinsic explainability of the deep learning system, due to the encoding of the knowledge in tensor values and without the inclusion of logical constraints. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic model for the detection of damages in cantilever beams based on a novel cognitive architecture in which we join the processing power of convolutional networks with the interactive control offered by queries realized through the inclusion of real logic directly into the model. The hybrid discriminative model is introduced under the name Logic Convolutional Neural Regressor and it is tested on a dataset of values of the relative natural frequency shifts of cantilever beams derived from an original mathematical relation. While the obtained results preserve all the predictive capabilities of deep learning models, the usage of three distances as predicates for satisfiability, makes the system more trustworthy and scalable for practical applications. Extensive numerical and laboratory experiments were performed, and they all demonstrated the superiority of the hybrid approach, which can open a new path for solving the damage detection problem.

> To effectively guide the exploration of the code transform space for automated code evolution techniques, we present in this paper the first approach for structurally predicting code transforms at the level of AST nodes using conditional random fields (CRFs). Our approach first learns offline a probabilistic model that captures how certain code transforms are applied to certain AST nodes, and then uses the learned model to predict transforms for arbitrary new, unseen code snippets. {Our approach involves a novel representation of both programs and code transforms. Specifically, we introduce the formal framework for defining the so-called AST-level code transforms and we demonstrate how the CRF model can be accordingly designed, learned, and used for prediction}. We instantiate our approach in the context of repair transform prediction for Java programs. Our instantiation contains a set of carefully designed code features, deals with the training data imbalance issue, and comprises transform constraints that are specific to code. We conduct a large-scale experimental evaluation based on a dataset of bug fixing commits from real-world Java projects. The results show that when the popular evaluation metric \emph{top-3} is used, our approach predicts the code transforms with an accuracy varying from 41\% to 53\% depending on the transforms. Our model outperforms two baselines based on history probability and neural machine translation (NMT), suggesting the importance of considering code structure in achieving good prediction accuracy. In addition, a proof-of-concept synthesizer is implemented to concretize some repair transforms to get the final patches. The evaluation of the synthesizer on the Defects4j benchmark confirms the usefulness of the predicted AST-level repair transforms in producing high-quality patches.

> Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm that operates at the wireless edge. It enables clients to collaborate on model training while keeping their data private from adversaries and the central server. However, current FL approaches have limitations. Some rely on secure multiparty computation, which can be vulnerable to inference attacks. Others employ differential privacy, but this may lead to decreased test accuracy when dealing with a large number of parties contributing small amounts of data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel approach that integrates federated learning seamlessly into the inner workings of MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) systems.

> Collaborative learning algorithms, such as distributed SGD (or D-SGD), are prone to faulty machines that may deviate from their prescribed algorithm because of software or hardware bugs, poisoned data or malicious behaviors. While many solutions have been proposed to enhance the robustness of D-SGD to such machines, previous works either resort to strong assumptions (trusted server, homogeneous data, specific noise model) or impose a gradient computational cost that is several orders of magnitude higher than that of D-SGD. We present MoNNA, a new algorithm that (a) is provably robust under standard assumptions and (b) has a gradient computation overhead that is linear in the fraction of faulty machines, which is conjectured to be tight. Essentially, MoNNA uses Polyak's momentum of local gradients for local updates and nearest-neighbor averaging (NNA) for global mixing, respectively. While MoNNA is rather simple to implement, its analysis has been more challenging and relies on two key elements that may be of independent interest. Specifically, we introduce the mixing criterion of $(\alpha, \lambda)$-reduction to analyze the non-linear mixing of non-faulty machines, and present a way to control the tension between the momentum and the model drifts. We validate our theory by experiments on image classification and make our code available at https://github.com/LPD-EPFL/robust-collaborative-learning.

> The emergence of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers has important consequences for cryptographic algorithms. It is theoretically well-established that key algorithms used in cybersecurity are vulnerable to quantum computers due to the fact that theoretical security guarantees, designed based on algorithmic complexity for classical computers, are not sufficient for quantum circuits. Many different quantum algorithms have been developed, which have potentially broad applications on future computing systems. However, this potential depends on the continued maturation of quantum hardware, which remains an area of active research and development. Theoretical limits provide an upper bound on the performance for algorithms. In practice, threats to encryption can only be accurately be assessed in the context of the rapidly evolving hardware and software landscape. Software co-design refers to the concurrent design of software and hardware as a way to understand the limitations of current capabilities and develop effective strategies to advance the state of the art. Since the capabilities for classical computation currently exceed quantum capabilities, quantum emulation techniques can play an important role in the co-design process. In this paper, we describe how the {\em cuQuantum} environment can support quantum algorithm co-design activities using widely-available commodity hardware. We describe how emulation techniques can be used to assess the impact of noise on algorithms of interest, and identify limitations associated with current hardware. We present our analysis in the context of areas of priority for cybersecurity and cryptography in particular since these algorithms are extraordinarily consequential for securing information in the digital world.

> Deep learning (DL) applications are prevalent nowadays as they can help with multiple tasks. DL libraries are essential for building DL applications. Furthermore, DL operators are the important building blocks of the DL libraries, that compute the multi-dimensional data (tensors). Therefore, bugs in DL operators can have great impacts. Testing is a practical approach for detecting bugs in DL operators. In order to test DL operators effectively, it is essential that the test cases pass the input validity check and are able to reach the core function logic of the operators. Hence, extracting the input validation constraints is required for generating high-quality test cases. Existing techniques rely on either human effort or documentation of DL library APIs to extract the constraints. They cannot extract complex constraints and the extracted constraints may differ from the actual code implementation.   To address the challenge, we propose ACETest, a technique to automatically extract input validation constraints from the code to build valid yet diverse test cases which can effectively unveil bugs in the core function logic of DL operators. For this purpose, ACETest can automatically identify the input validation code in DL operators, extract the related constraints and generate test cases according to the constraints. The experimental results on popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch, demonstrate that ACETest can extract constraints with higher quality than state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Moreover, ACETest is capable of extracting 96.4% more constraints and detecting 1.95 to 55 times more bugs than SOTA techniques. In total, we have used ACETest to detect 108 previously unknown bugs on TensorFlow and PyTorch, with 87 of them confirmed by the developers. Lastly, five of the bugs were assigned with CVE IDs due to their security impacts.

> Multiverse analysis, a paradigm for statistical analysis that considers all combinations of reasonable analysis choices in parallel, promises to improve transparency and reproducibility. Although recent tools help analysts specify multiverse analyses, they remain difficult to use in practice. In this work, we identify debugging as a key barrier due to the latency from running analyses to detecting bugs and the scale of metadata processing needed to diagnose a bug. To address these challenges, we prototype a command-line interface tool, Multiverse Debugger, which helps diagnose bugs in the multiverse and propagate fixes. In a qualitative lab study (n=13), we use Multiverse Debugger as a probe to develop a model of debugging workflows and identify specific challenges, including difficulty in understanding the multiverse's composition. We conclude with design implications for future multiverse analysis authoring systems.

> Federated learning has exhibited vulnerabilities to Byzantine attacks, where the Byzantine attackers can send arbitrary gradients to a central server to destroy the convergence and performance of the global model. A wealth of robust AGgregation Rules (AGRs) have been proposed to defend against Byzantine attacks. However, Byzantine clients can still circumvent robust AGRs when data is non-Identically and Independently Distributed (non-IID). In this paper, we first reveal the root causes of performance degradation of current robust AGRs in non-IID settings: the curse of dimensionality and gradient heterogeneity. In order to address this issue, we propose GAS, a \shorten approach that can successfully adapt existing robust AGRs to non-IID settings. We also provide a detailed convergence analysis when the existing robust AGRs are combined with GAS. Experiments on various real-world datasets verify the efficacy of our proposed GAS. The implementation code is provided in https://github.com/YuchenLiu-a/byzantine-gas.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn the representation of graph-structured data, and their expressiveness can be further enhanced by inferring node relations for propagation. Attention-based GNNs infer neighbor importance to manipulate the weight of its propagation. Despite their popularity, the discussion on deep graph attention and its unique challenges has been limited. In this work, we investigate some problematic phenomena related to deep graph attention, including vulnerability to over-smoothed features and smooth cumulative attention. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that various attention-based GNNs suffer from these problems. Motivated by our findings, we propose AEROGNN, a novel GNN architecture designed for deep graph attention. AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with (a) its adaptive and less smooth attention functions and (b) higher performance at deep layers (up to 64). On 9 out of 12 node classification benchmarks, AERO-GNN outperforms the baseline GNNs, highlighting the advantages of deep graph attention.

> Social media has drastically reshaped the world that allows billions of people to engage in such interactive environments to conveniently create and share content with the public. Among them, text data (e.g., tweets, blogs) maintains the basic yet important social activities and generates a rich source of user-oriented information. While those explicit sensitive user data like credentials has been significantly protected by all means, personal private attribute (e.g., age, gender, location) disclosure due to inference attacks is somehow challenging to avoid, especially when powerful natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been effectively deployed to automate attribute inferences from implicit text data. This puts users' attribute privacy at risk. To address this challenge, in this paper, we leverage the inherent vulnerability of machine learning to adversarial attacks, and design a novel text-space Adversarial attack for Social Good, called Adv4SG. In other words, we cast the problem of protecting personal attribute privacy as an adversarial attack formulation problem over the social media text data to defend against NLP-based attribute inference attacks. More specifically, Adv4SG proceeds with a sequence of word perturbations under given constraints such that the probed attribute cannot be identified correctly. Different from the prior works, we advance Adv4SG by considering social media property, and introducing cost-effective mechanisms to expedite attribute obfuscation over text data under the black-box setting. Extensive experiments on real-world social media datasets have demonstrated that our method can effectively degrade the inference accuracy with less computational cost over different attribute settings, which substantially helps mitigate the impacts of inference attacks and thus achieve high performance in user attribute privacy protection.

> Federated learning is a new learning paradigm for extracting knowledge from distributed data. Due to its favorable properties in preserving privacy and saving communication costs, it has been extensively studied and widely applied to numerous data analysis applications. However, most existing federated learning approaches concentrate on the centralized setting, which is vulnerable to a single-point failure. An alternative strategy for addressing this issue is the decentralized communication topology. In this article, we systematically investigate the challenges and opportunities when renovating decentralized optimization for federated learning. In particular, we discussed them from the model, data, and communication sides, respectively, which can deepen our understanding about decentralized federated learning.

> The escalating digitalisation of our lives and enterprises has led to a parallel growth in the complexity and frequency of cyber-attacks. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in Australia, are experiencing increased vulnerability to cyber threats, posing a significant challenge to the nation's cyber security landscape. Embracing transformative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs) can potentially strengthen cyber security policies for Australian SMEs. However, their practical application, advantages, and limitations remain underexplored, with prior research mainly focusing on large corporations. This study aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive understanding of the potential role of LLMs in enhancing cyber security policies for Australian SMEs. Employing a mixed-methods study design, this research includes a literature review, qualitative analysis of SME case studies, and a quantitative assessment of LLM performance metrics in cyber security applications. The findings highlight the promising potential of LLMs across various performance criteria, including relevance, accuracy, and applicability, though gaps remain in areas such as completeness and clarity. The study underlines the importance of integrating human expertise with LLM technology and refining model development to address these limitations. By proposing a robust conceptual framework guiding the effective adoption of LLMs, this research aims to contribute to a safer and more resilient cyber environment for Australian SMEs, enabling sustainable growth and competitiveness in the digital era.

> Recently, the newly emerged multimodal models, which leverage both visual and linguistic modalities to train powerful encoders, have gained increasing attention. However, learning from a large-scale unlabeled dataset also exposes the model to the risk of potential poisoning attacks, whereby the adversary aims to perturb the model's training data to trigger malicious behaviors in it. In contrast to previous work, only poisoning visual modality, in this work, we take the first step to studying poisoning attacks against multimodal models in both visual and linguistic modalities. Specially, we focus on answering two questions: (1) Is the linguistic modality also vulnerable to poisoning attacks? and (2) Which modality is most vulnerable? To answer the two questions, we propose three types of poisoning attacks against multimodal models. Extensive evaluations on different datasets and model architectures show that all three attacks can achieve significant attack performance while maintaining model utility in both visual and linguistic modalities. Furthermore, we observe that the poisoning effect differs between different modalities. To mitigate the attacks, we propose both pre-training and post-training defenses. We empirically show that both defenses can significantly reduce the attack performance while preserving the model's utility.

> Deep neural networks are capable of state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks. However, they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- small perturbations to the input that lead to a change in classification. We address this issue from the perspective of backward error and condition number, concepts that have proved useful in numerical analysis. To do this, we build on the work of Beuzeville et al. (2021). In particular, we develop a new class of attack algorithms that use componentwise relative perturbations. Such attacks are highly relevant in the case of handwritten documents or printed texts where, for example, the classification of signatures, postcodes, dates or numerical quantities may be altered by changing only the ink consistency and not the background. This makes the perturbed images look natural to the naked eye. Such ``adversarial ink'' attacks therefore reveal a weakness that can have a serious impact on safety and security. We illustrate the new attacks on real data and contrast them with existing algorithms. We also study the use of a componentwise condition number to quantify vulnerability.

- `2306.03234v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03234v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03234v1)

> Deep Learning (DL) models to analyze source code have shown immense promise during the past few years. More recently, self-supervised pre-training has gained traction for learning generic code representations valuable for many downstream SE tasks, such as clone and bug detection.   While previous work successfully learned from different code abstractions (e.g., token, AST, graph), we argue that it is also essential to factor in how developers code day-to-day for general-purpose representation learning. On the one hand, human developers tend to write repetitive programs referencing existing code snippets from the current codebase or online resources (e.g., Stack Overflow website) rather than implementing functions from scratch; such behaviors result in a vast number of code clones. In contrast, a deviant clone by mistake might trigger malicious program behaviors.   Thus, as a proxy to incorporate developers' coding behavior into the pre-training scheme, we propose to include code clones and their deviants. In particular, we propose CONCORD, a self-supervised, contrastive learning strategy to place benign clones closer in the representation space while moving deviants further apart. We show that CONCORD's clone-aware contrastive learning drastically reduces the need for expensive pre-training resources while improving the performance of downstream SE tasks. We also empirically demonstrate that CONCORD can improve existing pre-trained models to learn better representations that consequently become more efficient in both identifying semantically equivalent programs and differentiating buggy from non-buggy code.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance on graph-structured data. However, recent empirical studies suggest that GNNs are very susceptible to distribution shift. There is still significant ambiguity about why graph-based models seem more vulnerable to these shifts. In this work we provide a thorough theoretical analysis on it by quantifying the magnitude of conditional shift between the input features and the output label. Our findings show that both graph heterophily and model architecture exacerbate conditional shifts, leading to performance degradation. To address this, we propose an approach that involves estimating and minimizing the conditional shift for unsupervised domain adaptation on graphs. In our controlled synthetic experiments, our algorithm demonstrates robustness towards distribution shift, resulting in up to 10% absolute ROC AUC improvement versus the second-best algorithm. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on both node classification and graph classification show its robust performance under various distribution shifts.

> Current approaches to novelty or anomaly detection are based on deep neural networks. Despite their effectiveness, neural networks are also vulnerable to imperceptible deformations of the input data. This is a serious issue in critical applications, or when data alterations are generated by an adversarial attack. While this is a known problem that has been studied in recent years for the case of supervised learning, the case of novelty detection has received very limited attention. Indeed, in this latter setting the learning is typically unsupervised because outlier data is not available during training, and new approaches for this case need to be investigated. We propose a new prior that aims at learning a robust likelihood for the novelty test, as a defense against attacks. We also integrate the same prior with a state-of-the-art novelty detection approach. Because of the geometric properties of that approach, the resulting robust training is computationally very efficient. An initial evaluation of the method indicates that it is effective at improving performance with respect to the standard models in the absence and presence of attacks.

> Bitcoin-NG is an extensible blockchain protocol based on the same trust model as Bitcoin. It divides each epoch into one Key-Block and multiple Micro-Blocks, effectively improving transaction processing capacity. Bitcoin-NG adopts a special incentive mechanism (i.e., the transaction fees in each epoch are split to the current and next leader) to maintain its security. However, there are some limitations to the existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG in recent works. First, the incentive division method of Bitcoin-NG only includes some specific mining attack strategies of adversary, while ignoring more stubborn attack strategies. Second, once adversaries find a whale transaction, they will deviate from honest mining strategy to obtain extra reward. In this paper, we are committed to solving these two limitations. First, we propose a novel mining strategy named Greedy-Mine attack. Then, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to analyze the competition of honest miners and adversaries. Furthermore, we analysis the extra reward of adversaries and summarize the mining power proportion range required for malicious adversaries to launch Greedy-Mine to obtain extra returns. Finally, we make a backward-compatibility progressive modification to Bitcoin-NG protocol that would raise the threshold of propagation factor from 0 to 1. Meanwhile, we get the winning condition of adversaries when adopting Greedy-Mine, compared with honest mining. Simulation and experimental results indicate that Bitcoin-NG is not incentive compatible, which is vulnerable to Greedy-Mine attack.

> Security has become a significant concern with the increased popularity of cloud storage services. It comes with the vulnerability of being accessed by third parties. Security is one of the major hurdles in the cloud server for the user when the user data that reside in local storage is outsourced to the cloud. It has given rise to security concerns involved in data confidentiality even after the deletion of data from cloud storage. Though, it raises a serious problem when the encrypted data needs to be shared with more people than the data owner initially designated. However, searching on encrypted data is a fundamental issue in cloud storage. The method of searching over encrypted data represents a significant challenge in the cloud.   Searchable encryption allows a cloud server to conduct a search over encrypted data on behalf of the data users without learning the underlying plaintexts. While many academic SE schemes show provable security, they usually expose some query information, making them less practical, weak in usability, and challenging to deploy. Also, sharing encrypted data with other authorized users must provide each document's secret key. However, this way has many limitations due to the difficulty of key management and distribution.   We have designed the system using the existing cryptographic approaches, ensuring the search on encrypted data over the cloud. The primary focus of our proposed model is to ensure user privacy and security through a less computationally intensive, user-friendly system with a trusted third party entity. To demonstrate our proposed model, we have implemented a web application called CryptoSearch as an overlay system on top of a well-known cloud storage domain. It exhibits secure search on encrypted data with no compromise to the user-friendliness and the scheme's functional performance in real-world applications.

> The prevalence of software systems has become an integral part of modern-day living. Software usage has increased significantly, leading to its growth in both size and complexity. Consequently, software development is becoming a more time-consuming process. In an attempt to accelerate the development cycle, the testing phase is often neglected, leading to the deployment of flawed systems that can have significant implications on the users daily activities. This work presents TestLab, an intelligent automated software testing framework that attempts to gather a set of testing methods and automate them using Artificial Intelligence to allow continuous testing of software systems at multiple levels from different scopes, ranging from developers to end-users. The tool consists of three modules, each serving a distinct purpose. The first two modules aim to identify vulnerabilities from different perspectives, while the third module enhances traditional automated software testing by automatically generating test cases through source code analysis.

> The increasing reliance on the internet has led to the proliferation of a diverse set of web-browsers and operating systems (OSs) capable of browsing the web. User agent strings (UASs) are a component of web browsing that are transmitted with every Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request. They contain information about the client device and software, which is used by web servers for various purposes such as content negotiation and security. However, due to the proliferation of various browsers and devices, parsing UASs is a non-trivial task due to a lack of standardization of UAS formats. Current rules-based approaches are often brittle and can fail when encountering such non-standard formats. In this work, a novel methodology for parsing UASs using Multi-Headed Attention Based transformers is proposed. The proposed methodology exhibits strong performance in parsing a variety of UASs with differing formats. Furthermore, a framework to utilize parsed UASs to estimate the vulnerability scores for large sections of publicly visible IT networks or regions is also discussed. The methodology present here can also be easily extended or deployed for real-time parsing of logs in enterprise settings.

> WebView is a UI widget that helps integrate web applications into the native context of Android apps. It provides powerful mechanisms for bi-directional interactions between the native-end (Java) and the web-end (JavaScript) of an Android app. However, these interaction mechanisms are complicated and have induced various types of bugs. To mitigate the problem, various techniques have been proposed to detect WebView-induced bugs via dynamic analysis, which heavily relies on executing tests to explore WebView behaviors. Unfortunately, these techniques either require manual effort or adopt random test generation approaches, which are not able to effectively explore diverse WebView behaviors. In this paper, we study the problem of test generation for WebViews in Android apps. Effective test generation for WebViews requires identifying the essential program properties to be covered by the generated tests. To this end, we propose WebView-specific properties to characterize WebView behaviors, and devise a cross-language dynamic analysis method to identify these properties. We develop $\omega$Test, a test generation technique that searches for event sequences covering the identified WebView-specific properties. An evaluation on 74 real-world open-/closed-source Android apps shows that $\omega$Test can cover diverse WebView behaviors and detect WebView-induced bugs effectively. $\omega$Test detected 36 previously-unknown bugs. From the 22 bugs that we have reported to the app developers, 13 bugs were confirmed, 9 of which were fixed.

> Sketching is one of the most fundamental tools in large-scale machine learning. It enables runtime and memory saving via randomly compressing the original large problem into lower dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel sketching scheme for the first order method in large-scale distributed learning setting, such that the communication costs between distributed agents are saved while the convergence of the algorithms is still guaranteed. Given gradient information in a high dimension $d$, the agent passes the compressed information processed by a sketching matrix $R\in \mathbb{R}^{s\times d}$ with $s\ll d$, and the receiver de-compressed via the de-sketching matrix $R^\top$ to ``recover'' the information in original dimension. Using such a framework, we develop algorithms for federated learning with lower communication costs. However, such random sketching does not protect the privacy of local data directly. We show that the gradient leakage problem still exists after applying the sketching technique by presenting a specific gradient attack method. As a remedy, we prove rigorously that the algorithm will be differentially private by adding additional random noises in gradient information, which results in a both communication-efficient and differentially private first order approach for federated learning tasks. Our sketching scheme can be further generalized to other learning settings and might be of independent interest itself.

> Vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts often cause serious financial damage. Whereas the Solidity compiler has been updated to prevent vulnerabilities, its effectiveness has not been revealed so far, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we shed light on the impact of compiler versions of vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts. To this end, we collected 503,572 contracts with Solidity source codes in the Ethereum blockchain and then analyzed their vulnerabilities. For three vulnerabilities with high severity, i.e., Locked Money, Using tx.origin, and Unchecked Call, we show that their appearance rates are decreased by virtue of major updates of the Solidity compiler. We then found the following four key insights. First, after the release of version 0.6, the appearance rate for Locked Money has decreased. Second, regardless of compiler updates, the appearance rate for Using tx.origin is significantly low. Third, although the appearance rate for Unchecked Call has decreased in version 0.8, it still remains high due to various factors, including code clones. Fourth, through analysis of code clones, our promising results show that the appearance rate for Unchecked Call can be further decreased by removing the code clones.

> A system vulnerability analysis technique (SVAT) for complex mission critical systems (CMCS) was developed in response to the need to be able to conduct penetration testing on large industrial systems which cannot be taken offline or risk disablement or impairment for conventional penetration testing. SVAT-CMCS facilitates the use of known vulnerability and exploit information, incremental testing of system components and data analysis techniques to identify attack pathways in CMCSs. This data can be utilized for corrective activities or to target controlled manual follow-up testing. This paper presents the SVAT-CMCS paradigm and describes its implementation in a software tool, which was built using the Blackboard Architecture, that can be utilized for attack pathway identification. The performance of this tool is characterized using three example models. In particular, it explores the path generation speed and the impact of link cap restrictions on system operations, under different levels of network size and complexity. Accurate fact-rule processing is also tested using these models. The results show significant decreases in path generation efficiency as the link cap and network complexity increase; however, rule processing accuracy is not impacted.

While this fuzzer facilitates the detection of system and software defects and vulnerabilities, it also facilitates the determination of the impact of settings on device operations. This later capability facilitates the modeling of the devices in a cybersecurity risk assessment and analysis system. This paper describes and assesses the performance of the proposed fuzzer technology. It also details how the fuzzer operates as part of the broader cybersecurity risk assessment and analysis system.

> To train image-caption retrieval (ICR) methods, contrastive loss functions are a common choice for optimization functions. Unfortunately, contrastive ICR methods are vulnerable to predictive feature suppression. Predictive features are features that correctly indicate the similarity between a query and a candidate item. However, in the presence of multiple predictive features during training, encoder models tend to suppress redundant predictive features, since these features are not needed to learn to discriminate between positive and negative pairs. While some predictive features are redundant during training, these features might be relevant during evaluation. We introduce an approach to reduce predictive feature suppression for resource-constrained ICR methods: latent target decoding (LTD). We add an additional decoder to the contrastive ICR framework, to reconstruct the input caption in a latent space of a general-purpose sentence encoder, which prevents the image and caption encoder from suppressing predictive features. We implement the LTD objective as an optimization constraint, to ensure that the reconstruction loss is below a bound value while primarily optimizing for the contrastive loss. Importantly, LTD does not depend on additional training data or expensive (hard) negative mining strategies. Our experiments show that, unlike reconstructing the input caption in the input space, LTD reduces predictive feature suppression, measured by obtaining higher recall@k, r-precision, and nDCG scores than a contrastive ICR baseline. Moreover, we show that LTD should be implemented as an optimization constraint instead of a dual optimization objective. Finally, we show that LTD can be used with different contrastive learning losses and a wide variety of resource-constrained ICR methods.

> Open-Domain Conversational Question Answering (ODConvQA) aims at answering questions through a multi-turn conversation based on a retriever-reader pipeline, which retrieves passages and then predicts answers with them. However, such a pipeline approach not only makes the reader vulnerable to the errors propagated from the retriever, but also demands additional effort to develop both the retriever and the reader, which further makes it slower since they are not runnable in parallel. In this work, we propose a method to directly predict answers with a phrase retrieval scheme for a sequence of words, reducing the conventional two distinct subtasks into a single one. Also, for the first time, we study its capability for ODConvQA tasks. However, simply adopting it is largely problematic, due to the dependencies between previous and current turns in a conversation. To address this problem, we further introduce a novel contrastive learning strategy, making sure to reflect previous turns when retrieving the phrase for the current context, by maximizing representational similarities of consecutive turns in a conversation while minimizing irrelevant conversational contexts. We validate our model on two ODConvQA datasets, whose experimental results show that it substantially outperforms the relevant baselines with the retriever-reader. Code is available at: https://github.com/starsuzi/PRO-ConvQA.

> Quality assurance (QA) tools are receiving more and more attention and are widely used by developers. Given the wide range of solutions for QA technology, it is still a question of evaluating QA tools. Most existing research is limited in the following ways: (i) They compare tools without considering scanning rules analysis. (ii) They disagree on the effectiveness of tools due to the study methodology and benchmark dataset. (iii) They do not separately analyze the role of the warnings. (iv) There is no large-scale study on the analysis of time performance. To address these problems, in the paper, we systematically select 6 free or open-source tools for a comprehensive study from a list of 148 existing Java QA tools. To carry out a comprehensive study and evaluate tools in multi-level dimensions, we first mapped the scanning rules to the CWE and analyze the coverage and granularity of the scanning rules. Then we conducted an experiment on 5 benchmarks, including 1,425 bugs, to investigate the effectiveness of these tools. Furthermore, we took substantial effort to investigate the effectiveness of warnings by comparing the real labeled bugs with the warnings and investigating their role in bug detection. Finally, we assessed these tools' time performance on 1,049 projects. The useful findings based on our comprehensive study can help developers improve their tools and provide users with suggestions for selecting QA tools.

> Exploit proof-of-concepts (PoCs) for known vulnerabilities are widely shared in the security community. They help security analysts to learn from each other and they facilitate security assessments and red teaming tasks. In the recent years, PoCs have been widely distributed, e.g., via dedicated websites and platforms, and public code repositories such as GitHub. However, there is no guarantee that PoCs in public code repositories come from trustworthy sources or even that they do what they are supposed to do.   In this work we investigate GitHub-hosted PoCs for known vulnerabilities discovered in 2017--2021. We discovered that not all PoCs are trustworthy. Some proof-of-concepts are malicious, e.g., they attempt to exfiltrate data from the system they are being run on, or they try to install malware on this system, and in some cases they have hard-coded reverse shell listener.   To measure the prevalence of this threat, we propose an approach to detecting malicious PoCs. Our approach relies on the maliciousness symptoms we have observed in our PoC dataset: calls to malicious IP addresses, encoded malicious code, and included Trojanized binaries. With this approach, we have discovered 899 malicious repositories out of 47,285 repositories that have been downloaded and checked (i.e., 1.9% of the studied repositories have indicators of malicious intent). This figure shows a worrying prevalence of dangerous malicious PoCs among the exploit code distributed on GitHub.

> The immutable and trustable characteristics of blockchain enable smart contracts to be applied in various fields. Unfortunately, smart contracts are subject to various vulnerabilities, which are frequently exploited by attackers, causing financial damage to users.In this paper, we study the problem of vulnerable smart contract function locating. We construct a novel Multi-Relational Nested contract Graph (MRNG) to better characterize the rich syntactic and semantic information in the smart contract code, including the relationships between data and instructions. An MRNG represents a smart contract, where each node represents a function in the smart contract and each edge describes the calling relationship between the functions. In addition, we create a Multi-Relational Function Graph (MRFG) for each function, which characterizes the corresponding function code. That is, each function is characterized as an MRFG, which corresponds to a node in the MRNG. Each MRFG uses different types of edges to represent the different control and data relationships between nodes within a function. We also propose a Multi-Relational Nested Graph Convolutional Network (MRN-GCN) to process the MRNG. MRN-GCN first extracts and aggregates features from each MRFG, using the edge-enhanced graph convolution network and self-attention mechanism. The extracted feature vector is then assigned to the corresponding node in the MRNG to obtain a new Featured Contract Graph (FCG) for the smart contract. Graph convolution is used to further extract features from the FCG. Finally, a feed forward network with a Sigmoid function is used to locate the vulnerable functions. Experimental results on the real-world smart contract datasets show that model MRN-GCN can effectively improve the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score performance of vulnerable smart contract function locating.

> The design of codes for feedback-enabled communications has been a long-standing open problem. Recent research on non-linear, deep learning-based coding schemes have demonstrated significant improvements in communication reliability over linear codes, but are still vulnerable to the presence of forward and feedback noise over the channel. In this paper, we develop a new family of non-linear feedback codes that greatly enhance robustness to channel noise. Our autoencoder-based architecture is designed to learn codes based on consecutive blocks of bits, which obtains de-noising advantages over bit-by-bit processing to help overcome the physical separation between the encoder and decoder over a noisy channel. Moreover, we develop a power control layer at the encoder to explicitly incorporate hardware constraints into the learning optimization, and prove that the resulting average power constraint is satisfied asymptotically. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art feedback codes by wide margins over practical forward and feedback noise regimes, and provide information-theoretic insights on the behavior of our non-linear codes. Moreover, we observe that, in a long blocklength regime, canonical error correction codes are still preferable to feedback codes when the feedback noise becomes high.

> Recent studies have revealed that NLP predictive models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Most existing studies focused on designing attacks to evaluate the robustness of NLP models in the English language alone. Literature has seen an increasing need for NLP solutions for other languages. We, therefore, ask one natural question: whether state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods generalize to other languages. This paper investigates how to adapt SOTA adversarial attack algorithms in English to the Chinese language. Our experiments show that attack methods previously applied to English NLP can generate high-quality adversarial examples in Chinese when combined with proper text segmentation and linguistic constraints. In addition, we demonstrate that the generated adversarial examples can achieve high fluency and semantic consistency by focusing on the Chinese language's morphology and phonology, which in turn can be used to improve the adversarial robustness of Chinese NLP models.

> Recent studies have revealed that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Most existing robust graph learning methods measure model robustness based on label information, rendering them infeasible when label information is not available. A straightforward direction is to employ the widely used Infomax technique from typical Unsupervised Graph Representation Learning (UGRL) to learn robust unsupervised representations. Nonetheless, directly transplanting the Infomax technique from typical UGRL to robust UGRL may involve a biased assumption. In light of the limitation of Infomax, we propose a novel unbiased robust UGRL method called Robust Graph Information Bottleneck (RGIB), which is grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. Our RGIB attempts to learn robust node representations against adversarial perturbations by preserving the original information in the benign graph while eliminating the adversarial information in the adversarial graph. There are mainly two challenges to optimize RGIB: 1) high complexity of adversarial attack to perturb node features and graph structure jointly in the training procedure; 2) mutual information estimation upon adversarially attacked graphs. To tackle these problems, we further propose an efficient adversarial training strategy with only feature perturbations and an effective mutual information estimator with subgraph-level summary. Moreover, we theoretically establish a connection between our proposed RGIB and the robustness of downstream classifiers, revealing that RGIB can provide a lower bound on the adversarial risk of downstream classifiers. Extensive experiments over several benchmarks and downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

> Prior to November of 2022, the topic of synthetic media was largely buried within academic journals, constrained to conversations about national security, and often fundamentally misunderstood. The release of ChatGPT, however, has accelerated discourse on the societal impacts of synthetic media. This study first highlights several gaps within existing literature on synthetic media, structuring the impact potential and limitations of synthetic media threats within a theoretical framework. Second, it identifies financial information environments as prime candidates for future disruption via synthetic text modalities, proposing an experimental survey for measuring the influential power of synthetic financial text on global investment communities. Rather than merely assessing the ability of survey participants to distinguish genuine from synthetic text, the experiment contained within this study measures synthetic media influence by observing its ability to manipulate belief via a series of behavioral variables. The results indicate that synthetic text can significantly shift investor sentiment away from what it might otherwise have been under truthful information conditions. Furthermore, synthetic financial text demonstrated a unique ability to "convert" investors, inspiring extreme changes in outlook about a company compared to genuine financial texts. This trend should inspire concern within the global financial community, particularly given the historical vulnerability of equity markets to investor sentiment shocks.

> Smart contracts are blockchain programs that often handle valuable assets. Writing secure smart contracts is far from trivial, and any vulnerability may lead to significant financial losses. To support developers in identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities, methods and tools for the automated analysis have been proposed. However, the lack of commonly accepted benchmark suites and performance metrics makes it difficult to compare and evaluate such tools. Moreover, the tools are heterogeneous in their interfaces and reports as well as their runtime requirements, and installing several tools is time-consuming.   In this paper, we present SmartBugs 2.0, a modular execution framework. It provides a uniform interface to 19 tools aimed at smart contract analysis and accepts both Solidity source code and EVM bytecode as input. After describing its architecture, we highlight the features of the framework. We evaluate the framework via its reception by the community and illustrate its scalability by describing its role in a study involving 3.25 million analyses.

> Bug localization, which is used to help programmers identify the location of bugs in source code, is an essential task in software development. Researchers have already made efforts to harness the powerful deep learning (DL) techniques to automate it. However, training bug localization model is usually challenging because it requires a large quantity of data labeled with the bug's exact location, which is difficult and time-consuming to collect. By contrast, obtaining bug detection data with binary labels of whether there is a bug in the source code is much simpler. This paper proposes a WEakly supervised bug LocaLization (WELL) method, which only uses the bug detection data with binary labels to train a bug localization model. With CodeBERT finetuned on the buggy-or-not binary labeled data, WELL can address bug localization in a weakly supervised manner. The evaluations on three method-level synthetic datasets and one file-level real-world dataset show that WELL is significantly better than the existing SOTA model in typical bug localization tasks such as variable misuse and other programming bugs.

> Many advanced program analysis and verification methods are based on solving systems of Constrained Horn Clauses (CHC). Testing CHC solvers is very important, as correctness of their work determines whether bugs in the analyzed programs are detected or missed. One of the well-established and efficient methods of automated software testing is fuzzing: analyzing the reactions of programs to random input data. Currently, there are no fuzzers for CHC solvers, and fuzzers for SMT solvers are not efficient in CHC solver testing, since they do not consider CHC specifics. In this paper, we present HornFuzz, a mutation-based gray-box fuzzing technique for detecting bugs in CHC solvers based on the idea of metamorphic testing. We evaluated our fuzzer on one of the highest performing CHC solvers, Spacer, and found a handful of bugs in Spacer. In particular, some discovered problems are so serious that they require fixes with significant changes to the solver.

> Intelligent systems that aim at mastering language as humans do must deal with its semantic underspecification, namely, the possibility for a linguistic signal to convey only part of the information needed for communication to succeed. Consider the usages of the pronoun they, which can leave the gender and number of its referent(s) underspecified. Semantic underspecification is not a bug but a crucial language feature that boosts its storage and processing efficiency. Indeed, human speakers can quickly and effortlessly integrate semantically-underspecified linguistic signals with a wide range of non-linguistic information, e.g., the multimodal context, social or cultural conventions, and shared knowledge. Standard NLP models have, in principle, no or limited access to such extra information, while multimodal systems grounding language into other modalities, such as vision, are naturally equipped to account for this phenomenon. However, we show that they struggle with it, which could negatively affect their performance and lead to harmful consequences when used for applications. In this position paper, we argue that our community should be aware of semantic underspecification if it aims to develop language technology that can successfully interact with human users. We discuss some applications where mastering it is crucial and outline a few directions toward achieving this goal.

> Fixing software bugs and adding new features are two of the major maintenance tasks. Software bugs and features are reported as change requests. Developers consult these requests and often choose a few keywords from them as an ad hoc query. Then they execute the query with a search engine to find the exact locations within software code that need to be changed. Unfortunately, even experienced developers often fail to choose appropriate queries, which leads to costly trials and errors during a code search. Over the years, many studies attempt to reformulate the ad hoc queries from developers to support them. In this systematic literature review, we carefully select 70 primary studies on query reformulations from 2,970 candidate studies, perform an in-depth qualitative analysis (e.g., Grounded Theory), and then answer seven research questions with major findings. First, to date, eight major methodologies (e.g., term weighting, term co-occurrence analysis, thesaurus lookup) have been adopted to reformulate queries. Second, the existing studies suffer from several major limitations (e.g., lack of generalizability, vocabulary mismatch problem, subjective bias) that might prevent their wide adoption. Finally, we discuss the best practices and future opportunities to advance the state of research in search query reformulations.

Due to their increase in demand, addressing security vulnerabilities to both UAVs and the Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANET) they form is more important than ever. As the network traffic is communicated through open airwaves, this network of UAVs relies on monitoring applications known as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect and mitigate attacks. This paper will survey current IDS systems that include machine learning techniques when combating various vulnerabilities and attacks from bad actors. This paper will be concluded with research challenges and future research directions in finding an effective IDS system that can handle cyber-attacks while meeting performance requirements.

> Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been widely applied in many fields such as smart traffic and unmanned aerial vehicles. However, most MARL algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on agent states. Robustness testing for a trained model is an essential step for confirming the trustworthiness of the model against unexpected perturbations. This work proposes a novel Robustness Testing framework for MARL that attacks states of Critical Agents (RTCA). The RTCA has two innovations: 1) a Differential Evolution (DE) based method to select critical agents as victims and to advise the worst-case joint actions on them; and 2) a team cooperation policy evaluation method employed as the objective function for the optimization of DE. Then, adversarial state perturbations of the critical agents are generated based on the worst-case joint actions. This is the first robustness testing framework with varying victim agents. RTCA demonstrates outstanding performance in terms of the number of victim agents and destroying cooperation policies.

As the market expands, the current sneaker scene displays several vulnerabilities and trust flaws, mostly related to the legitimacy of assets or actors. In this paper, we investigate various blockchain-based mechanisms to address these large-scale trust issues. We argue that (i) pre-certified and tracked assets through the use of non-fungible tokens can ensure the genuine nature of an asset and authenticate its owner more effectively during peer-to-peer trading across a marketplace; (ii) a game-theoretic-based system with economic incentives for participating users can greatly reduce the rate of online fraud and address missed delivery deadlines; (iii) a decentralized dispute resolution system biased in favour of an honest party can solve potential conflicts more reliably.

> Pre-training a large transformer model on a massive amount of unlabeled data and fine-tuning it on labeled datasets for diverse downstream tasks has proven to be a successful strategy, for a variety of vision and natural language processing tasks. However, direct fine-tuning of the pre-trained model may be suboptimal if there exist large discrepancies across data domains for pre-training and fine-tuning. To tackle this issue, several previous studies have proposed further pre-training strategies, where we continue to pre-train the model on the target unlabeled dataset before fine-tuning. However, all of them solely focus on language models and we empirically find that a Vision Transformer is vulnerable to overfitting as we continue to pretrain the model on target unlabeled data. In order to tackle this limitation, we propose self-distillation as a regularization for a further pre-training stage. Specifically, we first further pre-train the initial pre-trained model on the target unlabeled data and then consider it as a teacher for self-distillation. Then we take the same initial pre-trained model as a student and enforce its hidden representations to be close to those of the teacher while optimizing the student with a masked auto-encoding objective. We empirically validate the efficacy of self-distillation on a variety of benchmark datasets for image and text classification tasks. Experimentally, we show that our proposed method outperforms all the relevant baselines. Theoretically, we analyze the proposed method with a simplified model to understand how self-distillation for further pre-training can potentially help improve the performance of the downstream tasks.

This paper proposes a methodology for developing and evaluating ChatGPT detectors for French text, with a focus on investigating their robustness on out-of-domain data and against common attack schemes. The proposed method involves translating an English dataset into French and training a classifier on the translated data. Results show that the detectors can effectively detect ChatGPT-generated text, with a degree of robustness against basic attack techniques in in-domain settings. However, vulnerabilities are evident in out-of-domain contexts, highlighting the challenge of detecting adversarial text.

> Industrial applications heavily integrate open-source software libraries nowadays. Beyond the benefits that libraries bring, they can also impose a real threat in case a library is affected by a vulnerability but its community is not active in creating a fixing release. Therefore, I want to introduce an automatic monitoring approach for industrial applications to identify open-source dependencies that show negative signs regarding their current or future maintenance activities. Since most research in this field is limited due to lack of features, labels, and transitive links, and thus is not applicable in industry, my approach aims to close this gap by capturing the impact of direct and transitive dependencies in terms of their maintenance activities. Automatically monitoring the maintenance activities of dependencies reduces the manual effort of application maintainers and supports application security by continuously having well-maintained dependencies.

> Large language models (LLMs) have become mainstream technology with their versatile use cases and impressive performance. Despite the countless out-of-the-box applications, LLMs are still not reliable. A lot of work is being done to improve the factual accuracy, consistency, and ethical standards of these models through fine-tuning, prompting, and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), but no systematic analysis of the responses of these models to different categories of statements, or on their potential vulnerabilities to simple prompting changes is available. In this work, we analyze what confuses GPT-3: how the model responds to certain sensitive topics and what effects the prompt wording has on the model response. We find that GPT-3 correctly disagrees with obvious Conspiracies and Stereotypes but makes mistakes with common Misconceptions and Controversies. The model responses are inconsistent across prompts and settings, highlighting GPT-3's unreliability.

> Gradient inversion attack enables recovery of training samples from model gradients in federated learning (FL), and constitutes a serious threat to data privacy. To mitigate this vulnerability, prior work proposed both principled defenses based on differential privacy, as well as heuristic defenses based on gradient compression as countermeasures. These defenses have so far been very effective, in particular those based on gradient compression that allow the model to maintain high accuracy while greatly reducing the effectiveness of attacks. In this work, we argue that such findings underestimate the privacy risk in FL. As a counterexample, we show that existing defenses can be broken by a simple adaptive attack, where a model trained on auxiliary data is able to invert gradients on both vision and language tasks.

> Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become widely used in various fields like environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and health care. However, their extensive usage also introduces significant vulnerabilities to cyber viruses. Addressing this security issue in WSNs is very challenging due to their inherent limitations in energy and bandwidth to implement real-time security measures. To tackle the virus issue, it is crucial to first understand how it spreads in WSNs. In this brief, we propose a novel epidemic spreading model for WSNs, integrating the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic spreading model and node probabilistic sleep scheduling--a critical mechanism for optimizing energy efficiency. Using the microscopic Markov chain (MMC) method, we derive the spreading equations and epidemic threshold of our model. We conduct numerical simulations to validate the theoretical results and investigate the impact of key factors on epidemic spreading in WSNs. Notably, we discover that the epidemic threshold is directly proportional to the ratio of node sleeping and node activation probabilities.

> Federated learning (FL) has enabled training machine learning models exploiting the data of multiple agents without compromising privacy. However, FL is known to be vulnerable to data heterogeneity, partial device participation, and infrequent communication with the server, which are nonetheless three distinctive characteristics of this framework. While much of the recent literature has tackled these weaknesses using different tools, only a few works have explored the possibility of exploiting inter-agent communication to improve FL's performance. In this work, we present FedDec, an algorithm that interleaves peer-to-peer communication and parameter averaging (similar to decentralized learning in networks) between the local gradient updates of FL. We analyze the convergence of FedDec under the assumptions of non-iid data distribution, partial device participation, and smooth and strongly convex costs, and show that inter-agent communication alleviates the negative impact of infrequent communication rounds with the server by reducing the dependence on the number of local updates $H$ from $O(H^2)$ to $O(H)$. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the term improved in the bound is multiplied by a constant that depends on the spectrum of the inter-agent communication graph, and that vanishes quickly the more connected the network is. We confirm the predictions of our theory in numerical simulations, where we show that FedDec converges faster than FedAvg, and that the gains are greater as either $H$ or the connectivity of the network increase.

> With rich visual data, such as images, becoming readily associated with items, visually-aware recommendation systems (VARS) have been widely used in different applications. Recent studies have shown that VARS are vulnerable to item-image adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the clean images associated with those items. Attacks on VARS pose new security challenges to a wide range of applications such as e-Commerce and social networks where VARS are widely used. How to secure VARS from such adversarial attacks becomes a critical problem. Currently, there is still a lack of systematic study on how to design secure defense strategies against visual attacks on VARS. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by proposing an adversarial image reconstruction and detection framework to secure VARS. Our proposed method can simultaneously (1) secure VARS from adversarial attacks characterized by local perturbations by image reconstruction based on global vision transformers; and (2) accurately detect adversarial examples using a novel contrastive learning approach. Meanwhile, our framework is designed to be used as both a filter and a detector so that they can be jointly trained to improve the flexibility of our defense strategy to a variety of attacks and VARS models. We have conducted extensive experimental studies with two popular attack methods (FGSM and PGD). Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our defense strategy against visual attacks is effective and outperforms existing methods on different attacks. Moreover, our method can detect adversarial examples with high accuracy.

> Real-world programs expecting structured inputs often has a format-parsing stage gating the deeper program space. Neither a mutation-based approach nor a generative approach can provide a solution that is effective and scalable. Large language models (LLM) pre-trained with an enormous amount of natural language corpus have proved to be effective for understanding the implicit format syntax and generating format-conforming inputs. In this paper, propose ChatFuzz, a greybox fuzzer augmented by generative AI. More specifically, we pick a seed in the fuzzer's seed pool and prompt ChatGPT generative models to variations, which are more likely to be format-conforming and thus of high quality. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the best practice for harvesting the power of generative LLM models. The experiment results show that our approach improves the edge coverage by 12.77\% over the SOTA greybox fuzzer (AFL++) on 12 target programs from three well-tested benchmarks. As for vulnerability detection, \sys is able to perform similar to or better than AFL++ for programs with explicit syntax rules but not for programs with non-trivial syntax.

> While speech-enabled teachable agents have some advantages over typing-based ones, they are vulnerable to errors stemming from misrecognition by automatic speech recognition (ASR). These errors may propagate, resulting in unexpected changes in the flow of conversation. We analyzed how such changes are linked with learning gains and learners' rapport with the agents. Our results show they are not related to learning gains or rapport, regardless of the types of responses the agents should have returned given the correct input from learners without ASR errors. We also discuss the implications for optimal error-recovery policies for teachable agents that can be drawn from these findings.

> Smart contracts are pieces of code that reside inside the blockchains and can be triggered to execute any transaction when specifically predefined conditions are satisfied. Being commonly used for commercial transactions in blockchain makes the security of smart contracts particularly important. Over the last few years, we have seen a great deal of academic and practical interest in detecting and fixing the bugs in smart contracts written by Solidity. But little is known about the real bug fixes in Solidity smart contract projects. To understand the bug fixes and enrich the knowledge of bug fixes in real-world projects, we conduct an empirical study on historical bug fixes from 46 real-world Solidity smart contract projects in this paper. We provide a multi-faceted discussion and mainly explore the following four questions: File Type and Amount, Fix Complexity, Bug distribution, and Fix Patches. We distill four findings during the process to explore these four questions. Finally, based on these findings, we provide actionable implications to improve the current approaches to fixing bugs in Solidity smart contracts from three aspects: Automatic repair techniques, Analysis tools, and Solidity developers.

> Reusing off-the-shelf code snippets from online repositories is a common practice, which significantly enhances the productivity of software developers. To find desired code snippets, developers resort to code search engines through natural language queries. Neural code search models are hence behind many such engines. These models are based on deep learning and gain substantial attention due to their impressive performance. However, the security aspect of these models is rarely studied. Particularly, an adversary can inject a backdoor in neural code search models, which return buggy or even vulnerable code with security/privacy issues. This may impact the downstream software (e.g., stock trading systems and autonomous driving) and cause financial loss and/or life-threatening incidents. In this paper, we demonstrate such attacks are feasible and can be quite stealthy. By simply modifying one variable/function name, the attacker can make buggy/vulnerable code rank in the top 11%. Our attack BADCODE features a special trigger generation and injection procedure, making the attack more effective and stealthy. The evaluation is conducted on two neural code search models and the results show our attack outperforms baselines by 60%. Our user study demonstrates that our attack is more stealthy than the baseline by two times based on the F1 score.

> Prior studies generally focus on software vulnerability detection and have demonstrated the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches for the task. Considering the various types of software vulnerabilities and the associated different degrees of severity, it is also beneficial to determine the type of each vulnerable code for developers. In this paper, we observe that the distribution of vulnerability type is long-tailed in practice, where a small portion of classes have massive samples (i.e., head classes) but the others contain only a few samples (i.e., tail classes). Directly adopting previous vulnerability detection approaches tends to result in poor detection performance, mainly due to two reasons. First, it is difficult to effectively learn the vulnerability representation due to the over-smoothing issue of GNNs. Second, vulnerability types in tails are hard to be predicted due to the extremely few associated samples.To alleviate these issues, we propose a Long-taIled software VulnerABiLity typE classification approach, called LIVABLE. LIVABLE mainly consists of two modules, including (1) vulnerability representation learning module, which improves the propagation steps in GNN to distinguish node representations by a differentiated propagation method. A sequence-to-sequence model is also involved to enhance the vulnerability representations. (2) adaptive re-weighting module, which adjusts the learning weights for different types according to the training epochs and numbers of associated samples by a novel training loss.

> Crowdsourced testing, as a distinct testing paradigm, has attracted much attention in software testing, especially in mobile application (app) testing field. Compared with in-house testing, crowdsourced testing shows superiority with the diverse testing environments when faced with the mobile testing fragmentation problem. However, crowdsourced testing also encounters the low-quality test report problem caused by unprofessional crowdworkers involved with different expertise. In order to handle the submitted reports of uneven quality, app developers have to distinguish high-quality reports from low-quality ones to help the bug inspection. One kind of typical low-quality test report is inconsistent test reports, which means the textual descriptions are not focusing on the attached bug-occurring screenshots. According to our empirical survey, only 18.07% crowdsourced test reports are consistent. Inconsistent reports cause waste on mobile app testing.   To solve the inconsistency problem, we propose ReCoDe to detect the consistency of crowdsourced test reports via deep image-and-text fusion understanding. ReCoDe is a two-stage approach that first classifies the reports based on textual descriptions into different categories according to the bug feature. In the second stage, ReCoDe has a deep understanding of the GUI image features of the app screenshots and then applies different strategies to handle different types of bugs to detect the consistency of the crowdsourced test reports. We conduct an experiment on a dataset with over 22k test reports to evaluate ReCoDe, and the results show the effectiveness of ReCoDe in detecting the consistency of crowdsourced test reports. Besides, a user study is conducted to prove the practical value of ReCoDe in effectively helping app developers improve the efficiency of reviewing the crowdsourced test reports.

> While text-based machine learning models that operate on visual inputs of rendered text have become robust against a wide range of existing attacks, we show that they are still vulnerable to visual adversarial examples encoded as text. We use the Unicode functionality of combining diacritical marks to manipulate encoded text so that small visual perturbations appear when the text is rendered. We show how a genetic algorithm can be used to generate visual adversarial examples in a black-box setting, and conduct a user study to establish that the model-fooling adversarial examples do not affect human comprehension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks in the real world by creating adversarial examples against production models published by Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, and Google.

> Tensor data analysis allows researchers to uncover novel patterns and relationships that cannot be obtained from matrix data alone. The information inferred from the patterns provides valuable insights into disease progression, bioproduction processes, weather fluctuations, and group dynamics. However, spurious and redundant patterns hamper this process. This work aims at proposing a statistical frame to assess the probability of patterns in tensor data to deviate from null expectations, extending well-established principles for assessing the statistical significance of patterns in matrix data. A comprehensive discussion on binomial testing for false positive discoveries is entailed at the light of: variable dependencies, temporal dependencies and misalignments, and \textit{p}-value corrections under the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Results gathered from the application of state-of-the-art triclustering algorithms over distinct real-world case studies in biochemical and biotechnological domains confer validity to the proposed statistical frame while revealing vulnerabilities of some triclustering searches. The proposed assessment can be incorporated into existing triclustering algorithms to mitigate false positive/spurious discoveries and further prune the search space, reducing their computational complexity.

> Deep learning models often face challenges when handling real-world image corruptions. In response, researchers have developed image corruption datasets to evaluate the performance of deep neural networks in handling such corruptions. However, these datasets have a significant limitation: they do not account for all corruptions encountered in real-life scenarios. To address this gap, we present MUFIA (Multiplicative Filter Attack), an algorithm designed to identify the specific types of corruptions that can cause models to fail. Our algorithm identifies the combination of image frequency components that render a model susceptible to misclassification while preserving the semantic similarity to the original image. We find that even state-of-the-art models trained to be robust against known common corruptions struggle against the low visibility-based corruptions crafted by MUFIA. This highlights the need for more comprehensive approaches to enhance model robustness against a wider range of real-world image corruptions.

> Recently, neural networks have spread into numerous fields including many safety-critical systems. Neural networks are built (and trained) by programming in frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Developers apply a rich set of pre-defined layers to manually program neural networks or to automatically generate them (e.g., through AutoML). Composing neural networks with different layers is error-prone due to the non-trivial constraints that must be satisfied in order to use those layers. In this work, we propose an approach to automatically repair erroneous neural networks. The challenge is in identifying a minimal modification to the network so that it becomes valid. Modifying a layer might have cascading effects on subsequent layers and thus our approach must search recursively to identify a "globally" minimal modification. Our approach is based on an executable semantics of deep learning layers and focuses on four kinds of errors which are common in practice. We evaluate our approach for two usage scenarios, i.e., repairing automatically generated neural networks and manually written ones suffering from common model bugs. The results show that we are able to repair 100% of a set of randomly generated neural networks (which are produced with an existing AI framework testing approach) effectively and efficiently (with an average repair time of 21.08s) and 93.75% of a collection of real neural network bugs (with an average time of 3min 40s).

> Vulnerabilities are challenging to locate and repair, especially when source code is unavailable and binary patching is required. Manual methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially Recompilable Decompilation (PRD). PRD lifts suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically work on an entire binary, our approach succeeds because it is limited to a few functions, like those identified by our binary fault localization.   We evaluate these assumptions and find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, 70-89% of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled with sufficient type recovery. In comparison, only 1.7% of the full C-binaries succeed. When decompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 92.9% of the time.   In addition, we evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating only on binaries, performs as well as, and sometimes better than full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a success rate consistent with these same tools operating with access to the entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those produced by top CGC teams. For generality, our evaluation includes two independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world binaries.

The applications in consideration are Portfolio Optimization, Fraud Detection, and Monte Carlo methods for derivative pricing and risk calculation. Furthermore, we give a comprehensive overview of the applications of quantum computing in the field of blockchain technology which is a main concept in fintech. In that sense, we first introduce the general overview of blockchain with its main cryptographic primitives such as digital signature algorithms, hash functions, and random number generators as well as the security vulnerabilities of blockchain technologies after the merge of quantum computers considering Shor's quantum factoring and Grover's quantum search algorithms. We then discuss the privacy preserving quantum-resistant blockchain systems via threshold signatures, ring signatures, and zero-knowledge proof systems i.e. ZK-SNARKs in quantum resistant blockchains. After emphasizing the difference between the quantum-resistant blockchain and quantum-safe blockchain we mention the security countermeasures to take against the possible quantumized attacks aiming these systems. We finalize our discussion with quantum blockchain, efficient quantum mining and necessary infrastructures for constructing such systems based on quantum computing. This review has the intention to be a bridge to fill the gap between quantum computing and one of its most prominent application realms: Finance. We provide the state-of-the-art results in the intersection of finance and quantum technology for both industrial practitioners and academicians.

> Most existing pre-trained language models for source code focus on learning the static code text, typically augmented with static code structures (abstract syntax tree, dependency graphs, etc.). However, program semantics will not be fully exposed before the real execution. Without an understanding of the program execution, statically pre-trained models fail to comprehensively capture the dynamic code properties, such as the branch coverage and the runtime variable values, and they are consequently less effective at code understanding tasks, such as retrieving semantic clones and detecting software vulnerabilities.   To close the gap between the static nature of language models and the dynamic characteristics of programs, we introduce TRACED, an execution-aware pre-training strategy for source code. Specifically, we pre-train code language models with a combination of source code, executable inputs, and corresponding execution traces. Our goal is to teach code models the complicated execution logic during the pre-training, enabling the model to statically estimate the dynamic code properties without repeatedly executing code during task-specific fine-tuning.   To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we fine-tune and evaluate TRACED on three downstream tasks: static execution estimation, clone retrieval, and vulnerability detection. The empirical results show that TRACED relatively improves the statically pre-trained code models by 12.4% for complete execution path prediction and by 25.2% for runtime variable value predictions. TRACED also significantly outperforms statically pre-trained models in clone retrieval and vulnerability detection across four public benchmarks.

> This paper studies speculative reasoning task on real-world knowledge graphs (KG) that contain both \textit{false negative issue} (i.e., potential true facts being excluded) and \textit{false positive issue} (i.e., unreliable or outdated facts being included). State-of-the-art methods fall short in the speculative reasoning ability, as they assume the correctness of a fact is solely determined by its presence in KG, making them vulnerable to false negative/positive issues. The new reasoning task is formulated as a noisy Positive-Unlabeled learning problem. We propose a variational framework, namely nPUGraph, that jointly estimates the correctness of both collected and uncollected facts (which we call \textit{label posterior}) and updates model parameters during training. The label posterior estimation facilitates speculative reasoning from two perspectives. First, it improves the robustness of a label posterior-aware graph encoder against false positive links. Second, it identifies missing facts to provide high-quality grounds of reasoning. They are unified in a simple yet effective self-training procedure. Empirically, extensive experiments on three benchmark KG and one Twitter dataset with various degrees of false negative/positive cases demonstrate the effectiveness of nPUGraph.

> An efficient operation of the electric shared mobility system (ESMS) relies heavily on seamless interconnections among shared electric vehicles (SEV), electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), and the grid. Nevertheless, this interconnectivity also makes the ESMS vulnerable to cyberattacks that may cause short-term breakdowns or long-term degradation of the ESMS. This study focuses on one such attack with long-lasting effects, the Delayed Charge Attack (DCA), that stealthily delays the charging service by exploiting the physical and communication vulnerabilities. To begin, we present the ESMS threat model by highlighting the assets, information flow, and access points. We next identify a linked sequence of vulnerabilities as a viable attack vector for launching DCA. Then, we detail the implementation of DCA, which can effectively bypass the detection in the SEV's battery management system and the cross-verification in the cloud environment. We test the DCA model against various Anomaly Detection (AD) algorithms by simulating the DCA dynamics in a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed-Susceptible process, where the EVSE can be compromised by the DCA or detected for repair. Using real-world taxi trip data and EVSE locations in New York City, the DCA model allows us to explore the long-term impacts and validate the system consequences. The results show that a 10-min delay results in 12-min longer queuing times and 8% more unfulfilled requests, leading to a 10.7% (\$311.7) weekly revenue loss per driver. With the AD algorithms, the weekly revenue loss remains at least 3.8% (\$111.8) with increased repair costs of \$36,000, suggesting the DCA's robustness against the AD.

> In organizations, employees work with information stored in files according to their duties and responsibilities. Windows uses resource-based access permissions that any permission for any user has to be set separately per resource. This approach gets complicated as the number of resources and users increase, and causes oversights in assigning permissions. Therefore, a special mechanism is required to scrutinize what permissions any employee has on any set of resources. This requirement is circumvented by reversing the Windows approach in terms of user-accessible resources. This approach is implemented by a program allowing quick and easy examination of any type of permissions granted or denied to active directory users on any folder. In this way, administrators can make sure there is no any missing or overlooked setting that could cause a security vulnerability. This approach can easily be extended to scrutinize other resources, and for other local or active directory objects.

> Since 2014, artificial neural networks have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can fool the network into producing wrong or nonsensical outputs by making humanly imperceptible alterations to inputs. While defenses against adversarial attacks have been proposed, they usually involve retraining a new neural network from scratch, a costly task. In this work, I introduce the Finite Gaussian Neuron (FGN), a novel neuron architecture for artificial neural networks. My works aims to: - easily convert existing models to Finite Gaussian Neuron architecture, - while preserving the existing model's behavior on real data, - and offering resistance against adversarial attacks. I show that converted and retrained Finite Gaussian Neural Networks (FGNN) always have lower confidence (i.e., are not overconfident) in their predictions over randomized and Fast Gradient Sign Method adversarial images when compared to classical neural networks, while maintaining high accuracy and confidence over real MNIST images. To further validate the capacity of Finite Gaussian Neurons to protect from adversarial attacks, I compare the behavior of FGNs to that of Bayesian Neural Networks against both randomized and adversarial images, and show how the behavior of the two architectures differs. Finally I show some limitations of the FGN models by testing them on the more complex SPEECHCOMMANDS task, against the stronger Carlini-Wagner and Projected Gradient Descent adversarial attacks.

> Neural network-based image classifiers are powerful tools for computer vision tasks, but they inadvertently reveal sensitive attribute information about their classes, raising concerns about their privacy. To investigate this privacy leakage, we introduce the first Class Attribute Inference Attack (CAIA), which leverages recent advances in text-to-image synthesis to infer sensitive attributes of individual classes in a black-box setting, while remaining competitive with related white-box attacks. Our extensive experiments in the face recognition domain show that CAIA can accurately infer undisclosed sensitive attributes, such as an individual's hair color, gender, and racial appearance, which are not part of the training labels. Interestingly, we demonstrate that adversarial robust models are even more vulnerable to such privacy leakage than standard models, indicating that a trade-off between robustness and privacy exists.

> Overlapping frequently occurs in paired texts in natural language processing tasks like text editing and semantic similarity evaluation. Better evaluation of the semantic distance between the overlapped sentences benefits the language system's understanding and guides the generation. Since conventional semantic metrics are based on word representations, they are vulnerable to the disturbance of overlapped components with similar representations. This paper aims to address the issue with a mask-and-predict strategy. We take the words in the longest common sequence (LCS) as neighboring words and use masked language modeling (MLM) from pre-trained language models (PLMs) to predict the distributions on their positions. Our metric, Neighboring Distribution Divergence (NDD), represent the semantic distance by calculating the divergence between distributions in the overlapped parts. Experiments on Semantic Textual Similarity show NDD to be more sensitive to various semantic differences, especially on highly overlapped paired texts. Based on the discovery, we further implement an unsupervised and training-free method for text compression, leading to a significant improvement on the previous perplexity-based method. The high scalability of our method even enables NDD to outperform the supervised state-of-the-art in domain adaption by a huge margin. Further experiments on syntax and semantics analyses verify the awareness of internal sentence structures, indicating the high potential of NDD for further studies.

- `2306.06686v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06686v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06686v2)

> This paper tackles the fundamental passive eavesdropping problem in modern wireless communications in which the location and the channel state information (CSI) of the attackers are unknown. In this regard, we propose deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to help ground base station (GBS) support a subset of vulnerable users. More precisely, our solution (1) clusters the single-antenna users in two groups to be either served by the GBS directly or via the AR, (2) employs optimal multi-user beamforming to the directly served users, and (3) optimizes the AR's 3D position, its multi-user beamforming matrix and transmit powers by combining closed-form solutions with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we design a plain beamforming and power optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for an AR to optimize its trajectory for the security maximization of the served users. Numerical results show that the multi-user multiple input, single output (MU-MISO) system split between a GBS and an AR with optimized transmission parameters without knowledge of the eavesdropping channels achieves high secrecy capacities that scale well with increasing the number of users.

> Mobile applications, particularly those from social media platforms such as WeChat and TikTok, are evolving into "super apps" that offer a wide range of services such as instant messaging and media sharing, e-commerce, e-learning, and e-government. These super apps often provide APIs for developers to create "miniapps" that run within the super app. These APIs should have been thoroughly scrutinized for security. Unfortunately, we find that many of them are undocumented and unsecured, potentially allowing miniapps to bypass restrictions and gain higher privileged access. To systematically identify these hidden APIs before they are exploited by attackers, we developed a tool APIScope with both static analysis and dynamic analysis, where static analysis is used to recognize hidden undocumented APIs, and dynamic analysis is used to confirm whether the identified APIs can be invoked by an unprivileged 3rdparty miniapps. We have applied APIScope to five popular super apps (i.e., WeChat, WeCom, Baidu, QQ, and Tiktok) and found that all of them contain hidden APIs, many of which can be exploited due to missing security checks. We have also quantified the hidden APIs that may have security implications by verifying if they have access to resources protected by Android permissions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential security hazards by presenting various attack scenarios, including unauthorized access to any web pages, downloading and installing malicious software, and stealing sensitive information. We have reported our findings to the relevant vendors, some of whom have patched the vulnerabilities and rewarded us with bug bounties.

> Mobile mini-programs in WeChat have gained significant popularity since their debut in 2017, reaching a scale similar to that of Android apps in the Play Store. Like Google, Tencent, the provider of WeChat, offers APIs to support the development of mini-programs and also maintains a mini-program market within the WeChat app. However, mini-program APIs often manage sensitive user data within the social network platform, both on the WeChat client app and in the cloud. As a result, cryptographic protocols have been implemented to secure data access. In this paper, we demonstrate that WeChat should have required the use of the "appsecret" master key, which is used to authenticate a mini-program, to be used only in the mini-program back-end. If this key is leaked in the front-end of the mini-programs, it can lead to catastrophic attacks on both mini-program developers and users. Using a mini-program crawler and a master key leakage inspector, we measured 3,450,586 crawled mini-programs and found that 40,880 of them had leaked their master keys, allowing attackers to carry out various attacks such as account hijacking, promotion abuse, and service theft. Similar issues were confirmed through testing and measuring of Baidu mini-programs too. We have reported these vulnerabilities and the list of vulnerable mini-programs to Tencent and Baidu, which awarded us with bug bounties, and also Tencent recently released a new API to defend against these attacks based on our findings.

> Although the prevention of AI vulnerabilities is critical to preserve the safety and privacy of users and businesses, educational tools for robust AI are still underdeveloped worldwide. We present the design, implementation, and assessment of Maestro. Maestro is an effective open-source game-based platform that contributes to the advancement of robust AI education. Maestro provides goal-based scenarios where college students are exposed to challenging life-inspired assignments in a competitive programming environment. We assessed Maestro's influence on students' engagement, motivation, and learning success in robust AI. This work also provides insights into the design features of online learning tools that promote active learning opportunities in the robust AI domain. We analyzed the reflection responses (measured with Likert scales) of 147 undergraduate students using Maestro in two quarterly college courses in AI. According to the results, students who felt the acquisition of new skills in robust AI tended to appreciate highly Maestro and scored highly on material consolidation, curiosity, and mastery in robust AI. Moreover, the leaderboard, our key gamification element in Maestro, has effectively contributed to students' engagement and learning. Results also indicate that Maestro can be effectively adapted to any course length and depth without losing its educational quality.

> The function or performance of a network is strongly dependent on its robustness, quantifying the ability of the network to continue functioning under perturbations. While a wide variety of robustness metrics have been proposed, they have their respective limitations. In this paper, we propose to use the forest index as a measure of network robustness, which overcomes the deficiencies of existing metrics. Using such a measure as an optimization criterion, we propose and study the problem of breaking down a network by attacking some key edges. We show that the objective function of the problem is monotonic but not submodular, which impose more challenging on the problem. We thus resort to greedy algorithms extended for non-submodular functions by iteratively deleting the most promising edges. We first propose a simple greedy algorithm with a proved bound for the approximation ratio and cubic-time complexity. To confront the computation challenge for large networks, we further propose an improved nearly-linear time greedy algorithm, which significantly speeds up the process for edge selection but sacrifices little accuracy. Extensive experimental results for a large set of real-world networks verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, demonstrating that our algorithms outperform several baseline schemes.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in modeling graph-structured data. However, recent works show that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can fool the GNN model to make desired predictions of the attacker. In addition, training data of GNNs can be leaked under membership inference attacks. This largely hinders the adoption of GNNs in high-stake domains such as e-commerce, finance and bioinformatics. Though investigations have been made in conducting robust predictions and protecting membership privacy, they generally fail to simultaneously consider the robustness and membership privacy. Therefore, in this work, we study a novel problem of developing robust and membership privacy-preserving GNNs. Our analysis shows that Information Bottleneck (IB) can help filter out noisy information and regularize the predictions on labeled samples, which can benefit robustness and membership privacy. However, structural noises and lack of labels in node classification challenge the deployment of IB on graph-structured data. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel graph information bottleneck framework that can alleviate structural noises with neighbor bottleneck. Pseudo labels are also incorporated in the optimization to minimize the gap between the predictions on the labeled set and unlabeled set for membership privacy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can give robust predictions and simultaneously preserve membership privacy.

> Cyberattacks on industrial control systems (ICS) have been drawing attention in academia. However, this has not raised adequate concerns among some industrial practitioners. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the vulnerable locations and components in the ICS and investigate the attack scenarios and techniques. This study proposes a method to assess the risk of cyberattacks on ICS with an improved Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and applies it to a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model. The results show the physical system levels of ICS have the highest severity once cyberattacked, and controllers, workstations, and human-machine interface are the crucial components in the cyberattack and defense.

> R and Python are among the most popular languages used in many critical data analytics tasks. However, we still do not fully understand the capabilities of these two languages w.r.t. bugs encountered in data analytics tasks. What type of bugs are common? What are the main root causes? What is the relation between bugs and root causes? How to mitigate these bugs? We present a comprehensive study of 5,068 Stack Overflow posts, 1,800 bug fix commits from GitHub repositories, and several GitHub issues of the most used libraries to understand bugs in R and Python. Our key findings include: while both R and Python have bugs due to inexperience with data analysis, Python see significantly larger data preprocessing bugs compared to R. Developers experience significantly more data flow bugs in R because intermediate results are often implicit. We also found changes and bugs in packages and libraries cause more bugs in R compared to Python while package or library misselection and conflicts cause more bugs in Python than R. While R has a slightly higher readability barrier for data analysts, the statistical power of R leads to a less number of bad performance bugs. In terms of data visualization, R packages have significantly more bugs than Python libraries. We also identified a strong correlation between comparable packages in R and Python despite their linguistic and methodological differences. Lastly, we contribute a large dataset of manually verified R and Python bugs.

> We study the problem of finding incorrect property accesses in JavaScript where objects do not have a fixed layout, and properties (including methods) can be added, overwritten, and deleted freely throughout the lifetime of an object. Since referencing a non-existent property is not an error in JavaScript, accidental accesses to non-existent properties (caused, perhaps, by a typo or by a misunderstanding of API documentation) can go undetected without thorough testing, and may manifest far from the source of the problem. We propose a two-phase approach for detecting property access errors based on the observation that, in practice, most property accesses will be correct. First a large number of property access patterns is collected from an extensive corpus of real-world JavaScript code, and a statistical analysis is performed to identify anomalous usage patterns. Specific instances of these patterns may not be bugs (due, e.g., dynamic type checks), so a local data-flow analysis filters out instances of anomalous property accesses that are safe and leaves only those likely to be actual bugs. We experimentally validate our approach, showing that on a set of 100 concrete instances of anomalous property accesses, the approach achieves a precision of 82% with a recall of 90%, making it suitable for practical use. We also conducted an experiment to determine how effective the popular VSCode code completion feature is at suggesting object properties, and found that, while it never suggested an incorrect property (precision of 100%), it failed to suggest the correct property in 62 out of 80 cases (recall of 22.5%). This shows that developers cannot rely on VSCode's code completion alone to ensure that all property accesses are valid.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one of the most popular research topics for deep learning. GNN methods typically have been designed on top of the graph signal processing theory. In particular, diffusion equations have been widely used for designing the core processing layer of GNNs, and therefore they are inevitably vulnerable to the notorious oversmoothing problem. Recently, a couple of papers paid attention to reaction equations in conjunctions with diffusion equations. However, they all consider limited forms of reaction equations. To this end, we present a reaction-diffusion equation-based GNN method that considers all popular types of reaction equations in addition to one special reaction equation designed by us. To our knowledge, our paper is one of the most comprehensive studies on reaction-diffusion equation-based GNNs. In our experiments with 9 datasets and 28 baselines, our method, called GREAD, outperforms them in a majority of cases. Further synthetic data experiments show that it mitigates the oversmoothing problem and works well for various homophily rates.

> Recently, numerous efforts have continued to push up performance boundaries of document-level relation extraction (DocRE) and have claimed significant progress in DocRE. In this paper, we do not aim at proposing a novel model for DocRE. Instead, we take a closer look at the field to see if these performance gains are actually true. By taking a comprehensive literature review and a thorough examination of popular DocRE datasets, we find that these performance gains are achieved upon a strong or even untenable assumption in common: all named entities are perfectly localized, normalized, and typed in advance. Next, we construct four types of entity mention attacks to examine the robustness of typical DocRE models by behavioral probing. We also have a close check on model usability in a more realistic setting. Our findings reveal that most of current DocRE models are vulnerable to entity mention attacks and difficult to be deployed in real-world end-user NLP applications. Our study calls more attentions for future research to stop simplifying problem setups, and to model DocRE in the wild rather than in an unrealistic Utopian world.

> The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) has recently emerged as a foundation model for addressing image segmentation. Owing to the intrinsic complexity of medical images and the high annotation cost, the medical image segmentation (MIS) community has been encouraged to investigate SAM's zero-shot capabilities to facilitate automatic annotation. Inspired by the extraordinary accomplishments of interactive medical image segmentation (IMIS) paradigm, this paper focuses on assessing the potential of SAM's zero-shot capabilities within the IMIS paradigm to amplify its benefits in the MIS domain. Regrettably, we observe that SAM's vulnerability to prompt forms (e.g., points, bounding boxes) becomes notably pronounced in IMIS. This leads us to develop a framework that adaptively offers suitable prompt forms for human experts. We refer to the framework above as temporally-extended prompts optimization (TEPO) and model it as a Markov decision process, solvable through reinforcement learning. Numerical experiments on the standardized benchmark BraTS2020 demonstrate that the learned TEPO agent can further enhance SAM's zero-shot capability in the MIS context.

We develop a novel combination of formal methods and machine learning tools that learns power system dynamics with the objective of generating unsafe yet stealthy false data based attack sequences. We enable the grid with anomaly detectors in a generalized manner so that it is difficult for an attacker to remain undetected. Our methodology, when applied on an IEEE 14 bus power grid model, uncovers stealthy attack vectors even in presence of such detectors.

> Due to the ever-increasing security breaches, practitioners are motivated to produce more secure software. In the United States, the White House Office released a memorandum on Executive Order (EO) 14028 that mandates organizations provide self-attestation of the use of secure software development practices. The OpenSSF Scorecard project allows practitioners to measure the use of software security practices automatically. However, little research has been done to determine whether the use of security practices improves package security, particularly which security practices have the biggest impact on security outcomes. The goal of this study is to assist practitioners and researchers making informed decisions on which security practices to adopt through the development of models between software security practice scores and security vulnerability counts.   To that end, we developed five supervised machine learning models for npm and PyPI packages using the OpenSSF Scorecared security practices scores and aggregate security scores as predictors and the number of externally-reported vulnerabilities as a target variable. Our models found four security practices (Maintained, Code Review, Branch Protection, and Security Policy) were the most important practices influencing vulnerability count. However, we had low R^2 (ranging from 9% to 12%) when we tested the models to predict vulnerability counts. Additionally, we observed that the number of reported vulnerabilities increased rather than reduced as the aggregate security score of the packages increased. Both findings indicate that additional factors may influence the package vulnerability count. We suggest that vulnerability count and security score data be refined such that these measures may be used to provide actionable guidance on security practices.

> Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have become popular in the literature since it allows heterogeneous agents to have their own reward functions as opposed to canonical multi-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP) settings which assume common reward functions over all agents. In this work, we follow the existing work on collaborative MARL where agents in a connected time varying network can exchange information among each other in order to reach a consensus. We introduce vulnerabilities in the consensus updates of existing MARL algorithms where agents can deviate from their usual consensus update, who we term as adversarial agents. We then proceed to provide an algorithm that allows non-adversarial agents to reach a consensus in the presence of adversaries under a constrained setting.

> The number of disclosed vulnerabilities has been steadily increasing over the years. At the same time, organizations face significant challenges patching their systems, leading to a need to prioritize vulnerability remediation in order to reduce the risk of attacks. Unfortunately, existing vulnerability scoring systems are either vendor-specific, proprietary, or are only commercially available. Moreover, these and other prioritization strategies based on vulnerability severity are poor predictors of actual vulnerability exploitation because they do not incorporate new information that might impact the likelihood of exploitation. In this paper we present the efforts behind building a Special Interest Group (SIG) that seeks to develop a completely data-driven exploit scoring system that produces scores for all known vulnerabilities, that is freely available, and which adapts to new information. The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) SIG consists of more than 170 experts from around the world and across all industries, providing crowd-sourced expertise and feedback. Based on these collective insights, we describe the design decisions and trade-offs that lead to the development of the next version of EPSS. This new machine learning model provides an 82\% performance improvement over past models in distinguishing vulnerabilities that are exploited in the wild and thus may be prioritized for remediation.

> Most software that runs on computers undergoes processing by compilers. Since compilers constitute the fundamental infrastructure of software development, their correctness is paramount. Over the years, researchers have invested in analyzing, understanding, and characterizing the bug features over mainstream compilers. These studies have demonstrated that compilers correctness requires greater research attention, and they also pave the way for compiler fuzzing. To improve compilers correctness, researchers have proposed numerous compiler fuzzing techniques. These techniques were initially developed for testing traditional compilers such as GCC/LLVM and have since been generalized to test various newly developed, domain-specific compilers, such as graphics shader compilers and deep learning (DL) compilers. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of the research efforts for understanding and addressing compilers defects. Specifically, this survey mainly covers two aspects. First, it covers researchers investigation and expertise on compilers bugs, such as their symptoms and root causes. The compiler bug studies cover GCC/LLVM, JVM compilers, and DL compilers. In addition, it covers researchers efforts in designing fuzzing techniques, including constructing test programs and designing test oracles. Besides discussing the existing work, this survey outlines several open challenges and highlights research opportunities.

> Relation extraction (RE) aims to extract relations from sentences and documents. Existing relation extraction models typically rely on supervised machine learning. However, recent studies showed that many RE datasets are incompletely annotated. This is known as the false negative problem in which valid relations are falsely annotated as 'no_relation'. Models trained with such data inevitably make similar mistakes during the inference stage. Self-training has been proven effective in alleviating the false negative problem. However, traditional self-training is vulnerable to confirmation bias and exhibits poor performance in minority classes. To overcome this limitation, we proposed a novel class-adaptive re-sampling self-training framework. Specifically, we re-sampled the pseudo-labels for each class by precision and recall scores. Our re-sampling strategy favored the pseudo-labels of classes with high precision and low recall, which improved the overall recall without significantly compromising precision. We conducted experiments on document-level and biomedical relation extraction datasets, and the results showed that our proposed self-training framework consistently outperforms existing competitive methods on the Re-DocRED and ChemDisgene datasets when the training data are incompletely annotated. Our code is released at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/CAST.

> In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of deep-learning-based password guessing models for targeted attacks on human-chosen passwords. In recent years, service providers have increased the level of security of users'passwords. This is done by requiring more complex password generation patterns and by using computationally expensive hash functions. For the attackers this means a reduced number of available guessing attempts, which introduces the necessity to target their guess by exploiting a victim's publicly available information. In this work, we introduce a context-aware password guessing model that better capture attackers'behavior. We demonstrate that knowing a victim's email address is already critical in compromising the associated password and provide an in-depth analysis of the relationship between them. We also show the potential of such models to identify clusters of users based on their password generation behaviour, which can spot fake profiles and populations more vulnerable to context-aware guesses.

> Deep Neural Networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial images. Conventional attacks strive for indistinguishable adversarial images with strictly restricted perturbations. Recently, researchers have moved to explore distinguishable yet non-suspicious adversarial images and demonstrated that color transformation attacks are effective. In this work, we propose Adversarial Color Filter (AdvCF), a novel color transformation attack that is optimized with gradient information in the parameter space of a simple color filter. In particular, our color filter space is explicitly specified so that we are able to provide a systematic analysis of model robustness against adversarial color transformations, from both the attack and defense perspectives. In contrast, existing color transformation attacks do not offer the opportunity for systematic analysis due to the lack of such an explicit space. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our AdvCF in fooling image classifiers and also compare it with other color transformation attacks regarding their robustness to defenses and image acceptability through an extensive user study. We also highlight the human-interpretability of AdvCF and show its superiority over the state-of-the-art human-interpretable color transformation attack on both image acceptability and efficiency. Additional results provide interesting new insights into model robustness against AdvCF in another three visual tasks.

> In federated learning, each participant trains its local model with its own data and a global model is formed at a trusted server by aggregating model updates coming from these participants. Since the server has no effect and visibility on the training procedure of the participants to ensure privacy, the global model becomes vulnerable to attacks such as data poisoning and model poisoning. Although many defense algorithms have recently been proposed to address these attacks, they often make strong assumptions that do not agree with the nature of federated learning, such as assuming Non-IID datasets. Moreover, they mostly lack comprehensive experimental analyses. In this work, we propose a defense algorithm called ARFED that does not make any assumptions about data distribution, update similarity of participants, or the ratio of the malicious participants. ARFED mainly considers the outlier status of participant updates for each layer of the model architecture based on the distance to the global model. Hence, the participants that do not have any outlier layer are involved in model aggregation. We have performed extensive experiments on diverse scenarios and shown that the proposed approach provides a robust defense against different attacks. To test the defense capability of the ARFED in different conditions, we considered label flipping, Byzantine, and partial knowledge attacks for both IID and Non-IID settings in our experimental evaluations. Moreover, we proposed a new attack, called organized partial knowledge attack, where malicious participants use their training statistics collaboratively to define a common poisoned model. We have shown that organized partial knowledge attacks are more effective than independent attacks.

> Mis- and disinformation are a substantial global threat to our security and safety. To cope with the scale of online misinformation, researchers have been working on automating fact-checking by retrieving and verifying against relevant evidence. However, despite many advances, a comprehensive evaluation of the possible attack vectors against such systems is still lacking. Particularly, the automated fact-verification process might be vulnerable to the exact disinformation campaigns it is trying to combat. In this work, we assume an adversary that automatically tampers with the online evidence in order to disrupt the fact-checking model via camouflaging the relevant evidence or planting a misleading one. We first propose an exploratory taxonomy that spans these two targets and the different threat model dimensions. Guided by this, we design and propose several potential attack methods. We show that it is possible to subtly modify claim-salient snippets in the evidence and generate diverse and claim-aligned evidence. Thus, we highly degrade the fact-checking performance under many different permutations of the taxonomy's dimensions. The attacks are also robust against post-hoc modifications of the claim. Our analysis further hints at potential limitations in models' inference when faced with contradicting evidence. We emphasize that these attacks can have harmful implications on the inspectable and human-in-the-loop usage scenarios of such models, and we conclude by discussing challenges and directions for future defenses.

> Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to small perturbations of their inputs, known as adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to adversarial attacks and propose a new attack algorithm called TransFool. To fool NMT models, TransFool builds on a multi-term optimization problem and a gradient projection step. By integrating the embedding representation of a language model, we generate fluent adversarial examples in the source language that maintain a high level of semantic similarity with the clean samples. Experimental results demonstrate that, for different translation tasks and NMT architectures, our white-box attack can severely degrade the translation quality while the semantic similarity between the original and the adversarial sentences stays high. Moreover, we show that TransFool is transferable to unknown target models. Finally, based on automatic and human evaluations, TransFool leads to improvement in terms of success rate, semantic similarity, and fluency compared to the existing attacks both in white-box and black-box settings. Thus, TransFool permits us to better characterize the vulnerability of NMT models and outlines the necessity to design strong defense mechanisms and more robust NMT systems for real-life applications.

> Traffic accident prediction in driving videos aims to provide an early warning of the accident occurrence, and supports the decision making of safe driving systems. Previous works usually concentrate on the spatial-temporal correlation of object-level context, while they do not fit the inherent long-tailed data distribution well and are vulnerable to severe environmental change. In this work, we propose a Cognitive Accident Prediction (CAP) method that explicitly leverages human-inspired cognition of text description on the visual observation and the driver attention to facilitate model training. In particular, the text description provides a dense semantic description guidance for the primary context of the traffic scene, while the driver attention provides a traction to focus on the critical region closely correlating with safe driving. CAP is formulated by an attentive text-to-vision shift fusion module, an attentive scene context transfer module, and the driver attention guided accident prediction module. We leverage the attention mechanism in these modules to explore the core semantic cues for accident prediction. In order to train CAP, we extend an existing self-collected DADA-2000 dataset (with annotated driver attention for each frame) with further factual text descriptions for the visual observations before the accidents. Besides, we construct a new large-scale benchmark consisting of 11,727 in-the-wild accident videos with over 2.19 million frames (named as CAP-DATA) together with labeled fact-effect-reason-introspection description and temporal accident frame label. Based on extensive experiments, the superiority of CAP is validated compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The code, CAP-DATA, and all results will be released in \url{https://github.com/JWFanggit/LOTVS-CAP}.

> Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks (AA). For an image recognition task, this means that a small perturbation of the original can result in the image being misclassified. Design of such attacks as well as methods of adversarial training against them are subject of intense research. We re-cast the problem using techniques of Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and obtain novel contributions leveraging recent insights from DRO sensitivity analysis. We consider a set of distributional threat models. Unlike the traditional pointwise attacks, which assume a uniform bound on perturbation of each input data point, distributional threat models allow attackers to perturb inputs in a non-uniform way. We link these more general attacks with questions of out-of-sample performance and Knightian uncertainty. To evaluate the distributional robustness of neural networks, we propose a first-order AA algorithm and its multi-step version. Our attack algorithms include Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) as special cases. Furthermore, we provide a new asymptotic estimate of the adversarial accuracy against distributional threat models. The bound is fast to compute and first-order accurate, offering new insights even for the pointwise AA. It also naturally yields out-of-sample performance guarantees. We conduct numerical experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset using DNNs on RobustBench to illustrate our theoretical results. Our code is available at https://github.com/JanObloj/W-DRO-Adversarial-Methods.

> When using adversarial training, it is common practice to train against the most egregious failures. However, this might imply using examples with sensitive information (such as leaked passwords or security vulnerabilities) as training data. One might assume that language models trained with gradient descent never generate text snippets which were only present in examples associated with the lowest possible reward. In this paper, we show that this assumption is wrong: in some situations, large language models do learn from such negatively-reinforced examples. We present a specific training setup that enables Pythia-160M to guess passwords 13% more often than it would by guessing randomly, despite only showing it these passwords on examples where the model is incentivized to not output these passwords.

> The superior performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to their application in various aspects of human life. Safety-critical applications are no exception and impose rigorous reliability requirements on DNNs. Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged to tackle the complexity of DNN accelerators, however, they are more prone to reliability issues.   In this paper, a recent analytical resilience assessment method is adapted for QNNs to identify critical neurons based on a Neuron Vulnerability Factor (NVF). Thereafter, a novel method for splitting the critical neurons is proposed that enables the design of a Lightweight Correction Unit (LCU) in the accelerator without redesigning its computational part.   The method is validated by experiments on different QNNs and datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method for correcting the faults has a twice smaller overhead than a selective Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) while achieving a similar level of fault resiliency.

> Android fragmentation refers to the overwhelming diversity of Android devices and OS versions. These lead to the impossibility of testing an app on every supported device, leaving a number of compatibility bugs scattered in the community and thereby resulting in poor user experiences. To mitigate this, our fellow researchers have designed various works to automatically detect such compatibility issues. However, the current state-of-the-art tools can only be used to detect specific kinds of compatibility issues (i.e., compatibility issues caused by API signature evolution), i.e., many other essential types of compatibility issues are still unrevealed. For example, customized OS versions on real devices and semantic changes of OS could lead to serious compatibility issues, which are non-trivial to be detected statically. To this end, we propose a novel, lightweight, crowdsourced testing approach, LAZYCOW, to fill this research gap and enable the possibility of taming Android fragmentation through crowdsourced efforts. Specifically, crowdsourced testing is an emerging alternative to conventional mobile testing mechanisms that allow developers to test their products on real devices to pinpoint platform-specific issues. Experimental results on thousands of test cases on real-world Android devices show that LAZYCOW is effective in automatically identifying and verifying API-induced compatibility issues. Also, after investigating the user experience through qualitative metrics, users' satisfaction provides strong evidence that LAZYCOW is useful and welcome in practice.

> Federated Graph Neural Network (FedGNN) has recently emerged as a rapidly growing research topic, as it integrates the strengths of graph neural networks and federated learning to enable advanced machine learning applications without direct access to sensitive data. Despite its advantages, the distributed nature of FedGNN introduces additional vulnerabilities, particularly backdoor attacks stemming from malicious participants. Although graph backdoor attacks have been explored, the compounded complexity introduced by the combination of GNNs and federated learning has hindered a comprehensive understanding of these attacks, as existing research lacks extensive benchmark coverage and in-depth analysis of critical factors. To address these limitations, we propose Bkd-FedGNN, a benchmark for backdoor attacks on FedGNN. Specifically, Bkd-FedGNN decomposes the graph backdoor attack into trigger generation and injection steps, and extending the attack to the node-level federated setting, resulting in a unified framework that covers both node-level and graph-level classification tasks. Moreover, we thoroughly investigate the impact of multiple critical factors in backdoor attacks on FedGNN. These factors are categorized into global-level and local-level factors, including data distribution, the number of malicious attackers, attack time, overlapping rate, trigger size, trigger type, trigger position, and poisoning rate. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on 13 benchmark datasets and 13 critical factors, comprising 1,725 experimental configurations for node-level and graph-level tasks from six domains. These experiments encompass over 8,000 individual tests, allowing us to provide a thorough evaluation and insightful observations that advance our understanding of backdoor attacks on FedGNN.The Bkd-FedGNN benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/BkdFedGCN.

> Cyber attacks deceive machines into believing something that does not exist in the first place. However, there are some to which even humans fall prey. One such famous attack that attackers have used over the years to exploit the vulnerability of vision is known to be a Homoglyph attack. It employs a primary yet effective mechanism to create illegitimate domains that are hard to differentiate from legit ones. Moreover, as the difference is pretty indistinguishable for a user to notice, they cannot stop themselves from clicking on these homoglyph domain names. In many cases, that results in either information theft or malware attack on their systems. Existing approaches use simple, string-based comparison techniques applied in primary language-based tasks. Although they are impactful to some extent, they usually fail because they are not robust to different types of homoglyphs and are computationally not feasible because of their time requirement proportional to the string length. Similarly, neural network-based approaches are employed to determine real domain strings from fake ones. Nevertheless, the problem with both methods is that they require paired sequences of real and fake domain strings to work with, which is often not the case in the real world, as the attacker only sends the illegitimate or homoglyph domain to the vulnerable user. Therefore, existing approaches are not suitable for practical scenarios in the real world. In our work, we created GlyphNet, an image dataset that contains 4M domains, both real and homoglyphs. Additionally, we introduce a baseline method for a homoglyph attack detection system using an attention-based convolutional Neural Network. We show that our model can reach state-of-the-art accuracy in detecting homoglyph attacks with a 0.93 AUC on our dataset.

> Although existing techniques have proposed automated approaches to alleviate the path explosion problem of symbolic execution, users still need to optimize symbolic execution by applying various searching strategies carefully. As existing approaches mainly support only coarse-grained global searching strategies, they cannot efficiently traverse through complex code structures. In this paper, we propose Eunomia, a symbolic execution technique that allows users to specify local domain knowledge to enable fine-grained search. In Eunomia, we design an expressive DSL, Aes, that lets users precisely pinpoint local searching strategies to different parts of the target program. To further optimize local searching strategies, we design an interval-based algorithm that automatically isolates the context of variables for different local searching strategies, avoiding conflicts between local searching strategies for the same variable. We implement Eunomia as a symbolic execution platform targeting WebAssembly, which enables us to analyze applications written in various languages (like C and Go) but can be compiled into WebAssembly. To the best of our knowledge, Eunomia is the first symbolic execution engine that supports the full features of the WebAssembly runtime. We evaluate Eunomia with a dedicated microbenchmark suite for symbolic execution and six real-world applications. Our evaluation shows that Eunomia accelerates bug detection in real-world applications by up to three orders of magnitude. According to the results of a comprehensive user study, users can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of symbolic execution by writing a simple and intuitive Aes script. Besides verifying six known real-world bugs, Eunomia also detected two new zero-day bugs in a popular open-source project, Collections-C.

> Spatial-temporal graph learning has emerged as a promising solution for modeling structured spatial-temporal data and learning region representations for various urban sensing tasks such as crime forecasting and traffic flow prediction. However, most existing models are vulnerable to the quality of the generated region graph due to the inaccurate graph-structured information aggregation schema. The ubiquitous spatial-temporal data noise and incompleteness in real-life scenarios pose challenges in generating high-quality region representations. To address this challenge, we propose a new spatial-temporal graph learning model (GraphST) for enabling effective self-supervised learning. Our proposed model is an adversarial contrastive learning paradigm that automates the distillation of crucial multi-view self-supervised information for robust spatial-temporal graph augmentation. We empower GraphST to adaptively identify hard samples for better self-supervision, enhancing the representation discrimination ability and robustness. In addition, we introduce a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm to model the inter-dependencies across view-specific region representations and preserve underlying relation heterogeneity. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GraphST method in various spatial-temporal prediction tasks on real-life datasets. We release our model implementation via the link: \url{https://github.com/HKUDS/GraphST}.

> Combining Federated Learning (FL) with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a promising approach for realizing privacy-preserving FL, which has garnered significant academic attention in recent years. Implementing the TEE on the server side enables each round of FL to proceed without exposing the client's gradient information to untrusted servers. This addresses usability gaps in existing secure aggregation schemes as well as utility gaps in differentially private FL. However, to address the issue using a TEE, the vulnerabilities of server-side TEEs need to be considered -- this has not been sufficiently investigated in the context of FL. The main technical contribution of this study is the analysis of the vulnerabilities of TEE in FL and the defense. First, we theoretically analyze the leakage of memory access patterns, revealing the risk of sparsified gradients, which are commonly used in FL to enhance communication efficiency and model accuracy. Second, we devise an inference attack to link memory access patterns to sensitive information in the training dataset. Finally, we propose an oblivious yet efficient aggregation algorithm to prevent memory access pattern leakage. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method functions efficiently in practical scales.

> In this paper, we reveal the existence of a new class of prefetcher, the XPT prefetcher, in the modern Intel processors which has never been officially documented. It speculatively issues a load, bypassing last-level cache (LLC) lookups, when it predicts that a load request will result in an LLC miss. We demonstrate that XPT prefetcher is shared among different cores, which enables an attacker to build cross-core side-channel and covert-channel attacks. We propose PrefetchX, a cross-core attack mechanism, to leak users' sensitive data and activities.   We empirically demonstrate that PrefetchX can be used to extract private keys of real-world RSA applications. Furthermore, we show that PrefetchX can enable side-channel attacks that can monitor keystrokes and network traffic patterns of users. Our two cross-core covert-channel attacks also see a low error rate and a 1.7MB/s maximum channel capacity. Due to the cache-independent feature of PrefetchX, current cache-based mitigations are not effective against our attacks. Overall, our work uncovers a significant vulnerability in the XPT prefetcher, which can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information in both crypto and non-crypto-related applications among processor cores.

> Nowadays, IoT devices integrate a wealth of third-party components (TPCs) in firmware to shorten the development cycle. TPCs usually have strict usage specifications, e.g., checking the return value of the function. Violating the usage specifications of TPCs can cause serious consequences, e.g., NULL pointer dereference. Therefore, this massive amount of TPC integrations, if not properly implemented, will lead to pervasive vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Detecting vulnerabilities automatically in TPC integration is challenging from several perspectives: (1) There is a gap between the high-level specifications from TPC documents, and the low-level implementations in the IoT firmware. (2) IoT firmware is mostly the closed-source binary, which loses a lot of information when compiling from the source code and has diverse architectures.   To address these challenges, we design and implement UVScan, an automated and scalable system to detect TPC usage violations in IoT firmware. In UVScan, we first propose a novel natural language processing (NLP)-based rule extraction framework, which extracts API specifications from inconsistently formatted TPC documents. We then design a rule-driven NLP-guided binary analysis engine, which maps the logical information from the high-level TPC document to the low-level binary, and detects TPC usage violations in IoT firmware across different architectures. We evaluate UVScan from four perspectives on four popular TPCs and six ground-truth datasets. The results show that UVScan achieves more than 70% precision and recall, and has a significant performance improvement compared with even the source-level API misuse detectors.

> New speculation-based attacks that affect large numbers of modern systems are disclosed regularly. Currently, CPU vendors regularly fall back to heavy-handed mitigations like using barriers or enforcing strict programming guidelines resulting in significant performance overhead. What is missing is a solution that allows for efficient mitigation and is flexible enough to address both current and future speculation vulnerabilities, without additional hardware changes.   In this work, we present SpecControl, a novel hardware/software co-design, that enables new levels of security while reducing the performance overhead that has been demonstrated by state-of-the-art methodologies. SpecControl introduces a communication interface that allows compilers and application developers to inform the hardware about true branch dependencies, confidential control-flow instructions, and fine-grained instruction constraints in order to apply restrictions only when necessary. We evaluate SpecControl against known speculative execution attacks and in addition, present a new speculative fetch attack variant on the Pattern History Table (PHT) in branch predictors that shows how similar previously reported vulnerabilities are more dangerous by enabling unprivileged attacks, especially with the state-of-the-art branch predictors. SpecControl provides stronger security guarantees compared to the existing defenses while reducing the performance overhead of two state-of-the-art defenses from 51% and 43% to just 23%.

> With the explosion of graph-structured data, link prediction has emerged as an increasingly important task. Embedding methods for link prediction utilize neural networks to generate node embeddings, which are subsequently employed to predict links between nodes. However, the existing embedding methods typically take a holistic strategy to learn node embeddings and ignore the entanglement of latent factors. As a result, entangled embeddings fail to effectively capture the underlying information and are vulnerable to irrelevant information, leading to unconvincing and uninterpretable link prediction results. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework with two variants, the disentangled graph auto-encoder (DGAE) and the variational disentangled graph auto-encoder (VDGAE). Our work provides a pioneering effort to apply the disentanglement strategy to link prediction. The proposed framework infers the latent factors that cause edges in the graph and disentangles the representation into multiple channels corresponding to unique latent factors, which contributes to improving the performance of link prediction. To further encourage the embeddings to capture mutually exclusive latent factors, we introduce mutual information regularization to enhance the independence among different channels. Extensive experiments on various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results compared to a variety of strong baselines on link prediction tasks. Qualitative analysis on the synthetic dataset also illustrates that the proposed methods can capture distinct latent factors that cause links, providing empirical evidence that our models are able to explain the results of link prediction to some extent. All code will be made publicly available upon publication of the paper.

> Speckle noise has long been an extensively studied problem in medical imaging. In recent years, there have been significant advances in leveraging deep learning methods for noise reduction. Nevertheless, adaptation of supervised learning models to unseen domains remains a challenging problem. Specifically, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained for computational imaging tasks are vulnerable to changes in the acquisition system's physical parameters, such as: sampling space, resolution, and contrast. Even within the same acquisition system, performance degrades across datasets of different biological tissues. In this work, we propose a few-shot supervised learning framework for optical coherence tomography (OCT) noise reduction, that offers a dramatic increase in training speed and requires only a single image, or part of an image, and a corresponding speckle suppressed ground truth, for training. Furthermore, we formulate the domain shift problem for OCT diverse imaging systems, and prove that the output resolution of a despeckling trained model is determined by the source domain resolution. We also provide possible remedies. We propose different practical implementations of our approach, verify and compare their applicability, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate significant potential for generally improving sample complexity, generalization, and time efficiency, for coherent and non-coherent noise reduction via supervised learning models, that can also be leveraged for other real-time computer vision applications.

- *Thomas Hickling, Nabil Aouf, Phillippa Spencer*

- `2206.02670v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02670v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02670v4)

> The dangers of adversarial attacks on Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agents operating in public are increasing. Adopting AI-based techniques and, more specifically, Deep Learning (DL) approaches to control and guide these UAVs can be beneficial in terms of performance but can add concerns regarding the safety of those techniques and their vulnerability against adversarial attacks. Confusion in the agent's decision-making process caused by these attacks can seriously affect the safety of the UAV. This paper proposes an innovative approach based on the explainability of DL methods to build an efficient detector that will protect these DL schemes and the UAVs adopting them from attacks. The agent adopts a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheme for guidance and planning. The agent is trained with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) DRL scheme that utilises Artificial Potential Field (APF) to improve training times and obstacle avoidance performance. A simulated environment for UAV explainable DRL-based planning and guidance, including obstacles and adversarial attacks, is built. The adversarial attacks are generated by the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) algorithm and reduced obstacle course completion rates from 97\% to 35\%. Two adversarial attack detectors are proposed to counter this reduction. The first one is a Convolutional Neural Network Adversarial Detector (CNN-AD), which achieves accuracy in the detection of 80\%. The second detector utilises a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. It achieves an accuracy of 91\% with faster computing times compared to the CNN-AD, allowing for real-time adversarial detection.

> Software vulnerability detection is critical in software security because it identifies potential bugs in software systems, enabling immediate remediation and mitigation measures to be implemented before they may be exploited. Automatic vulnerability identification is important because it can evaluate large codebases more efficiently than manual code auditing. Many Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based models for detecting vulnerabilities in source code have been presented in recent years. However, a survey that summarises, classifies, and analyses the application of ML/DL models for vulnerability detection is missing. It may be difficult to discover gaps in existing research and potential for future improvement without a comprehensive survey. This could result in essential areas of research being overlooked or under-represented, leading to a skewed understanding of the state of the art in vulnerability detection. This work address that gap by presenting a systematic survey to characterize various features of ML/DL-based source code level software vulnerability detection approaches via five primary research questions (RQs). Specifically, our RQ1 examines the trend of publications that leverage ML/DL for vulnerability detection, including the evolution of research and the distribution of publication venues. RQ2 describes vulnerability datasets used by existing ML/DL-based models, including their sources, types, and representations, as well as analyses of the embedding techniques used by these approaches. RQ3 explores the model architectures and design assumptions of ML/DL-based vulnerability detection approaches. RQ4 summarises the type and frequency of vulnerabilities that are covered by existing studies. Lastly, RQ5 presents a list of current challenges to be researched and an outline of a potential research roadmap that highlights crucial opportunities for future work.

> Hardware intellectual property (IP) piracy is an emerging threat to the global supply chain. Correspondingly, various countermeasures aim to protect hardware IPs, such as logic locking, camouflaging, and split manufacturing. However, these countermeasures cannot always guarantee IP security. A malicious attacker can access the layout/netlist of the hardware IP protected by these countermeasures and further retrieve the design. To eliminate/bypass these vulnerabilities, a recent approach redacts the design's IP to an embedded field-programmable gate array (eFPGA), disabling the attacker's access to the layout/netlist. eFPGAs can be programmed with arbitrary functionality. Without the bitstream, the attacker cannot recover the functionality of the protected IP. Consequently, state-of-the-art attacks are inapplicable to pirate the redacted hardware IP. In this paper, we challenge the assumed security of eFPGA-based redaction. We present an attack to retrieve the hardware IP with only black-box access to a programmed eFPGA. We observe the effect of modern electronic design automation (EDA) tools on practical hardware circuits and leverage the observation to guide our attack. Thus, our proposed method FuncTeller selects minterms to query, recovering the circuit function within a reasonable time. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FuncTeller on multiple circuits, including academic benchmark circuits, Stanford MIPS processor, IBEX processor, Common Evaluation Platform GPS, and Cybersecurity Awareness Worldwide competition circuits. Our results show that FuncTeller achieves an average accuracy greater than 85% over these tested circuits retrieving the design's functionality.

> Emulation-based fuzzers enable testing binaries without source code, and facilitate testing embedded applications where automated execution on the target hardware architecture is difficult and slow. The instrumentation techniques added to extract feedback and guide input mutations towards generating effective test cases is at the core of modern fuzzers. But, modern emulation-based fuzzers have evolved by re-purposing general-purpose emulators; consequently, developing and integrating fuzzing techniques, such as instrumentation methods, are difficult and often added in an ad-hoc manner, specific to an instruction set architecture (ISA). This limits state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques to few ISAs such as x86/x86-64 or ARM/AArch64; a significant problem for firmware fuzzing of diverse ISAs.   This study presents our efforts to re-think emulation for fuzzing. We design and implement a fuzzing-specific, multi-architecture emulation framework -- Icicle. We demonstrate the capability to add instrumentation once, in an architecture agnostic manner, with low execution overhead. We employ Icicle as the emulator for a state-of-the-art ARM firmware fuzzer -- Fuzzware -- and replicate results. Significantly, we demonstrate the availability of new instrumentation in Icicle enabled the discovery of new bugs. We demonstrate the fidelity of Icicle and efficacy of architecture agnostic instrumentation by discovering LAVA-M benchmark bugs, requiring a known and specific operational capability of instrumentation techniques, across a diverse set of instruction set architectures (x86-64, ARM/AArch64, RISC-V, MIPS). Further, to demonstrate the effectiveness of Icicle to discover bugs in a currently unsupported architecture in emulation-based fuzzers, we perform a fuzzing campaign with real-world MSP430 firmware binaries and discovered 7 new bugs.

> Deep Learning (DL) compilers are widely adopted to optimize advanced DL models for efficient deployment on diverse hardware. Their quality has profound effect on the quality of compiled DL models. A recent bug study shows that the optimization of high-level intermediate representation (IR) is the most error-prone compilation stage. Bugs in this stage are accountable for 44.92% of the whole collected ones. However, existing testing techniques do not consider high-level optimization related features (e.g. high-level IR), and are therefore weak in exposing bugs at this stage. To bridge this gap, we propose HirGen, an automated testing technique that aims to effectively expose coding mistakes in the optimization of high-level IR. The design of HirGen includes 1) three coverage criteria to generate diverse and valid computational graphs; 2) full use of high-level IRs language features to generate diverse IRs; 3) three test oracles inspired from both differential testing and metamorphic testing. HirGen has successfully detected 21 bugs that occur at TVM, with 17 bugs confirmed and 12 fixed. Further, we construct four baselines using the state-of-the-art DL compiler fuzzers that can cover the high-level optimization stage. Our experiment results show that HirGen can detect 10 crashes and inconsistencies that cannot be detected by the baselines in 48 hours. We further validate the usefulness of our proposed coverage criteria and test oracles in evaluation.

> Adversarial attack research in natural language processing (NLP) has made significant progress in designing powerful attack methods and defence approaches. However, few efforts have sought to identify which source samples are the most attackable or robust, i.e. can we determine for an unseen target model, which samples are the most vulnerable to an adversarial attack. This work formally extends the definition of sample attackability/robustness for NLP attacks. Experiments on two popular NLP datasets, four state of the art models and four different NLP adversarial attack methods, demonstrate that sample uncertainty is insufficient for describing characteristics of attackable/robust samples and hence a deep learning based detector can perform much better at identifying the most attackable and robust samples for an unseen target model. Nevertheless, further analysis finds that there is little agreement in which samples are considered the most attackable/robust across different NLP attack methods, explaining a lack of portability of attackability detection methods across attack methods.

> Adversarial attacks on deep-learning models pose a serious threat to their reliability and security. Existing defense mechanisms are narrow addressing a specific type of attack or being vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. We propose a new defense mechanism that, while being focused on image-based classifiers, is general with respect to the cited category. It is rooted on hyperspace projection. In particular, our solution provides a pseudo-random projection of the original dataset into a new dataset. The proposed defense mechanism creates a set of diverse projected datasets, where each projected dataset is used to train a specific classifier, resulting in different trained classifiers with different decision boundaries. During testing, it randomly selects a classifier to test the input. Our approach does not sacrifice accuracy over legitimate input. Other than detailing and providing a thorough characterization of our defense mechanism, we also provide a proof of concept of using four optimization-based adversarial attacks (PGD, FGSM, IGSM, and C\&W) and a generative adversarial attack testing them on the MNIST dataset. Our experimental results show that our solution increases the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks and significantly reduces the attack success rate by at least 89% for optimization attacks and 78% for generative attacks. We also analyze the relationship between the number of used hyperspaces and the efficacy of the defense mechanism. As expected, the two are positively correlated, offering an easy-to-tune parameter to enforce the desired level of security. The generality and scalability of our solution and adaptability to different attack scenarios, combined with the excellent achieved results, other than providing a robust defense against adversarial attacks on deep learning networks, also lay the groundwork for future research in the field.

Designed for cybersecurity, ICAR is a category whose objects are cybersecurity knowledge (weakness, vulnerability, impacted product, attack technique, etc.) and whose morphisms are relations between this knowledge, that make sense for cybersecurity. Within this rigorous and unified framework, we obtain a knowledge graph capable of identifying the attack and weakness structures of an IS, at the interface between description logics, database theory and cybersecurity. We then define ten cybersecurity queries to help understand the risks incurred by IS and organise their defence.

> Quantum key agreement enables remote participants to fairly establish a secure shared key based on their private inputs. In the circular-type multiparty quantum key agreement mode, two or more malicious participants can collude together to steal private inputs of honest participants or to generate the final key alone. In this work, we focus on a powerful collusive attack strategy in which two or more malicious participants in particular positions, can learn sensitive information or generate the final key alone without revealing their malicious behaviour. Many of the current circular-type multiparty quantum key agreement protocols are not secure against this collusive attack strategy. As an example, we analyze the security of a recently proposed multiparty key agreement protocol to show the vulnerability of existing circular-type multiparty quantum key agreement protocols against this collusive attack. Moreover, we design a general secure multiparty key agreement model that would remove this vulnerability from such circular-type key agreement protocols and describe the necessary steps to implement this model. The proposed model is general and does not depend on the specific physical implementation of the quantum key agreement.

> Having become vital to satisfying basic human needs, water distribution systems (WDSs) are considered critical infrastructure. They are vulnerable to critical events such as extreme weather, natural and man-made disasters, armed conflicts etc. To account for critical events in the context of design and operation of WDSs, the concept of resilience is frequently mentioned. How resilience of WDSs can be assessed using resilience metrics has been the subject of research of many publications. The aim of this paper is to inspect the alignment between a general understanding of resilience in WDSs and the metrics used for resilience assessment. A novel framework for categorising resilience metrics for WDSs is presented. A literature review of resilience metrics for WDSs is performed and the results are analysed using the framework designed. The results show that resilience metrics do not really assess resilience of the systems, but rather only specific functions and properties of systems which can make them resilient.

> In real scenarios, state observations that an agent observes may contain measurement errors or adversarial noises, misleading the agent to take suboptimal actions or even collapse while training. In this paper, we study the training robustness of distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL), a class of state-of-the-art methods that estimate the whole distribution, as opposed to only the expectation, of the total return. Firstly, we validate the contraction of distributional Bellman operators in the State-Noisy Markov Decision Process (SN-MDP), a typical tabular case that incorporates both random and adversarial state observation noises. In the noisy setting with function approximation, we then analyze the vulnerability of least squared loss in expectation-based RL with either linear or nonlinear function approximation. By contrast, we theoretically characterize the bounded gradient norm of distributional RL loss based on the categorical parameterization equipped with the KL divergence. The resulting stable gradients while the optimization in distributional RL accounts for its better training robustness against state observation noises. Finally, extensive experiments on the suite of environments verified that distributional RL is less vulnerable against both random and adversarial noisy state observations compared with its expectation-based counterpart.

> The ubiquitous presence of printed circuit boards (PCBs) in modern electronic systems and embedded devices makes their integrity a top security concern. To take advantage of the economies of scale, today's PCB design and manufacturing are often performed by suppliers around the globe, exposing them to many security vulnerabilities along the segmented PCB supply chain. Moreover, the increasing complexity of the PCB designs also leaves ample room for numerous sneaky board-level attacks to be implemented throughout each stage of a PCB's lifetime, threatening many electronic devices. In this paper, we propose PDNPulse, a power delivery network (PDN) based PCB anomaly detection framework that can identify a wide spectrum of board-level malicious modifications. PDNPulse leverages the fact that the PDN's characteristics are inevitably affected by modifications to the PCB, no matter how minuscule. By detecting changes to the PDN impedance profile and using the Frechet distance-based anomaly detection algorithms, PDNPulse can robustly and successfully discern malicious modifications across the system. Using PDNPulse, we conduct extensive experiments on seven commercial-off-the-shelf PCBs, covering different design scales, different threat models, and seven different anomaly types. The results confirm that PDNPulse creates an effective security asymmetry between attack and defense.

> Code contains security and functional bugs. The process of identifying and localizing them is difficult and relies on human labor. In this work, we present a novel approach (FLAG) to assist human debuggers. FLAG is based on the lexical capabilities of generative AI, specifically, Large Language Models (LLMs). Here, we input a code file then extract and regenerate each line within that file for self-comparison. By comparing the original code with an LLM-generated alternative, we can flag notable differences as anomalies for further inspection, with features such as distance from comments and LLM confidence also aiding this classification. This reduces the inspection search space for the designer. Unlike other automated approaches in this area, FLAG is language-agnostic, can work on incomplete (and even non-compiling) code and requires no creation of security properties, functional tests or definition of rules. In this work, we explore the features that help LLMs in this classification and evaluate the performance of FLAG on known bugs. We use 121 benchmarks across C, Python and Verilog; with each benchmark containing a known security or functional weakness. We conduct the experiments using two state of the art LLMs in OpenAI's code-davinci-002 and gpt-3.5-turbo, but our approach may be used by other models. FLAG can identify 101 of the defects and helps reduce the search space to 12-17% of source code.

> Todays industrial control systems consist of tightly coupled components allowing adversaries to exploit security attack surfaces from the information technology side, and, thus, also get access to automation devices residing at the operational technology level to compromise their safety functions. To identify these concerns, we propose a model-based testing approach which we consider a promising way to analyze the safety and security behavior of a system under test providing means to protect its components and to increase the quality and efficiency of the overall system. The structure of the underlying framework is divided into four parts, according to the critical factors in testing of operational technology environments. As a first step, this paper describes the ingredients of the envisioned framework. A system model allows to overview possible attack surfaces, while the foundations of testing and the recommendation of mitigation strategies will be based on process-specific safety and security standard procedures with the combination of existing vulnerability databases.

> Machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for data driven tasks such as image classification and feature detection, however their vulnerability to adversarial examples - input samples manipulated to fool the algorithm - remains a serious challenge. The integration of machine learning with quantum computing has the potential to yield tools offering not only better accuracy and computational efficiency, but also superior robustness against adversarial attacks. Indeed, recent work has employed quantum mechanical phenomena to defend against adversarial attacks, spurring the rapid development of the field of quantum adversarial machine learning (QAML) and potentially yielding a new source of quantum advantage. Despite promising early results, there remain challenges towards building robust real-world QAML tools. In this review we discuss recent progress in QAML and identify key challenges. We also suggest future research directions which could determine the route to practicality for QAML approaches as quantum computing hardware scales up and noise levels are reduced.

> We investigate the feasibility of employing large language models (LLMs) for conducting the security audit of smart contracts, a traditionally time-consuming and costly process. Our research focuses on the optimization of prompt engineering for enhanced security analysis, and we evaluate the performance and accuracy of LLMs using a benchmark dataset comprising 52 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts that have previously been compromised.   Our findings reveal that, when applied to vulnerable contracts, both GPT-4 and Claude models correctly identify the vulnerability type in 40% of the cases. However, these models also demonstrate a high false positive rate, necessitating continued involvement from manual auditors. The LLMs tested outperform a random model by 20% in terms of F1-score.   To ensure the integrity of our study, we conduct mutation testing on five newly developed and ostensibly secure smart contracts, into which we manually insert two and 15 vulnerabilities each. This testing yielded a remarkable best-case 78.7% true positive rate for the GPT-4-32k model. We tested both, asking the models to perform a binary classification on whether a contract is vulnerable, and a non-binary prompt. We also examined the influence of model temperature variations and context length on the LLM's performance.   Despite the potential for many further enhancements, this work lays the groundwork for a more efficient and economical approach to smart contract security audits.

> Network operators and system administrators are increasingly overwhelmed with incessant cyber-security threats ranging from malicious network reconnaissance to attacks such as distributed denial of service and data breaches. A large number of these attacks could be prevented if the network operators were better equipped with threat intelligence information that would allow them to block or throttle nefarious scanning activities. Network telescopes or "darknets" offer a unique window into observing Internet-wide scanners and other malicious entities, and they could offer early warning signals to operators that would be critical for infrastructure protection and/or attack mitigation. A network telescope consists of unused or "dark" IP spaces that serve no users, and solely passively observes any Internet traffic destined to the "telescope sensor" in an attempt to record ubiquitous network scanners, malware that forage for vulnerable devices, and other dubious activities. Hence, monitoring network telescopes for timely detection of coordinated and heavy scanning activities is an important, albeit challenging, task. The challenges mainly arise due to the non-stationarity and the dynamic nature of Internet traffic and, more importantly, the fact that one needs to monitor high-dimensional signals (e.g., all TCP/UDP ports) to search for "sparse" anomalies. We propose statistical methods to address both challenges in an efficient and "online" manner; our work is validated both with synthetic data as well as real-world data from a large network telescope.

> Quantum computing has emerged as a promising domain for the machine learning (ML) area, offering significant computational advantages over classical counterparts. With the growing interest in quantum machine learning (QML), ensuring the correctness and robustness of software platforms to develop such QML programs is critical. A necessary step for ensuring the reliability of such platforms is to understand the bugs they typically suffer from. To address this need, this paper presents the first comprehensive study of bugs in QML frameworks. We inspect 391 real-world bugs collected from 22 open-source repositories of nine popular QML frameworks. We find that 1) 28% of the bugs are quantum-specific, such as erroneous unitary matrix implementation, calling for dedicated approaches to find and prevent them; 2) We manually distilled a taxonomy of five symptoms and nine root cause of bugs in QML platforms; 3) We summarized four critical challenges for QML framework developers. The study results provide researchers with insights into how to ensure QML framework quality and present several actionable suggestions for QML framework developers to improve their code quality.

As a first line of defense against such fake faces, deep learning based forensic classifiers have been developed. While these forensic models can detect whether a face image is synthetic or real with high accuracy, they are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although such attacks can be highly successful in evading detection by forensic classifiers, they introduce visible noise patterns that are detectable through careful human scrutiny. Additionally, these attacks assume access to the target model(s) which may not always be true. Attempts have been made to directly perturb the latent space of GANs to produce adversarial fake faces that can circumvent forensic classifiers. In this work, we go one step further and show that it is possible to successfully generate adversarial fake faces with a specified set of attributes (e.g., hair color, eye size, race, gender, etc.). To achieve this goal, we leverage the state-of-the-art generative model StyleGAN with disentangled representations, which enables a range of modifications without leaving the manifold of natural images. We propose a framework to search for adversarial latent codes within the feature space of StyleGAN, where the search can be guided either by a text prompt or a reference image. We also propose a meta-learning based optimization strategy to achieve transferable performance on unknown target models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can produce semantically manipulated adversarial fake faces, which are true to the specified attribute set and can successfully fool forensic face classifiers, while remaining undetectable by humans.

> Perturbative availability poisons (PAPs) add small changes to images to prevent their use for model training. Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.

> Traditional email encryption schemes are vulnerable to EFail attacks, which exploit the lack of message authentication by manipulating ciphertexts and exfiltrating plaintext via HTML backchannels. Swiss Post's IncaMail, a secure email service for transmitting legally binding, encrypted, and verifiable emails, counters EFail attacks using an authenticated-encryption with associated data (AEAD) encryption scheme to ensure message privacy and authentication between servers. IncaMail relies on a trusted infrastructure backend and encrypts messages per user policy. This paper presents a revised IncaMail architecture that offloads the majority of cryptographic operations to clients, offering benefits such as reduced computational load and energy footprint, relaxed trust assumptions, and per-message encryption key policies. Our proof-of-concept prototype and benchmarks demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme, with client-side WebAssembly-based cryptographic operations yielding significant performance improvements (up to ~14x) over conventional JavaScript implementations.

> Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular as a go-to approach for many tasks due to its world-class results. As a result, antivirus developers are incorporating machine learning models into their products. While these models improve malware detection capabilities, they also carry the disadvantage of being susceptible to adversarial attacks. Although this vulnerability has been demonstrated for many models in white-box settings, a black-box attack is more applicable in practice for the domain of malware detection. We present a generator of adversarial malware examples using reinforcement learning algorithms. The reinforcement learning agents utilize a set of functionality-preserving modifications, thus creating valid adversarial examples. Using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, we achieved an evasion rate of 53.84% against the gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model. The PPO agent previously trained against the GBDT classifier scored an evasion rate of 11.41% against the neural network-based classifier MalConv and an average evasion rate of 2.31% against top antivirus programs. Furthermore, we discovered that random application of our functionality-preserving portable executable modifications successfully evades leading antivirus engines, with an average evasion rate of 11.65%. These findings indicate that machine learning-based models used in malware detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that better safeguards need to be taken to protect these systems.

> Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where a fraction of the training data is manipulated to deliberately degrade the algorithms' performance. Optimal attacks can be formulated as bilevel optimization problems and help to assess their robustness in worst-case scenarios. We show that current approaches, which typically assume that hyperparameters remain constant, lead to an overly pessimistic view of the algorithms' robustness and of the impact of regularization. We propose a novel optimal attack formulation that considers the effect of the attack on the hyperparameters and models the attack as a multiobjective bilevel optimization problem. This allows to formulate optimal attacks, learn hyperparameters and evaluate robustness under worst-case conditions. We apply this attack formulation to several ML classifiers using $L_2$ and $L_1$ regularization. Our evaluation on multiple datasets confirms the limitations of previous strategies and evidences the benefits of using $L_2$ and $L_1$ regularization to dampen the effect of poisoning attacks.

> Natural language processing (NLP) models have become increasingly popular in real-world applications, such as text classification. However, they are vulnerable to privacy attacks, including data reconstruction attacks that aim to extract the data used to train the model. Most previous studies on data reconstruction attacks have focused on LLM, while classification models were assumed to be more secure. In this work, we propose a new targeted data reconstruction attack called the Mix And Match attack, which takes advantage of the fact that most classification models are based on LLM. The Mix And Match attack uses the base model of the target model to generate candidate tokens and then prunes them using the classification head. We extensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack using both random and organic canaries. This work highlights the importance of considering the privacy risks associated with data reconstruction attacks in classification models and offers insights into possible leakages.

> Recent works demonstrate that GNN models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which refer to imperceptible perturbation on the graph structure and node features. Among various GNN models, graph contrastive learning (GCL) based methods specifically suffer from adversarial attacks due to their inherent design that highly depends on the self-supervision signals derived from the original graph, which however already contains noise when the graph is attacked. To achieve adversarial robustness against such attacks, existing methods adopt adversarial training (AT) to the GCL framework, which considers the attacked graph as an augmentation under the GCL framework. However, we find that existing adversarially trained GCL methods achieve robustness at the expense of not being able to preserve the node feature similarity. In this paper, we propose a similarity-preserving adversarial graph contrastive learning (SP-AGCL) framework that contrasts the clean graph with two auxiliary views of different properties (i.e., the node similarity-preserving view and the adversarial view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-AGCL achieves a competitive performance on several downstream tasks, and shows its effectiveness in various scenarios, e.g., a network with adversarial attacks, noisy labels, and heterophilous neighbors. Our code is available at https://github.com/yeonjun-in/torch-SP-AGCL.

> Introducing computational thinking in primary school curricula implies that teachers have to prepare appropriate lesson material. Typically this includes creating programming tasks, which may overwhelm primary school teachers with lacking programming subject knowledge. Inadequate resulting example code may negatively affect learning, and students might adopt bad programming habits or misconceptions. To avoid this problem, automated program analysis tools have the potential to help scaffolding task creation processes. For example, static program analysis tools can automatically detect both good and bad code patterns, and provide hints on improving the code. To explore how teachers generally proceed when creating programming tasks, whether tool support can help, and how it is perceived by teachers, we performed a pre-study with 26 and a main study with 59 teachers in training and the LitterBox static analysis tool for Scratch. We find that teachers in training (1) often start with brainstorming thematic ideas rather than setting learning objectives, (2) write code before the task text, (3) give more hints in their task texts and create fewer bugs when supported by LitterBox, and (4) mention both positive aspects of the tool and suggestions for improvement. These findings provide an improved understanding of how to inform teacher training with respect to support needed by teachers when creating programming tasks.

> Node.js provides Node.js applications with system interaction capabilities using system calls. However, such convenience comes with a price, i.e., the attack surface of JavaScript arbitrary code execution (ACE) vulnerabilities is expanded to the system call level. There lies a noticeable gap between existing protection techniques in the JavaScript code level (either by code debloating or read-write-execute permission restriction) and a targeted defense for emerging critical system call level exploitation. To fill the gap, we design and implement HODOR, a lightweight runtime protection system based on enforcing precise system call restrictions when running a Node.js application. HODOR achieved this by addressing several nontrivialial technical challenges. First, HODOR requires to construct high-quality call graphs for both the Node.js application (in JavaScript) and its underlying Node.js framework (in JavaScript and C/C++). Specifically, HODOR incorporates several important optimizations in both the JavaScript and C/C++ level to improve the state-of-the-art tools for building more precise call graphs. Then, HODOR creates the main-thread whitelist and the thread-pool whitelist respectively containing the identified necessary system calls based on the call graphs mappings. Finally, with the whitelists, HODOR implements lightweight system call restriction using the Linux kernel feature Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) to shrink the attack surface. We utilize HODOR to protect 83 real-world Node.js applications compromised by arbitrary code/command execution attacks. HODOR could reduce the attack surface to 16.75% on average with negligible runtime overhead (i.e., <3%).

> Deep learning (DL) has been a revolutionary technique in various domains. To facilitate the model development and deployment, many deep learning frameworks are proposed, among which PyTorch is one of the most popular solutions. The performance of ecosystem around PyTorch is critically important, which saves the costs of training models and reduces the response time of model inferences. In this paper, we propose TorchBench, a novel benchmark suite to study the performance of PyTorch software stack. Unlike existing benchmark suites, TorchBench encloses many representative models, covering a large PyTorch API surface. TorchBench is able to comprehensively characterize the performance of the PyTorch software stack, guiding the performance optimization across models, PyTorch framework, and GPU libraries. We show two practical use cases of TorchBench. (1) We profile TorchBench to identify GPU performance inefficiencies in PyTorch. We are able to optimize many performance bugs and upstream patches to the official PyTorch repository. (2) We integrate TorchBench into PyTorch continuous integration system. We are able to identify performance regression in multiple daily code checkins to prevent PyTorch repository from introducing performance bugs. TorchBench is open source and keeps evolving.

> Recent research has shown that hardware fuzzers can effectively detect security vulnerabilities in modern processors. However, existing hardware fuzzers do not fuzz well the hard-to-reach design spaces. Consequently, these fuzzers cannot effectively fuzz security-critical control- and data-flow logic in the processors, hence missing security vulnerabilities. To tackle this challenge, we present HyPFuzz, a hybrid fuzzer that leverages formal verification tools to help fuzz the hard-to-reach part of the processors. To increase the effectiveness of HyPFuzz, we perform optimizations in time and space. First, we develop a scheduling strategy to prevent under- or over-utilization of the capabilities of formal tools and fuzzers. Second, we develop heuristic strategies to select points in the design space for the formal tool to target. We evaluate HyPFuzz on five widely-used open-source processors. HyPFuzz detected all the vulnerabilities detected by the most recent processor fuzzer and found three new vulnerabilities that were missed by previous extensive fuzzing and formal verification. This led to two new common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) entries. HyPFuzz also achieves 11.68$\times$ faster coverage than the most recent processor fuzzer.

> Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) has various applications, including but not limited to vulnerability detection, plagiarism detection, and malware detection. Previous research efforts mainly focus on transforming binary code to assembly code strings using reverse compilation and then using pre-trained deep learning models with large parameters to obtain feature representation vector of binary code. While these models have proven to be effective in representing binary code, their large parameter size leads to considerable computational expenses during both training and inference. In this paper, we present a lightweight neural network, called FastBCSD, that employs a dynamic instruction vector encoding method and takes only assembly code as input feature to achieve comparable accuracy to the pre-training models while reducing the computational resources and time cost.   On the BinaryCorp dataset, our method achieves a similar average MRR score to the state-of-the-art pre-training-based method (jTrans), while on the BinaryCorp 3M dataset, our method even outperforms the latest technology by 0.01. Notably, FastBCSD has a much smaller parameter size (13.4M) compared to jTrans (87.88M), and its latency time is 1/5 of jTrans on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.

> Recent studies give more attention to the anomaly detection (AD) methods that can leverage a handful of labeled anomalies along with abundant unlabeled data. These existing anomaly-informed AD methods rely on manually predefined score target(s), e.g., prior constant or margin hyperparameter(s), to realize discrimination in anomaly scores between normal and abnormal data. However, such methods would be vulnerable to the existence of anomaly contamination in the unlabeled data, and also lack adaptation to different data scenarios. In this paper, we propose to optimize the anomaly scoring function from the view of score distribution, thus better retaining the diversity and more fine-grained information of input data, especially when the unlabeled data contains anomaly noises in more practical AD scenarios. We design a novel loss function called Overlap loss that minimizes the overlap area between the score distributions of normal and abnormal samples, which no longer depends on prior anomaly score targets and thus acquires adaptability to various datasets. Overlap loss consists of Score Distribution Estimator and Overlap Area Calculation, which are introduced to overcome challenges when estimating arbitrary score distributions, and to ensure the boundness of training loss. As a general loss component, Overlap loss can be effectively integrated into multiple network architectures for constructing AD models. Extensive experimental results indicate that Overlap loss based AD models significantly outperform their state-of-the-art counterparts, and achieve better performance on different types of anomalies.

> Changes in source code are an inevitable part of software development. They are the results of indispensable activities such as fixing bugs or improving functionality. Descriptions for code changes (commit messages) help people better understand the changes. However, due to a lack of motivation and time pressure, writing high-quality commit messages remains reluctantly considered. Several methods have been proposed with the aim of automated commit message generation.   However, the existing methods are still limited because they only utilise either the changed code or the changed code combined with surrounding statements.   This paper proposes a method to represent code changes by combining the changed code and the unchanged code which have program dependence on the changed code. This method overcomes the limitations of current representations while improving the performance of 5/6 of state-of-the-art commit message generation methods by up to 15% in METEOR, 14% in ROUGE-L, and 10% in BLEU-4.

> In the last year alone, a surge of new benchmarks to measure compositional understanding of vision-language models have permeated the machine learning ecosystem. Given an image, these benchmarks probe a model's ability to identify its associated caption amongst a set of compositional distractors. Surprisingly, we find significant biases in all these benchmarks rendering them hackable. This hackability is so dire that blind models with no access to the image outperform state-of-the-art vision-language models. To remedy this rampant vulnerability, we introduce SugarCrepe, a new benchmark for vision-language compositionality evaluation. We employ large language models, instead of rule-based templates used in previous benchmarks, to generate fluent and sensical hard negatives, and utilize an adversarial refinement mechanism to maximally reduce biases. We re-evaluate state-of-the-art models and recently proposed compositionality inducing strategies, and find that their improvements were hugely overestimated, suggesting that more innovation is needed in this important direction. We release SugarCrepe and the code for evaluation at: https://github.com/RAIVNLab/sugar-crepe.

> Patient monitoring in intensive care units, although assisted by biosensors, needs continuous supervision of staff. To reduce the burden on staff members, IT infrastructures are built to record monitoring data and develop clinical decision support systems. These systems, however, are vulnerable to artifacts (e.g. muscle movement due to ongoing treatment), which are often indistinguishable from real and potentially dangerous signals. Video recordings could facilitate the reliable classification of biosignals using object detection (OD) methods to find sources of unwanted artifacts. Due to privacy restrictions, only blurred videos can be stored, which severely impairs the possibility to detect clinically relevant events such as interventions or changes in patient status with standard OD methods. Hence, new kinds of approaches are necessary that exploit every kind of available information due to the reduced information content of blurred footage and that are at the same time easily implementable within the IT infrastructure of a normal hospital. In this paper, we propose a new method for exploiting information in the temporal succession of video frames. To be efficiently implementable using off-the-shelf object detectors that comply with given hardware constraints, we repurpose the image color channels to account for temporal consistency, leading to an improved detection rate of the object classes. Our method outperforms a standard YOLOv5 baseline model by +1.7% mAP@.5 while also training over ten times faster on our proprietary dataset. We conclude that this approach has shown effectiveness in the preliminary experiments and holds potential for more general video OD in the future.

> In recent years, a number of process-based anomaly detection schemes for Industrial Control Systems were proposed. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of such schemes, and introduce a taxonomy of properties that are verified by those detection systems. We then present a novel general framework to generate adversarial spoofing signals that violate physical properties of the system, and use the framework to analyze four anomaly detectors published at top security conferences. We find that three of those detectors are susceptible to a number of adversarial manipulations (e.g., spoofing with precomputed patterns), which we call Synthetic Sensor Spoofing and one is resilient against our attacks. We investigate the root of its resilience and demonstrate that it comes from the properties that we introduced. Our attacks reduce the Recall (True Positive Rate) of the attacked schemes making them not able to correctly detect anomalies. Thus, the vulnerabilities we discovered in the anomaly detectors show that (despite an original good detection performance), those detectors are not able to reliably learn physical properties of the system. Even attacks that prior work was expected to be resilient against (based on verified properties) were found to be successful. We argue that our findings demonstrate the need for both more complete attacks in datasets, and more critical analysis of process-based anomaly detectors. We plan to release our implementation as open-source, together with an extension of two public datasets with a set of Synthetic Sensor Spoofing attacks as generated by our framework.

> Recent advances in automated vulnerability detection have achieved potential results in helping developers determine vulnerable components. However, after detecting vulnerabilities, investigating to fix vulnerable code is a non-trivial task. In fact, the types of vulnerability, such as buffer overflow or memory corruption, could help developers quickly understand the nature of the weaknesses and localize vulnerabilities for security analysis. In this work, we investigate the problem of vulnerability type identification (VTI). The problem is modeled as the multi-label classification task, which could be effectively addressed by "pre-training, then fine-tuning" framework with deep pre-trained embedding models. We evaluate the performance of the well-known and advanced pre-trained models for VTI on a large set of vulnerabilities. Surprisingly, their performance is not much better than that of the classical baseline approach with an old-fashioned bag-of-word, TF-IDF. Meanwhile, these deep neural network approaches cost much more resources and require GPU. We also introduce a lightweight independent component to refine the predictions of the baseline approach. Our idea is that the types of vulnerabilities could strongly correlate to certain code tokens (distinguishing tokens) in several crucial parts of programs. The distinguishing tokens for each vulnerability type are statistically identified based on their prevalence in the type versus the others. Our results show that the baseline approach enhanced by our component can outperform the state-of-the-art deep pre-trained approaches while retaining very high efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed component could also improve the neural network approaches by up to 92.8% in macro-average F1.

> Modern automotive functions are controlled by a large number of small computers called electronic control units (ECUs). These functions span from safety-critical autonomous driving to comfort and infotainment. ECUs communicate with one another over multiple internal networks using different technologies. Some, such as Controller Area Network (CAN), are very simple and provide minimal or no security services. Machine learning techniques can be used to detect anomalous activities in such networks. However, it is necessary that these machine learning techniques are not prone to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate adversarial sample vulnerabilities in four different machine learning-based intrusion detection systems for automotive networks. We show that adversarial samples negatively impact three of the four studied solutions. Furthermore, we analyze transferability of adversarial samples between different systems. We also investigate detection performance and the attack success rate after using adversarial samples in the training. After analyzing these results, we discuss whether current solutions are mature enough for a use in modern vehicles.

> Cyber-physical microgrids are vulnerable to rootkit attacks that manipulate system dynamics to create instabilities in the network. Rootkits tend to hide their access level within microgrid system components to launch sudden attacks that prey on the slow response time of defenders to manipulate system trajectory. This problem can be formulated as a multi-stage, non-cooperative, zero-sum game with the attacker and the defender modeled as opposing players. To solve the game, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based strategy that dynamically identifies rootkit access levels and isolates incoming manipulations by incorporating changes in the defense plan. A major advantage of the proposed strategy is its ability to establish resiliency without altering the physical transmission/distribution network topology, thereby diminishing potential instability issues. The paper also presents several simulation results and case studies to demonstrate the operating mechanism and robustness of the proposed strategy.

> Recent works have demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To defend against adversarial attacks, many defense strategies have been proposed, among which adversarial training has been demonstrated to be the most effective strategy. However, it has been known that adversarial training sometimes hurts natural accuracy. Then, many works focus on optimizing model parameters to handle the problem. Different from the previous approaches, in this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the adversarial robustness by using an external signal rather than model parameters. In the proposed method, a well-optimized universal external signal called a booster signal is injected into the outside of the image which does not overlap with the original content. Then, it boosts both adversarial robustness and natural accuracy. The booster signal is optimized in parallel to model parameters step by step collaboratively. Experimental results show that the booster signal can improve both the natural and robust accuracies over the recent state-of-the-art adversarial training methods. Also, optimizing the booster signal is general and flexible enough to be adopted on any existing adversarial training methods.

> Recently, it has been widely known that deep neural networks are highly vulnerable and easily broken by adversarial attacks. To mitigate the adversarial vulnerability, many defense algorithms have been proposed. Recently, to improve adversarial robustness, many works try to enhance feature representation by imposing more direct supervision on the discriminative feature. However, existing approaches lack an understanding of learning adversarially robust feature representation. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called Robust Proxy Learning. In the proposed method, the model explicitly learns robust feature representations with robust proxies. To this end, firstly, we demonstrate that we can generate class-representative robust features by adding class-wise robust perturbations. Then, we use the class representative features as robust proxies. With the class-wise robust features, the model explicitly learns adversarially robust features through the proposed robust proxy learning framework. Through extensive experiments, we verify that we can manually generate robust features, and our proposed learning framework could increase the robustness of the DNNs.

> We introduce the Deep Learning Vulnerability Analyzer (DLVA) for Ethereum smart contracts based on neural networks. We train DLVA to judge bytecode even though the supervising oracle can only judge source. DLVA's training algorithm is general: we extend a source code analysis to bytecode without any manual feature engineering, predefined patterns, or expert rules. DLVA's training algorithm is also robust: it overcame a 1.25% error rate mislabeled contracts, and--the student surpassing the teacher--found vulnerable contracts that Slither mislabeled. DLVA is much faster than other smart contract vulnerability detectors: DLVA checks contracts for 29 vulnerabilities in 0.2 seconds, a 10-1,000x speedup. DLVA has three key components. First, Smart Contract to Vector (SC2V) uses neural networks to map smart contract bytecode to a high-dimensional floating-point vector. We benchmark SC2V against 4 state-of-the-art graph neural networks and show that it improves model differentiation by 2.2%. Second, Sibling Detector (SD) classifies contracts when a target contract's vector is Euclidian-close to a labeled contract's vector in a training set; although only able to judge 55.7% of the contracts in our test set, it has a Slither-predictive accuracy of 97.4% with a false positive rate of only 0.1%. Third, Core Classifier (CC) uses neural networks to infer vulnerable contracts regardless of vector distance. We benchmark DLVA's CC with 10 ML techniques and show that the CC improves accuracy by 11.3%. Overall, DLVA predicts Slither's labels with an overall accuracy of 92.7% and associated false positive rate of 7.2%. Lastly, we benchmark DLVA against nine well-known smart contract analysis tools. Despite using much less analysis time, DLVA completed every query, leading the pack with an average accuracy of 99.7%, pleasingly balancing high true positive rates with low false positive rates.

> Our ISCA 2014 paper provided the first scientific and detailed characterization, analysis, and real-system demonstration of what is now popularly known as the RowHammer phenomenon (or vulnerability) in modern commodity DRAM chips, which are used as main memory in almost all modern computing systems. It experimentally demonstrated that more than 80% of all DRAM modules we tested from the three major DRAM vendors were vulnerable to the RowHammer read disturbance phenomenon: one can predictably induce bitflips (i.e., data corruption) in real DRAM modules by repeatedly accessing a DRAM row and thus causing electrical disturbance to physically nearby rows. We showed that a simple unprivileged user-level program induced RowHammer bitflips in multiple real systems and suggested that a security attack can be built using this proof-of-concept to hijack control of the system or cause other harm. To solve the RowHammer problem, our paper examined seven different approaches (including a novel probabilistic approach that has very low cost), some of which influenced or were adopted in different industrial products.   Many later works from various research communities examined RowHammer, building real security attacks, proposing new defenses, further analyzing the problem at various (e.g., device/circuit, architecture, and system) levels, and exploiting RowHammer for various purposes (e.g., to reverse-engineer DRAM chips). Industry has worked to mitigate the problem, changing both memory controllers and DRAM standards/chips. Two major DRAM vendors finally wrote papers on the topic in 2023, describing their current approaches to mitigate RowHammer. Research & development on RowHammer in both academia & industry continues to be very active and fascinating.   This short retrospective provides a brief analysis of our ISCA 2014 paper and its impact.

> The current hardware landscape and application scale is driving performance engineers towards writing bespoke optimizations. Verifying such optimizations, and generating minimal failing cases, is important for robustness in the face of changing program conditions, such as inputs and sizes. However, isolation of minimal test-cases from existing applications and generating new configurations are often difficult due to side effects on the system state, mostly related to dataflow. This paper introduces FuzzyFlow: a fault localization and test case extraction framework designed to test program optimizations. We leverage dataflow program representations to capture a fully reproducible system state and area-of-effect for optimizations to enable fast checking for semantic equivalence. To reduce testing time, we design an algorithm for minimizing test inputs, trading off memory for recomputation. We demonstrate FuzzyFlow on example use cases in real-world applications where the approach provides up to 528 times faster optimization testing and debugging compared to traditional approaches.

- `2203.05566v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05566v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05566v2)

> Testing video games is an increasingly difficult task as traditional methods fail to scale with growing software systems. Manual testing is a very labor-intensive process, and therefore quickly becomes cost prohibitive. Using scripts for automated testing is affordable, however scripts are ineffective in non-deterministic environments, and knowing when to run each test is another problem altogether. The modern game's complexity, scope, and player expectations are rapidly increasing where quality control is a big portion of the production cost and delivery risk. Reducing this risk and making production happen is a big challenge for the industry currently. To keep production costs realistic up-to and after release, we are focusing on preventive quality assurance tactics alongside testing and data analysis automation. We present SUPERNOVA (Selection of tests and Universal defect Prevention in External Repositories for Novel Objective Verification of software Anomalies), a system responsible for test selection and defect prevention while also functioning as an automation hub. By integrating data analysis functionality with machine and deep learning capability, SUPERNOVA assists quality assurance testers in finding bugs and developers in reducing defects, which improves stability during the production cycle and keeps testing costs under control. The direct impact of this has been observed to be a reduction in 55% or more testing hours for an undisclosed sports game title that has shipped, which was using these test selection optimizations. Furthermore, using risk scores generated by a semi-supervised machine learning model, we are able to detect with 71% precision and 77% recall the probability of a change-list being bug inducing, and provide a detailed breakdown of this inference to developers. These efforts improve workflow and reduce testing hours required on game titles in development.

> Deep Neural Networks are powerful tools to understand complex patterns and making decisions. However, their black-box nature impedes a complete understanding of their inner workings. While online saliency-guided training methods try to highlight the prominent features in the model's output to alleviate this problem, it is still ambiguous if the visually explainable features align with robustness of the model against adversarial examples. In this paper, we investigate the saliency trained model's vulnerability to adversarial examples methods. Models are trained using an online saliency-guided training method and evaluated against popular algorithms of adversarial examples. We quantify the robustness and conclude that despite the well-explained visualizations in the model's output, the salient models suffer from the lower performance against adversarial examples attacks.

- `2207.07292v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07292v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07292v2)

> Federated Learning (FL) as a secure distributed learning framework gains interests in Internet of Things (IoT) due to its capability of protecting the privacy of participant data. However, traditional FL systems are vulnerable to Free-Rider (FR) attacks, which causes unfairness, privacy leakage and inferior performance to FL systems. The prior defense mechanisms against FR attacks assumed that malicious clients (namely, adversaries) declare less than 50% of the total amount of clients. Moreover, they aimed for Anonymous FR (AFR) attacks and lost effectiveness in resisting Selfish FR (SFR) attacks. In this paper, we propose a Parameter Audit-based Secure and fair federated learning Scheme (PASS) against FR attack. PASS has the following key features: (a) prevent from privacy leakage with less accuracy loss; (b) be effective in countering both AFR and SFR attacks; (c) work well no matter whether AFR and SFR adversaries occupy the majority of clients or not. Extensive experimental results validate that PASS: (a) has the same level as the State-Of-The-Art method in mean square error against privacy leakage; (b) defends against AFR and SFR attacks in terms of a higher defense success rate, lower false positive rate, and higher F1-score; (c) is still effective where adversaries exceed 50%, with F1-score 89% against AFR attack and F1-score 87% against SFR attack. Note that PASS produces no negative effect on FL accuracy when there is no FR adversary.

> Cloud platforms are widely adopted by many systems, such as time series processing systems, to store and process massive amounts of sensitive time series data. Unfortunately, several incidents have shown that cloud platforms are vulnerable to internal and external attacks that lead to critical data breaches. Adopting cryptographic protocols such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation adds high computational and network overhead to query operations.   We present TimeClave, a fully oblivious in-enclave time series processing system: TimeClave leverages Intel SGX to support aggregate statistics on time series with minimal memory consumption inside the enclave. To hide the access pattern inside the enclave, we introduce a non-blocking read-optimised ORAM named RoORAM. TimeClave integrates RoORAM to obliviously and securely handle client queries with high performance. With an aggregation time interval of $10s$, $2^{14}$ summarised data blocks and 8 aggregate functions, TimeClave run point query in $0.03ms$ and a range query of 50 intervals in $0.46ms$. Compared to the ORAM baseline, TimeClave achieves lower query latency by up to $2.5\times$ and up to $2\times$ throughput, with up to 22K queries per second.

> The vulnerability of deep neural network models to adversarial example attacks is a practical challenge in many artificial intelligence applications. A recent line of work shows that the use of randomization in adversarial training is the key to find optimal strategies against adversarial example attacks. However, in a fully randomized setting where both the defender and the attacker can use randomized strategies, there are no efficient algorithm for finding such an optimal strategy. To fill the gap, we propose the first algorithm of its kind, called FRAT, which models the problem with a new infinite-dimensional continuous-time flow on probability distribution spaces. FRAT maintains a lightweight mixture of models for the defender, with flexibility to efficiently update mixing weights and model parameters at each iteration. Furthermore, FRAT utilizes lightweight sampling subroutines to construct a random strategy for the attacker. We prove that the continuous-time limit of FRAT converges to a mixed Nash equilibria in a zero-sum game formed by a defender and an attacker. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of FRAT on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

> Software testing activities scrutinize the artifacts and the behavior of a software product to find possible defects and ensure that the product meets its expected requirements. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been successfully employed in complex testing tasks such as game testing, regression testing, and test case prioritization to automate the process and provide continuous adaptation. Practitioners can employ DRL by implementing from scratch a DRL algorithm or using a DRL framework. DRL frameworks offer well-maintained implemented state-of-the-art DRL algorithms to facilitate and speed up the development of DRL applications. Developers have widely used these frameworks to solve problems in various domains including software testing. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that empirically evaluates the effectiveness and performance of implemented algorithms in DRL frameworks. Moreover, some guidelines are lacking from the literature that would help practitioners choose one DRL framework over another. In this paper, we empirically investigate the applications of carefully selected DRL algorithms on two important software testing tasks: test case prioritization in the context of Continuous Integration (CI) and game testing. For the game testing task, we conduct experiments on a simple game and use DRL algorithms to explore the game to detect bugs. Results show that some of the selected DRL frameworks such as Tensorforce outperform recent approaches in the literature. To prioritize test cases, we run experiments on a CI environment where DRL algorithms from different frameworks are used to rank the test cases. Our results show that the performance difference between implemented algorithms in some cases is considerable, motivating further investigation.

> Recent years have witnessed the fast penetration of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) systems into our daily life, the security and privacy issues of the VR/AR applications have been attracting considerable attention. Most VR/AR systems adopt head-mounted devices (i.e., smart headsets) to interact with users and the devices usually store the users' private data. Hence, authentication schemes are desired for the head-mounted devices. Traditional knowledge-based authentication schemes for general personal devices have been proved vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks, especially considering the headsets may block the sight of the users. Although the robustness of the knowledge-based authentication can be improved by designing complicated secret codes in virtual space, this approach induces a compromise of usability. Another choice is to leverage the users' biometrics; however, it either relies on highly advanced equipments which may not always be available in commercial headsets or introduce heavy cognitive load to users.   In this paper, we propose a vibration-based authentication scheme, VibHead, for smart headsets. Since the propagation of vibration signals through human heads presents unique patterns for different individuals, VibHead employs a CNN-based model to classify registered legitimate users based the features extracted from the vibration signals. We also design a two-step authentication scheme where the above user classifiers are utilized to distinguish the legitimate user from illegitimate ones. We implement VibHead on a Microsoft HoloLens equipped with a linear motor and an IMU sensor which are commonly used in off-the-shelf personal smart devices. According to the results of our extensive experiments, with short vibration signals ($\leq 1s$), VibHead has an outstanding authentication accuracy; both FAR and FRR are around 5%.

> ML models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial query attacks. In these attacks, queries are iteratively perturbed towards a particular class without any knowledge of the target model besides its output. The prevalence of remotely-hosted ML classification models and Machine-Learning-as-a-Service platforms means that query attacks pose a real threat to the security of these systems. To deal with this, stateful defenses have been proposed to detect query attacks and prevent the generation of adversarial examples by monitoring and analyzing the sequence of queries received by the system. Several stateful defenses have been proposed in recent years. However, these defenses rely solely on similarity or out-of-distribution detection methods that may be effective in other domains. In the malware detection domain, the methods to generate adversarial examples are inherently different, and therefore we find that such detection mechanisms are significantly less effective. Hence, in this paper, we present MalProtect, which is a stateful defense against query attacks in the malware detection domain. MalProtect uses several threat indicators to detect attacks. Our results show that it reduces the evasion rate of adversarial query attacks by 80+\% in Android and Windows malware, across a range of attacker scenarios. In the first evaluation of its kind, we show that MalProtect outperforms prior stateful defenses, especially under the peak adversarial threat.

> Source code diffs are used on a daily basis as part of code review, inspection, and auditing. To facilitate understanding, they are typically accompanied by explanations that describe the essence of what is changed in the program. As manually crafting high-quality explanations is a cumbersome task, researchers have proposed automatic techniques to generate code diff explanations. Existing explanation generation methods solely focus on static analysis, i.e., they do not take advantage of runtime information to explain code changes. In this paper, we propose Collector-Sahab, a novel tool that augments code diffs with runtime difference information. Collector-Sahab compares the program states of the original (old) and patched (new) versions of a program to find unique variable values. Then, Collector-Sahab adds this novel runtime information to the source code diff as shown, for instance, in code reviewing systems. As an evaluation, we run Collector-Sahab on 584 code diffs for Defects4J bugs and find it successfully augments the code diff for 95% (555/584) of them. We also perform a user study and ask eight participants to score the augmented code diffs generated by Collector-Sahab. Per this user study, we conclude that developers find the idea of adding runtime data to code diffs promising and useful. Overall, our experiments show the effectiveness and usefulness of Collector-Sahab in augmenting code diffs with runtime difference information.

> Smart contracts are programs that execute transactions involving independent parties and cryptocurrencies. As programs, smart contracts are susceptible to a wide range of errors and vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities can result in significant losses. Furthermore, by design, smart contract transactions are irreversible. This creates a need for methods to ensure the correctness and security of contracts pre-deployment. Recently there has been substantial research into such methods. The sheer volume of this research makes articulating state-of-the-art a substantial undertaking. To address this challenge, we present a systematic review of the literature. A key feature of our presentation is to factor out the relationship between vulnerabilities and methods through properties. Specifically, we enumerate and classify smart contract vulnerabilities and methods by the properties they address. The methods considered include static analysis as well as dynamic analysis methods and machine learning algorithms that analyze smart contracts before deployment. Several patterns about the strengths of different methods emerge through this classification process.

> From simulating galaxy formation to viral transmission in a pandemic, scientific models play a pivotal role in developing scientific theories and supporting government policy decisions that affect us all. Given these critical applications, a poor modelling assumption or bug could have far-reaching consequences. However, scientific models possess several properties that make them notoriously difficult to test, including a complex input space, long execution times, and non-determinism, rendering existing testing techniques impractical. In fields such as epidemiology, where researchers seek answers to challenging causal questions, a statistical methodology known as Causal Inference has addressed similar problems, enabling the inference of causal conclusions from noisy, biased, and sparse data instead of costly experiments. This paper introduces the Causal Testing Framework: a framework that uses Causal Inference techniques to establish causal effects from existing data, enabling users to conduct software testing activities concerning the effect of a change, such as Metamorphic Testing, a posteriori. We present three case studies covering real-world scientific models, demonstrating how the Causal Testing Framework can infer metamorphic test outcomes from reused, confounded test data to provide an efficient solution for testing scientific modelling software.

> The proliferation of deep learning applications in healthcare calls for data aggregation across various institutions, a practice often associated with significant privacy concerns. This concern intensifies in medical image analysis, where privacy-preserving mechanisms are paramount due to the data being sensitive in nature. Federated learning, which enables cooperative model training without direct data exchange, presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerabilities of federated learning necessitate further privacy safeguards. This study addresses this need by integrating differential privacy, a leading privacy-preserving technique, into a federated learning framework for medical image classification. We introduce a novel differentially private federated learning model and meticulously examine its impacts on privacy preservation and model performance. Our research confirms the existence of a trade-off between model accuracy and privacy settings. However, we demonstrate that strategic calibration of the privacy budget in differential privacy can uphold robust image classification performance while providing substantial privacy protection.

> Post-quantum security is critical in the quantum era. Quantum computers, along with quantum algorithms, make the standard cryptography based on RSA or ECDSA over FL or Blockchain vulnerable. The implementation of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) over such systems is poorly understood as PQC is still in its standardization phase. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to employ PQC over blockchain-based FL (BFL), where we combine a stateless signature scheme like Dilithium (or Falcon) with a stateful hash-based signature scheme like the extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). We propose a linear-based formulaic approach to device role selection mechanisms based on multiple factors to address the performance aspect. Our holistic approach of utilizing a verifiable random function (VRF) to assist in the blockchain consensus mechanism shows the practicality of the proposed approaches. The proposed method and extensive experimental results contribute to enhancing the security and performance aspects of BFL systems.

> Extensive studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial and natural noises, yet little is known about model robustness on noises caused by different system implementations. In this paper, we for the first time introduce SysNoise, a frequently occurred but often overlooked noise in the deep learning training-deployment cycle. In particular, SysNoise happens when the source training system switches to a disparate target system in deployments, where various tiny system mismatch adds up to a non-negligible difference. We first identify and classify SysNoise into three categories based on the inference stage; we then build a holistic benchmark to quantitatively measure the impact of SysNoise on 20+ models, comprehending image classification, object detection, instance segmentation and natural language processing tasks. Our extensive experiments revealed that SysNoise could bring certain impacts on model robustness across different tasks and common mitigations like data augmentation and adversarial training show limited effects on it. Together, our findings open a new research topic and we hope this work will raise research attention to deep learning deployment systems accounting for model performance. We have open-sourced the benchmark and framework at https://modeltc.github.io/systemnoise_web.

> Recent research efforts indicate that federated learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to a variety of security breaches. While numerous defense strategies have been suggested, they are mainly designed to counter specific attack patterns and lack adaptability, rendering them less effective when facing uncertain or adaptive threats. This work models adversarial FL as a Bayesian Stackelberg Markov game (BSMG) between the defender and the attacker to address the lack of adaptability to uncertain adaptive attacks. We further devise an effective meta-learning technique to solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium, leading to a resilient and adaptable defense. The experiment results suggest that our meta-Stackelberg learning approach excels in combating intense model poisoning and backdoor attacks of indeterminate types.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been showed to be highly vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial perturbations. As a complementary type of adversary, patch attacks that introduce perceptible perturbations to the images have attracted the interest of researchers. Existing patch attacks rely on the architecture of the model or the probabilities of predictions and perform poorly in the decision-based setting, which can still construct a perturbation with the minimal information exposed -- the top-1 predicted label. In this work, we first explore the decision-based patch attack. To enhance the attack efficiency, we model the patches using paired key-points and use targeted images as the initialization of patches, and parameter optimizations are all performed on the integer domain. Then, we propose a differential evolutionary algorithm named DevoPatch for query-efficient decision-based patch attacks. Experiments demonstrate that DevoPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box patch attacks in terms of patch area and attack success rate within a given query budget on image classification and face verification. Additionally, we conduct the vulnerability evaluation of ViT and MLP on image classification in the decision-based patch attack setting for the first time. Using DevoPatch, we can evaluate the robustness of models to black-box patch attacks. We believe this method could inspire the design and deployment of robust vision models based on various DNN architectures in the future.

> Smart contracts play a vital role in the Ethereum ecosystem. Due to the prevalence of kinds of security issues in smart contracts, the smart contract verification is urgently needed, which is the process of matching a smart contract's source code to its on-chain bytecode for gaining mutual trust between smart contract developers and users. Although smart contract verification services are embedded in both popular Ethereum browsers (e.g., Etherscan and Blockscout) and official platforms (i.e., Sourcify), and gain great popularity in the ecosystem, their security and trustworthiness remain unclear. To fill the void, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of smart contract verification services in the wild. By diving into the detailed workflow of existing verifiers, we have summarized the key security properties that should be met, and observed eight types of vulnerabilities that can break the verification. Further, we propose a series of detection and exploitation methods to reveal the presence of vulnerabilities in the most popular services, and uncover 19 exploitable vulnerabilities in total. All the studied smart contract verification services can be abused to help spread malicious smart contracts, and we have already observed the presence of using this kind of tricks for scamming by attackers. It is hence urgent for our community to take actions to detect and mitigate security issues related to smart contract verification, a key component of the Ethereum smart contract ecosystem.

> Fuzzing is a widely used software security testing technique that is designed to identify vulnerabilities in systems by providing invalid or unexpected input. Continuous fuzzing systems like OSS-FUZZ have been successful in finding security bugs in many different software systems. The typical process of finding security bugs using fuzzing involves several steps: first, the "fuzz-worthy" functions that are likely to contain vulnerabilities must be identified; second, the setup requirements for the API must be understood before it can be called; third, a fuzzing harness must be written and bound to a coverage-guided fuzzer like LLVM's LibFuzzer; and finally, the security bugs discovered by the fuzzing harness must be triaged and checked for reproducibility. This project focuses on automating the first two steps in this process. In particular, we present an automated system that can generate fuzzing harnesses for library APIs and binary protocol parsers by analyzing unit tests. This allows for the scaling of the fuzzing infrastructure in proportion to the growth of the codebase, without the need for manual coding of harnesses. Additionally, we develop a metric to assess the "fuzz-worthiness" of an API, enabling us to prioritize the most promising targets for testing.

> Transformer-based text classifiers like BERT, Roberta, T5, and GPT-3 have shown impressive performance in NLP. However, their vulnerability to adversarial examples poses a security risk. Existing defense methods lack interpretability, making it hard to understand adversarial classifications and identify model vulnerabilities. To address this, we propose the Interpretability and Transparency-Driven Detection and Transformation (IT-DT) framework. It focuses on interpretability and transparency in detecting and transforming textual adversarial examples. IT-DT utilizes techniques like attention maps, integrated gradients, and model feedback for interpretability during detection. This helps identify salient features and perturbed words contributing to adversarial classifications. In the transformation phase, IT-DT uses pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to generate optimal replacements for perturbed words. By finding suitable substitutions, we aim to convert adversarial examples into non-adversarial counterparts that align with the model's intended behavior while preserving the text's meaning. Transparency is emphasized through human expert involvement. Experts review and provide feedback on detection and transformation results, enhancing decision-making, especially in complex scenarios. The framework generates insights and threat intelligence empowering analysts to identify vulnerabilities and improve model robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IT-DT in detecting and transforming adversarial examples. The approach enhances interpretability, provides transparency, and enables accurate identification and successful transformation of adversarial inputs. By combining technical analysis and human expertise, IT-DT significantly improves the resilience and trustworthiness of transformer-based text classifiers against adversarial attacks.

> Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are made up of a large number of tiny sensors, which can sense, analyze, and communicate information about the outside world. These networks play a significant role in a broad range of fields, from crucial military surveillance applications to monitoring building security. Key management in WSNs is a critical task. While the security and integrity of messages communicated through these networks and the authenticity of the nodes are dependent on the robustness of the key management schemes, designing an efficient key generation, distribution, and revocation scheme is quite challenging. While resource-constrained sensor nodes should not be exposed to computationally demanding asymmetric key algorithms, the use of symmetric key-based systems leaves the entire network vulnerable to several attacks. This chapter provides a comprehensive survey of several well-known cryptographic mechanisms and key management schemes for WSNs.

> Generally, regularization-based continual learning models limit access to the previous task data to imitate the real-world constraints related to memory and privacy. However, this introduces a problem in these models by not being able to track the performance on each task. In essence, current continual learning methods are susceptible to attacks on previous tasks. We demonstrate the vulnerability of regularization-based continual learning methods by presenting a simple task-specific data poisoning attack that can be used in the learning process of a new task. Training data generated by the proposed attack causes performance degradation on a specific task targeted by the attacker. We experiment with the attack on the two representative regularization-based continual learning methods, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Synaptic Intelligence (SI), trained with variants of MNIST dataset. The experiment results justify the vulnerability proposed in this paper and demonstrate the importance of developing continual learning models that are robust to adversarial attacks.

> Distributed Collaborative Machine Learning (DCML) is a potential alternative to address the privacy concerns associated with centralized machine learning. The Split learning (SL) and Federated Learning (FL) are the two effective learning approaches in DCML. Recently there have been an increased interest on the hybrid of FL and SL known as the SplitFed Learning (SFL). This research is the earliest attempt to study, analyze and present the impact of data poisoning attacks in SFL. We propose three kinds of novel attack strategies namely untargeted, targeted and distance-based attacks for SFL. All the attacks strategies aim to degrade the performance of the DCML-based classifier. We test the proposed attack strategies for two different case studies on Electrocardiogram signal classification and automatic handwritten digit recognition. A series of attack experiments were conducted by varying the percentage of malicious clients and the choice of the model split layer between the clients and the server. The results after the comprehensive analysis of attack strategies clearly convey that untargeted and distance-based poisoning attacks have greater impacts in evading the classifier outcomes compared to targeted attacks in SFL

> Despite their promising performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, current NLP systems are vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks. To defend against these attacks, most existing methods apply adversarial training by incorporating adversarial examples. However, these methods have to rely on ground-truth labels to generate adversarial examples, rendering it impractical for large-scale model pre-training which is commonly used nowadays for NLP and many other tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called SCAT (Self-supervised Contrastive Learning via Adversarial Training), which can learn robust representations without requiring labeled data. Specifically, SCAT modifies random augmentations of the data in a fully labelfree manner to generate adversarial examples. Adversarial training is achieved by minimizing the contrastive loss between the augmentations and their adversarial counterparts. We evaluate SCAT on two text classification datasets using two state-of-the-art attack schemes proposed recently. Our results show that SCAT can not only train robust language models from scratch, but it can also significantly improve the robustness of existing pre-trained language models. Moreover, to demonstrate its flexibility, we show that SCAT can also be combined with supervised adversarial training to further enhance model robustness.

> Internet of things (IoT) has been playing an important role in many sectors, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing. However, IoT devices are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which may result in security breaches and data leakages. To effectively prevent these attacks, a variety of machine learning-based network intrusion detection methods for IoT networks have been developed, which often rely on either feature extraction or feature selection techniques for reducing the dimension of input data before being fed into machine learning models. This aims to make the detection complexity low enough for real-time operations, which is particularly vital in any intrusion detection systems. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between these two feature reduction methods of intrusion detection in terms of various performance metrics, namely, precision rate, recall rate, detection accuracy, as well as runtime complexity, in the presence of the modern UNSW-NB15 dataset as well as both binary and multiclass classification. For example, in general, the feature selection method not only provides better detection performance but also lower training and inference time compared to its feature extraction counterpart, especially when the number of reduced features K increases. However, the feature extraction method is much more reliable than its selection counterpart, particularly when K is very small, such as K = 4. Additionally, feature extraction is less sensitive to changing the number of reduced features K than feature selection, and this holds true for both binary and multiclass classifications. Based on this comparison, we provide a useful guideline for selecting a suitable intrusion detection type for each specific scenario, as detailed in Tab. 14 at the end of Section IV.

> Machine learning (ML) models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which determine whether a given input is used for training the target model. While there have been many efforts to mitigate MIAs, they often suffer from limited privacy protection, large accuracy drop, and/or requiring additional data that may be difficult to acquire. This work proposes a defense technique, HAMP that can achieve both strong membership privacy and high accuracy, without requiring extra data. To mitigate MIAs in different forms, we observe that they can be unified as they all exploit the ML model's overconfidence in predicting training samples through different proxies. This motivates our design to enforce less confident prediction by the model, hence forcing the model to behave similarly on the training and testing samples. HAMP consists of a novel training framework with high-entropy soft labels and an entropy-based regularizer to constrain the model's prediction while still achieving high accuracy. To further reduce privacy risk, HAMP uniformly modifies all the prediction outputs to become low-confidence outputs while preserving the accuracy, which effectively obscures the differences between the prediction on members and non-members. We conduct extensive evaluation on five benchmark datasets, and show that HAMP provides consistently high accuracy and strong membership privacy. Our comparison with seven state-of-the-art defenses shows that HAMP achieves a superior privacy-utility trade off than those techniques.

> In recent years, the number of cyber attacks has grown rapidly. An effective way to reduce the attack surface and protect software is adoption of methodologies that apply security at each step of the software development lifecycle. While different methodologies have been proposed to address software security, recent research shows an increase in the number of vulnerabilities in software and data breaches. Therefore, the security practices incorporated in secure software development methodologies require investigation. This paper provides an overview of security practices involved in 28 secure software development methodologies from industry, government, and academia. To achieve this goal, we distributed the security practices among the software development lifecycle stages. We also investigated auxiliary (non-technical) practices, such as organizational, behavioral, legal, policy, and governance aspects that are incorporated in the secure software development methodologies. Furthermore, we explored methods used to provide evidence of the effectiveness of the methodologies. Finally, we present the gaps that require attention in the scientific community. The results of our survey may assist researchers and organizations to better understand the existing security practices integrated into the secure software development methodologies. In addition, our bridge between "technical" and "non-technical" worlds may be useful for non-technical specialists who investigate software security. Moreover, exploring the gaps that we found in current research may help improve security in software development and produce software with fewer number of vulnerabilities.

> Indoor localization plays a vital role in applications such as emergency response, warehouse management, and augmented reality experiences. By deploying machine learning (ML) based indoor localization frameworks on their mobile devices, users can localize themselves in a variety of indoor and subterranean environments. However, achieving accurate indoor localization can be challenging due to heterogeneity in the hardware and software stacks of mobile devices, which can result in inconsistent and inaccurate location estimates. Traditional ML models also heavily rely on initial training data, making them vulnerable to degradation in performance with dynamic changes across indoor environments. To address the challenges due to device heterogeneity and lack of adaptivity, we propose a novel embedded ML framework called FedHIL. Our framework combines indoor localization and federated learning (FL) to improve indoor localization accuracy in device-heterogeneous environments while also preserving user data privacy. FedHIL integrates a domain-specific selective weight adjustment approach to preserve the ML model's performance for indoor localization during FL, even in the presence of extremely noisy data. Experimental evaluations in diverse real-world indoor environments and with heterogeneous mobile devices show that FedHIL outperforms state-of-the-art FL and non-FL indoor localization frameworks. FedHIL is able to achieve 1.62x better localization accuracy on average than the best performing FL-based indoor localization framework from prior work.

> Background: In modern software systems, more and more systems are written in multiple programming languages (PLs). There is no comprehensive investigation on the phenomenon of multi-programming-language (MPL) bugs, which resolution involves source files written in multiple PLs. Aim: This work investigated the characteristics of bug resolution in MPL software systems and explored the reasons why bug resolution involves multiple PLs. Method: We conducted an empirical study on 54 MPL projects selected from 655 Apache OSS projects, of which 66,932 bugs were analyzed. Results: (1) the percentage of MPL bugs (MPLBs) in the selected projects ranges from 0.17% to 42.26%, and the percentage of MPLBs for all projects as a whole is 10.01%; (2) 95.0% and 4.5% of all the MPLBs involve source files written in 2 and 3 PLs, respectively; (3) the change complexity resolution characteristics of MPLBs tend to be higher than those of single-programming-language bugs (SPLBs); (4) the open time for MPLBs is 19.52% to 529.57% significantly longer than SPLBs regarding 9 PL combinations; (5) the reopen rate of bugs involving the PL combination of JavaScript and Python reaches 20.66%; (6) we found 6 causes why the bug resolution involves multiple PLs and identified 5 cross-language calling mechanisms.

> Background: Reliable prediction of clinical progression over time can improve the outcomes of depression. Little work has been done integrating various risk factors for depression, to determine the combinations of factors with the greatest utility for identifying which individuals are at the greatest risk. Method: This study demonstrates that data-driven machine learning (ML) methods such as RE-EM (Random Effects/Expectation Maximization) trees and MERF (Mixed Effects Random Forest) can be applied to reliably identify variables that have the greatest utility for classifying subgroups at greatest risk for depression. 185 young adults completed measures of depression risk, including rumination, worry, negative cognitive styles, cognitive and coping flexibilities, and negative life events, along with symptoms of depression. We trained RE-EM trees and MERF algorithms and compared them to traditional linear mixed models (LMMs) predicting depressive symptoms prospectively and concurrently with cross-validation. Results: Our results indicated that the RE-EM tree and MERF methods model complex interactions, identify subgroups of individuals and predict depression severity comparable to LMM. Further, machine learning models determined that brooding, negative life events, negative cognitive styles, and perceived control were the most relevant predictors of future depression levels. Conclusions: Random effects machine learning models have the potential for high clinical utility and can be leveraged for interventions to reduce vulnerability to depression.

> Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates are becoming essential for electric/electronic vehicle architectures in order to reduce recalls amid the increasing software bugs and vulnerabilities. Current OTA update architectures rely heavily on direct cellular repository-to-vehicle links, which makes the repository a communication bottleneck, and increases the cellular bandwidth utilization cost as well as the software download latency. In this paper, we introduce ScalOTA, an end-to-end scalable OTA software update architecture and secure protocol for modern vehicles. For the first time, we propose using a network of update stations, as part of Electric Vehicle charging stations, to boost the download speed through these stations, and reduce the cellular bandwidth overhead significantly. Our formalized OTA update protocol ensures proven end-to-end chain-of-trust including all stakeholders: manufacturer, suppliers, update stations, and all layers of in-vehicle Electric Control Units (ECUs). The empirical evaluation shows that ScalOTA reduces the bandwidth utilization and download latency up to an order of magnitude compared with current OTA update systems.

> Recent research has shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly vulnerable to adversarial samples, which are highly transferable and can be used to attack other unknown black-box models. To improve the transferability of adversarial samples, several feature-based adversarial attack methods have been proposed to disrupt neuron activation in the middle layers. However, current state-of-the-art feature-based attack methods typically require additional computation costs for estimating the importance of neurons. To address this challenge, we propose a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based feature-level attack method. Our approach is inspired by the discovery that eigenvectors associated with the larger singular values decomposed from the middle layer features exhibit superior generalization and attention properties. Specifically, we conduct the attack by retaining the decomposed Top-1 singular value-associated feature for computing the output logits, which are then combined with the original logits to optimize adversarial examples. Our extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, which can be easily integrated into various baselines to significantly enhance the transferability of adversarial samples for disturbing normally trained CNNs and advanced defense strategies.

> The generative autoencoders, such as the variational autoencoders or the adversarial autoencoders, have achieved great success in lots of real-world applications, including image generation, and signal communication.   However, little concern has been devoted to their robustness during practical deployment.   Due to the probabilistic latent structure, variational autoencoders (VAEs) may confront problems such as a mismatch between the posterior distribution of the latent and real data manifold, or discontinuity in the posterior distribution of the latent.   This leaves a back door for malicious attackers to collapse VAEs from the latent space, especially in scenarios where the encoder and decoder are used separately, such as communication and compressed sensing.   In this work, we provide the first study on the adversarial robustness of generative autoencoders in the latent space.   Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the latent vulnerability of popular generative autoencoders through attacks in the latent space.   We also evaluate the difference between variational autoencoders and their deterministic variants and observe that the latter performs better in latent robustness.   Meanwhile, we identify a potential trade-off between the adversarial robustness and the degree of the disentanglement of the latent codes.   Additionally, we also verify the feasibility of improvement for the latent robustness of VAEs through adversarial training.   In summary, we suggest concerning the adversarial latent robustness of the generative autoencoders, analyze several robustness-relative issues, and give some insights into a series of key challenges.

> Fuzzing has emerged as a powerful technique for finding security bugs in complicated real-world applications. American fuzzy lop (AFL), a leading fuzzing tool, has demonstrated its powerful bug finding ability through a vast number of reported CVEs. However, its random mutation strategy is unable to generate test inputs that satisfy complicated branching conditions (e.g., magic-byte comparisons, checksum tests, and nested if-statements), which are commonly used in image decoders/encoders, XML parsers, and checksum tools. Existing approaches (such as Steelix and Neuzz) on addressing this problem assume unrealistic assumptions such as we can satisfy the branch condition byte-to-byte or we can identify and focus on the important bytes in the input (called hot-bytes) once and for all. In this work, we propose an approach called \tool~which is designed based on the following principles. First, there is a complicated relation between inputs and branching conditions and thus we need not only an expressive model to capture such relationship but also an informative measure so that we can learn such relationship effectively. Second, different branching conditions demand different hot-bytes and we must adjust our fuzzing strategy adaptively depending on which branches are the current bottleneck. We implement our approach as an open source project and compare its efficiency with other state-of-the-art fuzzers. Our evaluation results on 10 real-world programs and LAVA-M dataset show that \tool~achieves sustained increases in branch coverage and discovers more bugs than other fuzzers.

> In Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), security vulnerabilities are one of the points introduced during the construction stage. Failure to detect software defects earlier after releasing the product to the market causes higher repair costs for the company. So, it decreases the company's reputation, violates user privacy, and causes an unrepairable issue for the application. The introduction of vulnerability detection enables reducing the number of false alerts to focus the limited testing efforts on potentially vulnerable files. UMKM Masa Kini (UMI) is a Point of Sales application to sell any Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Product (UMKM). Therefore, in the current work, we analyze the suitability of these metrics to create Machine Learning based software vulnerability detectors for UMI applications. Code is generated using a commercial tool, SonarCloud. Experimental result shows that there are 3,285 vulnerable rules detected.

> Large language models trained for safety and harmlessness remain susceptible to adversarial misuse, as evidenced by the prevalence of "jailbreak" attacks on early releases of ChatGPT that elicit undesired behavior. Going beyond recognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how they can be created. We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competing objectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives arise when a model's capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalization occurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design and then evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks. We find that vulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-training efforts behind these models. Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modes succeed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models' red-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks. Our analysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity -- that safety mechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model -- and argues against the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes.

> The various benefits of multi-tenanting, such as higher device utilization and increased profit margin, intrigue the cloud field-programmable gate array (FPGA) servers to include multi-tenanting in their infrastructure. However, this property makes these servers vulnerable to power side-channel (PSC) attacks. Logic designs such as ring oscillator (RO) and time-to-digital converter (TDC) are used to measure the power consumed by security critical circuits, such as advanced encryption standard (AES). Firstly, the existing works require higher minimum traces for disclosure (MTD). Hence, in this work, we improve the sensitivity of the TDC-based sensors by manually placing the FPGA primitives inferring these sensors. This enhancement helps to determine the 128-bit AES key using 3.8K traces. Secondly, the existing defenses use ROs to defend against PSC attacks. However, cloud servers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) block design with combinatorial loops. Hence, we propose a placement-based defense. We study the impact of (i) primitive-level placement on the AES design and (ii) additional logic that resides along with the AES on the correlation power analysis (CPA) attack results. Our results showcase that the AES along with filters and/or processors are sufficient to provide the same level or better security than the existing defenses.

The testbed contains nodes with known security vulnerabilities which can be exploited by hackers. Participants can be invited to play the role of a hacker (e.g., black-hat, hacktivist) and attack the testbed. The testbed is designed such that there are multiple attack pathways available to hackers. We describe the working of the testbed components and discuss its implementation on a VMware ESXi server. Finally, we subject our testbed implementation to a few well-known cyber-attack strategies, collect data during the process and present our analysis of the data.

> Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to the benign input. After achieving nearly 100% attack success rates in white-box setting, more focus is shifted to black-box attacks, of which the transferability of adversarial examples has gained significant attention. In either case, the common gradient-based methods generally use the sign function to generate perturbations on the gradient update, that offers a roughly correct direction and has gained great success. But little work pays attention to its possible limitation. In this work, we observe that the deviation between the original gradient and the generated noise may lead to inaccurate gradient update estimation and suboptimal solutions for adversarial transferability. To this end, we propose a Sampling-based Fast Gradient Rescaling Method (S-FGRM). Specifically, we use data rescaling to substitute the sign function without extra computational cost. We further propose a Depth First Sampling method to eliminate the fluctuation of rescaling and stabilize the gradient update. Our method could be used in any gradient-based attacks and is extensible to be integrated with various input transformation or ensemble methods to further improve the adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset show that our method could significantly boost the transferability of gradient-based attacks and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown superior performance comparing to traditional image denoising algorithms. However, DNNs are inevitably vulnerable while facing adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an adversarial attack method named denoising-PGD which can successfully attack all the current deep denoising models while keep the noise distribution almost unchanged. We surprisingly find that the current mainstream non-blind denoising models (DnCNN, FFDNet, ECNDNet, BRDNet), blind denoising models (DnCNN-B, Noise2Noise, RDDCNN-B, FAN), plug-and-play (DPIR, CurvPnP) and unfolding denoising models (DeamNet) almost share the same adversarial sample set on both grayscale and color images, respectively. Shared adversarial sample set indicates that all these models are similar in term of local behaviors at the neighborhood of all the test samples. Thus, we further propose an indicator to measure the local similarity of models, called robustness similitude. Non-blind denoising models are found to have high robustness similitude across each other, while hybrid-driven models are also found to have high robustness similitude with pure data-driven non-blind denoising models. According to our robustness assessment, data-driven non-blind denoising models are the most robust. We use adversarial training to complement the vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Moreover, the model-driven image denoising BM3D shows resistance on adversarial attacks.

> While federated learning (FL) promises to preserve privacy, recent works in the image and text domains have shown that training updates leak private client data. However, most high-stakes applications of FL (e.g., in healthcare and finance) use tabular data, where the risk of data leakage has not yet been explored. A successful attack for tabular data must address two key challenges unique to the domain: (i) obtaining a solution to a high-variance mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, and (ii) enabling human assessment of the reconstruction as unlike for image and text data, direct human inspection is not possible. In this work we address these challenges and propose TabLeak, the first comprehensive reconstruction attack on tabular data. TabLeak is based on two key contributions: (i) a method which leverages a softmax relaxation and pooled ensembling to solve the optimization problem, and (ii) an entropy-based uncertainty quantification scheme to enable human assessment. We evaluate TabLeak on four tabular datasets for both FedSGD and FedAvg training protocols, and show that it successfully breaks several settings previously deemed safe. For instance, we extract large subsets of private data at >90% accuracy even at the large batch size of 128. Our findings demonstrate that current high-stakes tabular FL is excessively vulnerable to leakage attacks.

> Differential Privacy (DP) relies on random numbers to preserve privacy, typically utilising Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs) as a source of randomness. In order to allow for consistent reproducibility, testing and bug-fixing in DP algorithms and results, it is important to allow for the seeding of the PRNGs used therein. In this work, we examine the landscape of Random Number Generators (RNGs), and the considerations software engineers should make when choosing and seeding a PRNG for DP. We hope it serves as a suitable guide for DP practitioners, and includes many lessons learned when implementing seeding for diffprivlib.

> With the increasing use of multi-cloud environments, security professionals face challenges in configuration, management, and integration due to uneven security capabilities and features among providers. As a result, a fragmented approach toward security has been observed, leading to new attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities. Other research has focused on single-cloud platforms or specific applications of multi-cloud environments. Therefore, there is a need for a holistic security and vulnerability assessment and defense strategy that applies to multi-cloud platforms. We perform a risk and vulnerability analysis to identify attack vectors from software, hardware, and the network, as well as interoperability security issues in multi-cloud environments. Applying the STRIDE and DREAD threat modeling methods, we present an analysis of the ecosystem across six attack vectors: cloud architecture, APIs, authentication, automation, management differences, and cybersecurity legislation. We quantitatively determine and rank the threats in multi-cloud environments and suggest mitigation strategies.

> In recent decades, due to the emerging requirements of computation acceleration, cloud FPGAs have become popular in public clouds. Major cloud service providers, e.g. AWS and Microsoft Azure have provided FPGA computing resources in their infrastructure and have enabled users to design and deploy their own accelerators on these FPGAs. Multi-tenancy FPGAs, where multiple users can share the same FPGA fabric with certain types of isolation to improve resource efficiency, have already been proved feasible. However, this also raises security concerns. Various types of side-channel attacks targeting multi-tenancy FPGAs have been proposed and validated. The awareness of security vulnerabilities in the cloud has motivated cloud providers to take action to enhance the security of their cloud environments.   In FPGA security research papers, researchers always perform attacks under the assumption that attackers successfully co-locate with victims and are aware of the existence of victims on the same FPGA board. However, the way to reach this point, i.e., how attackers secretly obtain information regarding accelerators on the same fabric, is constantly ignored despite the fact that it is non-trivial and important for attackers. In this paper, we present a novel fingerprinting attack to gain the types of co-located FPGA accelerators. We utilize a seemingly non-malicious benchmark accelerator to sniff the communication link and collect performance traces of the FPGA-host communication link. By analyzing these traces, we are able to achieve high classification accuracy for fingerprinting co-located accelerators, which proves that attackers can use our method to perform cloud FPGA accelerator fingerprinting with a high success rate. As far as we know, this is the first paper targeting multi-tenant FPGA accelerator fingerprinting with the communication side-channel.

> Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) play an important role to ensure the security and confidentiality of image cryptographic algorithms. Their primary function is to generate a sequence of numbers that possesses unpredictability and randomness, which is crucial for the algorithms to work effectively and provide the desired level of security. However, traditional PRNGs frequently encounter limitations like insufficient randomness, predictability, and vulnerability to cryptanalysis attacks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method namely an elliptic curve genetic algorithm (ECGA) for the construction of an image-dependent pseudo-random number generator (IDPRNG) that merges elliptic curves (ECs) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The ECGA consists of two primary stages. First, we generate an EC-based initial sequence of random numbers using pixels of a plain-image and parameters of an EC, that depart from traditional methods of population initialization. In our proposed approach, the image itself serves as the seed for the initial population in the genetic algorithm optimization, taking into account the image-dependent nature of cryptographic applications. This allows the PRNG to adapt its behavior to the unique characteristics of the input image, leading to enhanced security and improved resistance against differential attacks. Furthermore, the use of a good initial population reduces the number of generations required by a genetic algorithm, which results in decreased computational cost. In the second stage, we use well-known operations of a genetic algorithm to optimize the generated sequence by maximizing a multi-objective fitness function that is based on both the information entropy and the period of the PRNG. By combining elliptic curves and genetic algorithms, we enhance the randomness and security of the ECGA.

> Passive optical network (PON) systems are vulnerable to a variety of failures, including fiber cuts and optical network unit (ONU) transmitter/receiver failures. Any service interruption caused by a fiber cut can result in huge financial losses for service providers or operators. Identifying the faulty ONU becomes difficult in the case of nearly equidistant branch terminations because the reflections from the branches overlap, making it difficult to distinguish the faulty branch given the global backscattering signal. With increasing network size, the complexity of fault monitoring in PON systems increases, resulting in less reliable monitoring. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper various machine learning (ML) approaches for fault monitoring in PON systems, and we validate them using experimental optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) data.

> Software bug reports reported on bug-tracking systems often lack crucial information for the developers to promptly resolve them, costing companies billions of dollars. There has been significant research on effectively eliciting information from bug reporters in bug tracking systems using different templates that bug reporters need to use. However, the need for asking follow-up questions persists. Recent studies propose techniques to suggest these follow-up questions to help developers obtain the missing details, but there has been little research on answering these follow up questions, which are often unanswered. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses CodeT5 in combination with Lucene, an information retrieval technique that leverages the relevance of different bug reports, their components, and follow-up questions to recommend answers. These top-performing answers, along with their bug report, serve as additional context apart from the deficient bug report to the deep learning model for generating an answer. We evaluate our recommended answers with the manually annotated answers using similarity metrics like Normalized Smooth BLEU Score, METEOR, Word Mover's Distance, and Semantic Similarity. We achieve a BLEU Score of up to 34 and Semantic Similarity of up to 64 which shows that the answers generated are understandable and good according to Google's standard and can outperform multiple baselines.

> Code review is considered a key process in the software industry for minimizing bugs and improving code quality. Inspection of review process effectiveness and continuous improvement can boost development productivity. Such inspection is a time-consuming and human-bias-prone task. We propose a semi-supervised learning based system ReviewRanker which is aimed at assigning each code review a confidence score which is expected to resonate with the quality of the review. Our proposed method is trained based on simple and and well defined labels provided by developers. The labeling task requires little to no effort from the developers and has an indirect relation to the end goal (assignment of review confidence score). ReviewRanker is expected to improve industry-wide code review quality inspection through reducing human bias and effort required for such task.

> The automated code evaluation system (AES) is mainly designed to reliably assess user-submitted code. Due to their extensive range of applications and the accumulation of valuable resources, AESs are becoming increasingly popular. Research on the application of AES and their real-world resource exploration for diverse coding tasks is still lacking. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive survey on AESs and their resources. This survey explores the application areas of AESs, available resources, and resource utilization for coding tasks. AESs are categorized into programming contests, programming learning and education, recruitment, online compilers, and additional modules, depending on their application. We explore the available datasets and other resources of these systems for research, analysis, and coding tasks. Moreover, we provide an overview of machine learning-driven coding tasks, such as bug detection, code review, comprehension, refactoring, search, representation, and repair. These tasks are performed using real-life datasets. In addition, we briefly discuss the Aizu Online Judge platform as a real example of an AES from the perspectives of system design (hardware and software), operation (competition and education), and research. This is due to the scalability of the AOJ platform (programming education, competitions, and practice), open internal features (hardware and software), attention from the research community, open source data (e.g., solution codes and submission documents), and transparency. We also analyze the overall performance of this system and the perceived challenges over the years.

> Robust explanations of machine learning models are critical to establish human trust in the models. Due to limited cognition capability, most humans can only interpret the top few salient features. It is critical to make top salient features robust to adversarial attacks, especially those against the more vulnerable gradient-based explanations. Existing defense measures robustness using $\ell_p$-norms, which have weaker protection power. We define explanation thickness for measuring salient features ranking stability, and derive tractable surrogate bounds of the thickness to design the \textit{R2ET} algorithm to efficiently maximize the thickness and anchor top salient features. Theoretically, we prove a connection between R2ET and adversarial training. Experiments with a wide spectrum of network architectures and data modalities, including brain networks, demonstrate that R2ET attains higher explanation robustness under stealthy attacks while retaining accuracy.

> The local explanation provides heatmaps on images to explain how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) derive their output. Due to its visual straightforwardness, the method has been one of the most popular explainable AI (XAI) methods for diagnosing CNNs. Through our formative study (S1), however, we captured ML engineers' ambivalent perspective about the local explanation as a valuable and indispensable envision in building CNNs versus the process that exhausts them due to the heuristic nature of detecting vulnerability. Moreover, steering the CNNs based on the vulnerability learned from the diagnosis seemed highly challenging. To mitigate the gap, we designed DeepFuse, the first interactive design that realizes the direct feedback loop between a user and CNNs in diagnosing and revising CNN's vulnerability using local explanations. DeepFuse helps CNN engineers to systemically search "unreasonable" local explanations and annotate the new boundaries for those identified as unreasonable in a labor-efficient manner. Next, it steers the model based on the given annotation such that the model doesn't introduce similar mistakes. We conducted a two-day study (S2) with 12 experienced CNN engineers. Using DeepFuse, participants made a more accurate and "reasonable" model than the current state-of-the-art. Also, participants found the way DeepFuse guides case-based reasoning can practically improve their current practice. We provide implications for design that explain how future HCI-driven design can move our practice forward to make XAI-driven insights more actionable.

> Automatic detection of software bugs is a critical task in software security. Many static tools that can help detect bugs have been proposed. While these static bug detectors are mainly evaluated on general software projects call into question their practical effectiveness and usefulness for machine learning libraries. In this paper, we address this question by analyzing five popular and widely used static bug detectors, i.e., Flawfinder, RATS, Cppcheck, Facebook Infer, and Clang static analyzer on a curated dataset of software bugs gathered from four popular machine learning libraries including Mlpack, MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow with a total of 410 known bugs. Our research provides a categorization of these tools' capabilities to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the tools for detecting software bugs in machine learning libraries. Overall, our study shows that static bug detectors find a negligible amount of all bugs accounting for 6/410 bugs (0.01%), Flawfinder and RATS are the most effective static checker for finding software bugs in machine learning libraries. Based on our observations, we further identify and discuss opportunities to make the tools more effective and practical.

> Current vehicular Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems either incur high false-positive rates or do not capture zero-day vulnerabilities, leading to safety-critical risks. In addition, prevention is limited to few primitive options like dropping network packets or extreme options, e.g., ECU Bus-off state. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of vehicular Intrusion Resilience Systems (IRS) that ensures the resilience of critical applications despite assumed faults or zero-day attacks, as long as threat assumptions are met. IRS enables running a vehicular application in a replicated way, i.e., as a Replicated State Machine, over several ECUs, and then requiring the replicated processes to reach a form of Byzantine agreement before changing their local state. Our study rides the mutation of modern vehicular environments, which are closing the gap between simple and resource-constrained "real-time and embedded systems", and complex and powerful "information technology" ones. It shows that current vehicle (e.g., Zonal) architectures and networks are becoming plausible for such modular fault and intrusion tolerance solutions,deemed too heavy in the past. Our evaluation on a simulated Automotive Ethernet network running two state-of-the-art agreement protocols (Damysus and Hotstuff) shows that the achieved latency and throughout are feasible for many Automotive applications.

- `2307.05605v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05605v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05605v1)

> Secure by Design has become the mainstream development approach ensuring that software systems are not vulnerable to cyberattacks. Architectural security controls need to be carefully monitored over the software development life cycle to avoid critical design flaws. Unfortunately, functional requirements usually get in the way of the security features, and the development team may not correctly address critical security requirements. Identifying tactic-related code pieces in a software project enables an efficient review of the security controls' implementation as well as a resilient software architecture. This paper enumerates a comprehensive list of commonly used security controls and creates a dataset for each one of them by pulling related and unrelated code snippets from the open API of the StackOverflow question and answer platform. It uses the state-of-the-art NLP technique Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and the Tactic Detector from our prior work to show that code pieces that implement security controls could be identified with high confidence. The results show that our model trained on tactic-related and unrelated code snippets derived from StackOverflow is able to identify tactic-related code pieces with F-Measure values above 0.9.

- `2307.05006v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05006v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05006v1)

> RNN-Transducers (RNN-Ts) have gained widespread acceptance as an end-to-end model for speech to text conversion because of their high accuracy and streaming capabilities. A typical RNN-T independently encodes the input audio and the text context, and combines the two encodings by a thin joint network. While this architecture provides SOTA streaming accuracy, it also makes the model vulnerable to strong LM biasing which manifests as multi-step hallucination of text without acoustic evidence. In this paper we propose LookAhead that makes text representations more acoustically grounded by looking ahead into the future within the audio input. This technique yields a significant 5%-20% relative reduction in word error rate on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation sets.

> Deep learning technology has made great achievements in the field of image. In order to defend against malware attacks, researchers have proposed many Windows malware detection models based on deep learning. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. Malware can generate adversarial malware with the same malicious function to attack the malware detection model and evade detection of the model. Currently, many adversarial defense studies have been proposed, but existing adversarial defense studies are based on image sample and cannot be directly applied to malware sample. Therefore, this paper proposes an adversarial malware defense method based on adversarial training. This method uses preprocessing to defend simple adversarial examples to reduce the difficulty of adversarial training. Moreover, this method improves the adversarial defense capability of the model through adversarial training. We experimented with three attack methods in two sets of datasets, and the results show that the method in this paper can improve the adversarial defense capability of the model without reducing the accuracy of the model.

> As machine learning gains prominence in various sectors of society for automated decision-making, concerns have risen regarding potential vulnerabilities in machine learning (ML) frameworks. Nevertheless, testing these frameworks is a daunting task due to their intricate implementation. Previous research on fuzzing ML frameworks has struggled to effectively extract input constraints and generate valid inputs, leading to extended fuzzing durations for deep execution or revealing the target crash.   In this paper, we propose ConFL, a constraint-guided fuzzer for ML frameworks. ConFL automatically extracting constraints from kernel codes without the need for any prior knowledge. Guided by the constraints, ConFL is able to generate valid inputs that can pass the verification and explore deeper paths of kernel codes. In addition, we design a grouping technique to boost the fuzzing efficiency.   To demonstrate the effectiveness of ConFL, we evaluated its performance mainly on Tensorflow. We find that ConFL is able to cover more code lines, and generate more valid inputs than state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers. More importantly, ConFL found 84 previously unknown vulnerabilities in different versions of Tensorflow, all of which were assigned with new CVE ids, of which 3 were critical-severity and 13 were high-severity. We also extended ConFL to test PyTorch and Paddle, 7 vulnerabilities are found to date.

> Many small to large organizations have adopted the Microservices Architecture (MSA) style to develop and deliver their core businesses. Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study inform that Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we formulated future research directions that could help researchers and practitioners to engineer emergent and next-generation microservices systems.

- *Jingda Yang, Ying Wang*

- `2307.05758v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05758v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05758v1)

> Softwarization and virtualization in 5G and beyond require rigorous testing against vulnerabilities and unintended emergent behaviors for critical infrastructure and network security assurance. Formal methods operates efficiently in protocol-level abstract specification models, and fuzz testing offers comprehensive experimental evaluation of system implementations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the respective advantages and coverage of both formal and fuzzing methods to efficiently detect vulnerabilities from protocol logic to implementation stacks hierarchically. The detected attack traces from the formal verification results in critical protocols guide the case generation of fuzz testing, and the feedbacks from fuzz testing further broaden the scope of the formal verification. We examine the proposed framework with the 5G Non Standard-Alone (NSA) security processes, focusing on the Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection process. We first identify protocol-level vulnerabilities of user credentials via formal methods. Following this, we implement bit-level fuzzing to evaluate potential impacts and risks of integrity-vulnerable identifier variation. Concurrently, we conduct command-level mutation-based fuzzing by fixing the assumption identifier to assess the potential impacts and risks of confidentiality-vulnerable identifiers. During this approach, we established 1 attack model and detected 53 vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities identified used to fortify protocol-level assumptions could further refine search space for the following detection cycles. Consequently, it addresses the prevalent scalability challenges in detecting vulnerabilities and unintended emergent behaviors in large-scale systems in 5G and beyond.

> Recently it has been shown that state-of-the-art NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where the predictions of a model can be drastically altered by slight modifications to the input (such as synonym substitutions). While several defense techniques have been proposed, and adapted, to the discrete nature of text adversarial attacks, the benefits of general-purpose regularization methods such as label smoothing for language models, have not been studied. In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness provided by various label smoothing strategies in foundational models for diverse NLP tasks in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our experiments show that label smoothing significantly improves adversarial robustness in pre-trained models like BERT, against various popular attacks. We also analyze the relationship between prediction confidence and robustness, showing that label smoothing reduces over-confident errors on adversarial examples.

- *Rubens Copche, Yohan Duarte Pessanha, Vinicius Durelli, Marcelo Medeiros Eler, Andre Takeshi Endo*

- `2307.05807v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05807v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05807v1)

> Tests executed by human testers are still widespread in practice and fill the gap left by limitations of automated approaches. Among the human-centered approaches, exploratory testing is the de facto approach in agile teams. Although it is focused on the expertise and creativity of the tester, the activity of exploratory testing may benefit from support provided by an automated agent that interacts with the human testers. This paper presents a chatbot, called BotExpTest, designed to support testers while performing exploratory tests of software applications. We implemented BotExpTest on top of the instant messaging social platform Discord; this version includes functionalities to report bugs and issues, time management of test sessions, guidelines for app testing, and presentation of exploratory testing strategies. To assess BotExpTest, we conducted a user study with six software engineering professionals. They carried out two sessions performing exploratory tests along with BotExpTest. Participants were capable of revealing bugs and found the experience to interact with the chatbot positive. Preliminary analyses indicate that chatbot-enabled exploratory testing may be as effective as similar approaches and help testers to uncover different bugs. Bots are shown to be valuable resources for Software Engineering, and initiatives like BotExpTest may help to improve the effectiveness of testing activities like exploratory testing.

> Modern System-on-Chip designs typically use Network-on-Chip (NoC) fabrics to implement coordination among integrated hardware blocks. An important class of security vulnerabilities involves a rogue foundry reverse-engineering the NoC topology and routing logic. In this paper, we develop an infrastructure, $\obnocs$, for protecting NoC fabrics against such attacks. $\obnocs$ systematically replaces router connections with switches that can be programmed after fabrication to induce the desired topology. Our approach provides provable redaction of NoC functionality: switch configurations induce a large number of legal topologies, only one of which corresponds to the intended topology. We implement the $\obnocs$ methodology on Intel Quartus\texttrademark\ Platform, and experimental results on realistic SoC designs show that the architecture incurs minimal overhead in power, resource utilization, and system latency.

> Today, we rely on contactless smart cards to perform several critical operations (e.g., payments and accessing buildings). Attacking smart cards can have severe consequences, such as losing money or leaking sensitive information. Although the security protections embedded in smart cards have evolved over the years, those with weak security properties are still commonly used. Among the different solutions, blocking cards are affordable devices to protect smart cards. These devices are placed close to the smart cards, generating a noisy jamming signal or shielding them. Whereas vendors claim the reliability of their blocking cards, no previous study has ever focused on evaluating their effectiveness. In this paper, we shed light on the security threats on smart cards in the presence of blocking cards, showing the possibility of being bypassed by an attacker. We analyze blocking cards by inspecting their emitted signal and assessing a vulnerability in their internal design. We propose a novel attack that bypasses the jamming signal emitted by a blocking card and reads the content of the smart card. We evaluate the effectiveness of 11 blocking cards when protecting a MIFARE Ultralight smart card and a MIFARE Classic card. Of these 11 cards, we managed to bypass 8 of them and successfully dump the content of a smart card despite the presence of the blocking card. Our findings highlight that the noise type implemented by the blocking cards highly affects the protection level achieved by them. Based on this observation, we propose a countermeasure that may lead to the design of effective blocking cards. To further improve security, we released the tool we developed to inspect the spectrum emitted by blocking cards and set up our attack.

> Software testing is a mandatory activity in any serious software development process, as bugs are a reality in software development. This raises the question of quality: good tests are effective in finding bugs, but until a test case actually finds a bug, its effectiveness remains unknown. Therefore, determining what constitutes a good or bad test is necessary. This is not a simple task, and there are a number of studies that identify different characteristics of a good test case. A previous study evaluated 29 hypotheses regarding what constitutes a good test case, but the findings are based on developers' beliefs, which are subjective and biased. In this paper we investigate eight of these hypotheses, through an extensive empirical study based on open software repositories. Despite our best efforts, we were unable to find evidence that supports these beliefs. This indicates that, although these hypotheses represent good software engineering advice, they do not necessarily mean that they are enough to provide the desired outcome of good testing code.

- `2307.06496v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06496v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06496v1)

> Deep learning models are susceptible to adversarial samples in white and black-box environments. Although previous studies have shown high attack success rates, coupling DNN models with interpretation models could offer a sense of security when a human expert is involved, who can identify whether a given sample is benign or malicious. However, in white-box environments, interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes) have been shown to be vulnerable to malicious manipulations. In black-box settings, as access to the components of IDLSes is limited, it becomes more challenging for the adversary to fool the system. In this work, we propose a Query-efficient Score-based black-box attack against IDLSes, QuScore, which requires no knowledge of the target model and its coupled interpretation model. QuScore is based on transfer-based and score-based methods by employing an effective microbial genetic algorithm. Our method is designed to reduce the number of queries necessary to carry out successful attacks, resulting in a more efficient process. By continuously refining the adversarial samples created based on feedback scores from the IDLS, our approach effectively navigates the search space to identify perturbations that can fool the system. We evaluate the attack's effectiveness on four CNN models (Inception, ResNet, VGG, DenseNet) and two interpretation models (CAM, Grad), using both ImageNet and CIFAR datasets. Our results show that the proposed approach is query-efficient with a high attack success rate that can reach between 95% and 100% and transferability with an average success rate of 69% in the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets. Our attack method generates adversarial examples with attribution maps that resemble benign samples. We have also demonstrated that our attack is resilient against various preprocessing defense techniques and can easily be transferred to different DNN models.

Our adversaries do not win by playing Go well. Instead, they trick KataGo into making serious blunders. Our attack transfers zero-shot to other superhuman Go-playing AIs, and is comprehensible to the extent that human experts can implement it without algorithmic assistance to consistently beat superhuman AIs. The core vulnerability uncovered by our attack persists even in KataGo agents adversarially trained to defend against our attack.

> A previously unknown form of compromising emanations has been discovered. LED status indicators on data communication equipment, under certain conditions, are shown to carry a modulated optical signal that is significantly correlated with information being processed by the device. Physical access is not required; the attacker gains access to all data going through the device, including plaintext in the case of data encryption systems. Experiments show that it is possible to intercept data under realistic conditions at a considerable distance. Many different sorts of devices, including modems and Internet Protocol routers, were found to be vulnerable. A taxonomy of compromising optical emanations is developed, and design changes are described that will successfully block this kind of "Optical TEMPEST" attack.

> Popular and large contemporary open-source projects now embrace a diverse set of documentation for communication channels. Examples include contribution guidelines (i.e., commit message guidelines, coding rules, submission guidelines), code of conduct (i.e., rules and behavior expectations), governance policies, and Q&A forum. In 2020, GitHub released Discussion to distinguish between communication and collaboration. However, it remains unclear how developers maintain these channels, how trivial it is, and whether deciding on conversion takes time. We conducted an empirical study on 259 NPM and 148 PyPI repositories, devising two taxonomies of reasons for converting discussions into issues and vice-versa. The most frequent conversion from a discussion to an issue is when developers request a contributor to clarify their idea into an issue (Reporting a Clarification Request -35.1% and 34.7%, respectively), while agreeing that having non actionable topic (QA, ideas, feature requests -55.0% and 42.0%, respectively}) is the most frequent reason of converting an issue into a discussion. Furthermore, we show that not all reasons for conversion are trivial (e.g., not a bug), and raising a conversion intent potentially takes time (i.e., a median of 15.2 and 35.1 hours, respectively, taken from issues to discussions). Our work contributes to complementing the GitHub guidelines and helping developers effectively utilize the Issue and Discussion communication channels to maintain their collaboration.

> As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to evolve, smartphones have become essential components of IoT systems. However, with the increasing amount of personal information stored on smartphones, user privacy is at risk of being compromised by malicious attackers. Although malware detection engines are commonly installed on smartphones against these attacks, attacks that can evade these defenses may still emerge. In this paper, we analyze the return values of system calls on Android smartphones and find two never-disclosed vulnerable return values that can leak fine-grained user behaviors. Based on this observation, we present EavesDroid, an application-embedded side-channel attack on Android smartphones that allows unprivileged attackers to accurately identify fine-grained user behaviors (e.g., viewing messages and playing videos) via on-screen operations. Our attack relies on the correlation between user behaviors and the return values associated with hardware and system resources. While this attack is challenging since these return values are susceptible to fluctuation and misalignment caused by many factors, we show that attackers can eavesdrop on fine-grained user behaviors using a CNN-GRU classification model that adopts min-max normalization and multiple return value fusion. Our experiments on different models and versions of Android smartphones demonstrate that EavesDroid can achieve 98% and 86% inference accuracy for 17 classes of user behaviors in the test set and real-world settings, highlighting the risk of our attack on user privacy. Finally, we recommend effective malware detection, carefully designed obfuscation methods, or restrictions on reading vulnerable return values to mitigate this attack.

> Adversarial Training (AT) has been found to substantially improve the robustness of deep learning classifiers against adversarial attacks. AT involves obtaining robustness by including adversarial examples in training a classifier. Most variants of AT algorithms treat every training example equally. However, recent works have shown that better performance is achievable by treating them unequally. In addition, it has been observed that AT exerts an uneven influence on different classes in a training set and unfairly hurts examples corresponding to classes that are inherently harder to classify. Consequently, various reweighting schemes have been proposed that assign unequal weights to robust losses of individual examples in a training set. In this work, we propose a novel instance-wise reweighting scheme. It considers the vulnerability of each natural example and the resulting information loss on its adversarial counterpart occasioned by adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method significantly improves over existing reweighting schemes, especially against strong white and black-box attacks.

> Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in vast real-world applications, their vulnerabilities towards noisy inputs have significantly limited their uses, especially in high-stake environments. In these contexts, it is crucial to ensure that every prediction made by large language models is stable, i.e., LLM predictions should be consistent given minor differences in the input. This largely falls into the study of certified robust LLMs, i.e., all predictions of LLM are certified to be correct in a local region around the input. Randomized smoothing has demonstrated great potential in certifying the robustness and prediction stability of LLMs. However, randomized smoothing requires adding noise to the input before model prediction, and its certification performance depends largely on the model's performance on corrupted data. As a result, its direct application to LLMs remains challenging and often results in a small certification radius. To address this issue, we take advantage of the multitasking nature of LLMs and propose to denoise the corrupted inputs with LLMs in a self-denoising manner. Different from previous works like denoised smoothing, which requires training a separate model to robustify LLM, our method enjoys far better efficiency and flexibility. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms the existing certification methods under both certified robustness and empirical robustness. The codes are available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/SelfDenoise.

> Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) algorithms, commonly referred to as load disaggregation algorithms, are fundamental tools for effective energy management. Despite the success of deep models in load disaggregation, they face various challenges, particularly those pertaining to privacy and security. This paper investigates the sensitivity of prominent deep NILM baselines to adversarial attacks, which have proven to be a significant threat in domains such as computer vision and speech recognition. Adversarial attacks entail the introduction of imperceptible noise into the input data with the aim of misleading the neural network into generating erroneous outputs. We investigate the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), a well-known adversarial attack, to perturb the input sequences fed into two commonly employed CNN-based NILM baselines: the Sequence-to-Sequence (S2S) and Sequence-to-Point (S2P) models. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the vulnerability of these models, particularly the S2P model which exhibits an average decline of 20\% in the F1-score even with small amounts of noise. Such weakness has the potential to generate profound implications for energy management systems in residential and industrial sectors reliant on NILM models.

> Federated learning (FL) as distributed machine learning has gained popularity as privacy-aware Machine Learning (ML) systems have emerged as a technique that prevents privacy leakage by building a global model and by conducting individualized training of decentralized edge clients on their own private data. The existing works, however, employ privacy mechanisms such as Secure Multiparty Computing (SMC), Differential Privacy (DP), etc. Which are immensely susceptible to interference, massive computational overhead, low accuracy, etc. With the increasingly broad deployment of FL systems, it is challenging to ensure fairness and maintain active client participation in FL systems. Very few works ensure reasonably satisfactory performances for the numerous diverse clients and fail to prevent potential bias against particular demographics in FL systems. The current efforts fail to strike a compromise between privacy, fairness, and model performance in FL systems and are vulnerable to a number of additional problems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey stating the basic concepts of FL, the existing privacy challenges, techniques, and relevant works concerning privacy in FL. We also provide an extensive overview of the increasing fairness challenges, existing fairness notions, and the limited works that attempt both privacy and fairness in FL. By comprehensively describing the existing FL systems, we present the potential future directions pertaining to the challenges of privacy-preserving and fairness-aware FL systems.

> Models derived from other models are extremely common in machine learning (ML) today. For example, transfer learning is used to create task-specific models from "pre-trained" models through finetuning. This has led to an ecosystem where models are related to each other, sharing structure and often even parameter values. However, it is hard to manage these model derivatives: the storage overhead of storing all derived models quickly becomes onerous, prompting users to get rid of intermediate models that might be useful for further analysis. Additionally, undesired behaviors in models are hard to track down (e.g., is a bug inherited from an upstream model?). In this paper, we propose a model versioning and management system called MGit that makes it easier to store, test, update, and collaborate on model derivatives. MGit introduces a lineage graph that records provenance and versioning information between models, optimizations to efficiently store model parameters, as well as abstractions over this lineage graph that facilitate relevant testing, updating and collaboration functionality. MGit is able to reduce the lineage graph's storage footprint by up to 7x and automatically update downstream models in response to updates to upstream models.

> We study reward poisoning attacks on online deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where the attacker is oblivious to the learning algorithm used by the agent and the dynamics of the environment. We demonstrate the intrinsic vulnerability of state-of-the-art DRL algorithms by designing a general, black-box reward poisoning framework called adversarial MDP attacks. We instantiate our framework to construct two new attacks which only corrupt the rewards for a small fraction of the total training timesteps and make the agent learn a low-performing policy. We provide a theoretical analysis of the efficiency of our attack and perform an extensive empirical evaluation. Our results show that our attacks efficiently poison agents learning in several popular classical control and MuJoCo environments with a variety of state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, such as DQN, PPO, SAC, etc.

> Directed grey-box fuzzing (DGF) is a target-guided fuzzing intended for testing specific targets (e.g., the potential buggy code). Despite numerous techniques proposed to enhance directedness, the existing DGF techniques still face challenges, such as taking into account the difficulty of reaching different basic blocks when designing the fitness metric, and promoting the effectiveness of symbolic execution (SE) when solving the complex constraints in the path to the target. In this paper, we propose a directed hybrid fuzzer called HyperGo. To address the challenges, we introduce the concept of path probability and combine the probability with distance to form an adaptive fitness metric called probability-based distance. By combining the two factors, probability-based distance can adaptively guide DGF toward paths that are closer to the target and have more easy-to-satisfy path constraints. Then, we put forward an Optimized Symbolic Execution Complementary (OSEC) scheme to combine DGF and SE in a complementary manner. The OSEC would prune the unreachable branches and unsolvable branches, and prioritize symbolic execution of the seeds whose paths are closer to the target and have more branches that are difficult to be covered by DGF. We evaluated HyperGo on 2 benchmarks consisting of 21 programs with a total of 100 target sites. The experimental results show that HyperGo achieves 38.47$\times$, 30.89$\times$, 28.52$\times$, 106.09$\times$ and 143.22$\times$ speedup compared to AFLGo, AFLGoSy, BEACON, WindRanger, and ParmeSan, respectively in reaching target sites, and 3.44$\times$, 3.63$\times$, 4.10$\times$, 3.26$\times$, and 3.00$\times$ speedup in exposing known vulnerabilities. Moreover, HyperGo discovered 37 undisclosed vulnerabilities from 7 real-world programs.

> Deep Learning-based image synthesis techniques have been applied in healthcare research for generating medical images to support open research and augment medical datasets. Training generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) usually require large amounts of training data. Federated learning (FL) provides a way of training a central model using distributed data while keeping raw data locally. However, given that the FL server cannot access the raw data, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, an adversarial by poisoning training data. Most backdoor attack strategies focus on classification models and centralized domains. It is still an open question if the existing backdoor attacks can affect GAN training and, if so, how to defend against the attack in the FL setting. In this work, we investigate the overlooked issue of backdoor attacks in federated GANs (FedGANs). The success of this attack is subsequently determined to be the result of some local discriminators overfitting the poisoned data and corrupting the local GAN equilibrium, which then further contaminates other clients when averaging the generator's parameters and yields high generator loss. Therefore, we proposed FedDetect, an efficient and effective way of defending against the backdoor attack in the FL setting, which allows the server to detect the client's adversarial behavior based on their losses and block the malicious clients. Our extensive experiments on two medical datasets with different modalities demonstrate the backdoor attack on FedGANs can result in synthetic images with low fidelity. After detecting and suppressing the detected malicious clients using the proposed defense strategy, we show that FedGANs can synthesize high-quality medical datasets (with labels) for data augmentation to improve classification models' performance.

> Stigma toward people who use substances (PWUS) is a leading barrier to seeking treatment.Further, those in treatment are more likely to drop out if they experience higher levels of stigmatization. While related concepts of hate speech and toxicity, including those targeted toward vulnerable populations, have been the focus of automatic content moderation research, stigma and, in particular, people who use substances have not. This paper explores stigma toward PWUS using a data set of roughly 5,000 public Reddit posts. We performed a crowd-sourced annotation task where workers are asked to annotate each post for the presence of stigma toward PWUS and answer a series of questions related to their experiences with substance use. Results show that workers who use substances or know someone with a substance use disorder are more likely to rate a post as stigmatizing. Building on this, we use a supervised machine learning framework that centers workers with lived substance use experience to label each Reddit post as stigmatizing. Modeling person-level demographics in addition to comment-level language results in a classification accuracy (as measured by AUC) of 0.69 -- a 17% increase over modeling language alone. Finally, we explore the linguist cues which distinguish stigmatizing content: PWUS substances and those who don't agree that language around othering ("people", "they") and terms like "addict" are stigmatizing, while PWUS (as opposed to those who do not) find discussions around specific substances more stigmatizing. Our findings offer insights into the nature of perceived stigma in substance use. Additionally, these results further establish the subjective nature of such machine learning tasks, highlighting the need for understanding their social contexts.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely and successfully adopted and deployed in various applications of speech recognition. Recently, a few works revealed that these models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where the adversaries can implant malicious prediction behaviors into victim models by poisoning their training process. In this paper, we revisit poison-only backdoor attacks against speech recognition. We reveal that existing methods are not stealthy since their trigger patterns are perceptible to humans or machine detection. This limitation is mostly because their trigger patterns are simple noises or separable and distinctive clips. Motivated by these findings, we propose to exploit elements of sound ($e.g.$, pitch and timbre) to design more stealthy yet effective poison-only backdoor attacks. Specifically, we insert a short-duration high-pitched signal as the trigger and increase the pitch of remaining audio clips to `mask' it for designing stealthy pitch-based triggers. We manipulate timbre features of victim audios to design the stealthy timbre-based attack and design a voiceprint selection module to facilitate the multi-backdoor attack. Our attacks can generate more `natural' poisoned samples and therefore are more stealthy. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of our attacks under different settings ($e.g.$, all-to-one, all-to-all, clean-label, physical, and multi-backdoor settings) and their stealthiness. The code for reproducing main experiments are available at \url{https://github.com/HanboCai/BadSpeech_SoE}.

> Multimodal contrastive pretraining has been used to train multimodal representation models, such as CLIP, on large amounts of paired image-text data. However, previous studies have revealed that such models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, when trained on backdoored examples, CLIP learns spurious correlations between the embedded backdoor trigger and the target label, aligning their representations in the joint embedding space. Injecting even a small number of poisoned examples, such as 75 examples in 3 million pretraining data, can significantly manipulate the model's behavior, making it difficult to detect or unlearn such correlations. To address this issue, we propose CleanCLIP, a finetuning framework that weakens the learned spurious associations introduced by backdoor attacks by independently re-aligning the representations for individual modalities. We demonstrate that unsupervised finetuning using a combination of multimodal contrastive and unimodal self-supervised objectives for individual modalities can significantly reduce the impact of the backdoor attack. Additionally, we show that supervised finetuning on task-specific labeled image data removes the backdoor trigger from the CLIP vision encoder. We show empirically that CleanCLIP maintains model performance on benign examples while erasing a range of backdoor attacks on multimodal contrastive learning. The code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/CleanCLIP.

However, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Several previous works have demonstrated the feasibility of adversarial attacks on traffic sign recognition models. Traffic signs are particularly promising for adversarial attack research due to the ease of performing real-world attacks using printed signs or stickers. In this work, we survey existing works performing either digital or real-world attacks on traffic sign detection and classification models. We provide an overview of the latest advancements and highlight the existing research areas that require further investigation.

Adversarial attacks can have serious consequences, particularly in applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and security systems. Work on the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks has shown that it is very easy to make samples that make a model predict things that it doesn't want to. In this work, we analyze the impact of model interpretability due to adversarial attacks on text classification problems. We develop an ML-based classification model for text data. Then, we introduce the adversarial perturbations on the text data to understand the classification performance after the attack. Subsequently, we analyze and interpret the model's explainability before and after the attack

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, which will generate a poisoned graph as the input to the GNN models. We present FocusedCleaner as a poisoned graph sanitizer to effectively identify the poison injected by attackers. Specifically, FocusedCleaner provides a sanitation framework consisting of two modules: bi-level structural learning and victim node detection. In particular, the structural learning module will reverse the attack process to steadily sanitize the graph while the detection module provides ``the focus" -- a narrowed and more accurate search region -- to structural learning. These two modules will operate in iterations and reinforce each other to sanitize a poisoned graph step by step. As an important application, we show that the adversarial robustness of GNNs trained over the sanitized graph for the node classification task is significantly improved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FocusedCleaner outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines both on poisoned graph sanitation and improving robustness.

> The success of graph neural networks stimulates the prosperity of graph mining and the corresponding downstream tasks including graph anomaly detection (GAD). However, it has been explored that those graph mining methods are vulnerable to structural manipulations on relational data. That is, the attacker can maliciously perturb the graph structures to assist the target nodes to evade anomaly detection. In this paper, we explore the structural vulnerability of two typical GAD systems: unsupervised FeXtra-based GAD and supervised GCN-based GAD. Specifically, structural poisoning attacks against GAD are formulated as complex bi-level optimization problems. Our first major contribution is then to transform the bi-level problem into one-level leveraging different regression methods. Furthermore, we propose a new way of utilizing gradient information to optimize the one-level optimization problem in the discrete domain. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack algorithm BinarizedAttack.

> In order to monitor and prevent bias in AI systems we can use a wide range of (statistical) fairness measures. However, it is mathematically impossible to optimize for all of these measures at the same time. In addition, optimizing a fairness measure often greatly reduces the accuracy of the system (Kozodoi et al, 2022). As a result, we need a substantive theory that informs us how to make these decisions and for what reasons. I show that by using Rawls' notion of justice as fairness, we can create a basis for navigating fairness measures and the accuracy trade-off. In particular, this leads to a principled choice focusing on both the most vulnerable groups and the type of fairness measure that has the biggest impact on that group. This also helps to close part of the gap between philosophical accounts of distributive justice and the fairness literature that has been observed (Kuppler et al, 2021) and to operationalise the value of fairness.

> Due to the immutable and decentralized nature of Ethereum (ETH) platform, smart contracts are prone to security risks that can result in financial loss. While existing machine learning-based vulnerability detection algorithms achieve high accuracy at the contract level, they require developers to manually inspect source code to locate bugs. To this end, we present G-Scan, the first end-to-end fine-grained line-level vulnerability detection system evaluated on the first-of-its-kind real world dataset. G-Scan first converts smart contracts to code graphs in a dependency and hierarchy preserving manner. Next, we train a graph neural network to identify vulnerable nodes and assess security risks. Finally, the code graphs with node vulnerability predictions are mapped back to the smart contracts for line-level localization. We train and evaluate G-Scan on a collected real world smart contracts dataset with line-level annotations on reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most common and severe types of smart contract vulnerabilities. With the well-designed graph representation and high-quality dataset, G-Scan achieves 93.02% F1-score in contract-level vulnerability detection and 93.69% F1-score in line-level vulnerability localization. Additionally, the lightweight graph neural network enables G-Scan to localize vulnerabilities in 6.1k lines of code smart contract within 1.2 seconds.

> Bug localization techniques for Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers are based on analyzing the execution behaviors of the target JIT compiler on a set of test programs generated for this purpose; characteristics of these test inputs can significantly impact the accuracy of bug localization. However, current approaches for automatic test program generation do not work well for bug localization in JIT compilers. This paper proposes a novel technique for automatic test program generation for JIT compiler bug localization that is based on two key insights: (1) the generated test programs should contain both passing inputs (which do not trigger the bug) and failing inputs (which trigger the bug); and (2) the passing inputs should be as similar as possible to the initial seed input, while the failing programs should be as different as possible from it. We use a structural analysis of the seed program to determine which parts of the code should be mutated for each of the passing and failing cases. Experiments using a prototype implementation indicate that test inputs generated using our approach result in significantly improved bug localization results than existing approaches.

> Split learning enables collaborative deep learning model training while preserving data privacy and model security by avoiding direct sharing of raw data and model details (i.e., sever and clients only hold partial sub-networks and exchange intermediate computations). However, existing research has mainly focused on examining its reliability for privacy protection, with little investigation into model security. Specifically, by exploring full models, attackers can launch adversarial attacks, and split learning can mitigate this severe threat by only disclosing part of models to untrusted servers.This paper aims to evaluate the robustness of split learning against adversarial attacks, particularly in the most challenging setting where untrusted servers only have access to the intermediate layers of the model.Existing adversarial attacks mostly focus on the centralized setting instead of the collaborative setting, thus, to better evaluate the robustness of split learning, we develop a tailored attack called SPADV, which comprises two stages: 1) shadow model training that addresses the issue of lacking part of the model and 2) local adversarial attack that produces adversarial examples to evaluate.The first stage only requires a few unlabeled non-IID data, and, in the second stage, SPADV perturbs the intermediate output of natural samples to craft the adversarial ones. The overall cost of the proposed attack process is relatively low, yet the empirical attack effectiveness is significantly high, demonstrating the surprising vulnerability of split learning to adversarial attacks.

> Wireless networks are vulnerable to physical layer spoofing attacks due to the wireless broadcast nature, thus, integrating communications and security (ICAS) is urgently needed for 6G endogenous security. In this letter, we propose an environment semantics enabled physical layer authentication network based on deep learning, namely EsaNet, to authenticate the spoofing from the underlying wireless protocol. Specifically, the frequency independent wireless channel fingerprint (FiFP) is extracted from the channel state information (CSI) of a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system based on environment semantics knowledge. Then, we transform the received signal into a two-dimensional red green blue (RGB) image and apply the you only look once (YOLO), a single-stage object detection network, to quickly capture the FiFP. Next, a lightweight classification network is designed to distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate users. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed EsaNet can effectively detect physical layer spoofing attacks and is robust in time-varying wireless environments.

> Deep Learning (DL) applications are being used to solve problems in critical domains (e.g., autonomous driving or medical diagnosis systems). Thus, developers need to debug their systems to ensure that the expected behavior is delivered. However, it is hard and expensive to debug DNNs. When the failure symptoms or unsatisfied accuracies are reported after training, we lose the traceability as to which part of the DNN program is responsible for the failure. Even worse, sometimes, a deep learning program has different types of bugs. To address the challenges of debugging DNN models, we propose a novel data-driven approach that leverages model features to learn problem patterns. Our approach extracts these features, which represent semantic information of faults during DNN training. Our technique uses these features as a training dataset to learn and infer DNN fault patterns. Also, our methodology automatically links bug symptoms to their root causes, without the need for manually crafted mappings, so that developers can take the necessary steps to fix faults. We evaluate our approach using real-world and mutated models. Our results demonstrate that our technique can effectively detect and diagnose different bug types. Finally, our technique achieved better accuracy, precision, and recall than prior work for mutated models. Also, our approach achieved comparable results for real-world models in terms of accuracy and performance to the state-of-the-art.

> IoT device identification is the process of recognizing and verifying connected IoT devices to the network. This is an essential process for ensuring that only authorized devices can access the network, and it is necessary for network management and maintenance. In recent years, machine learning models have been used widely for automating the process of identifying devices in the network. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise their accuracy and effectiveness. To better secure device identification models, discretization techniques enable reduction in the sensitivity of machine learning models to adversarial attacks contributing to the stability and reliability of the model. On the other hand, Ensemble methods combine multiple heterogeneous models to reduce the impact of remaining noise or errors in the model. Therefore, in this paper, we integrate discretization techniques and ensemble methods and examine it on model robustness against adversarial attacks. In other words, we propose a discretization-based ensemble stacking technique to improve the security of our ML models. We evaluate the performance of different ML-based IoT device identification models against white box and black box attacks using a real-world dataset comprised of network traffic from 28 IoT devices. We demonstrate that the proposed method enables robustness to the models for IoT device identification.

> Adversarial examples derived from deliberately crafted perturbations on visual inputs can easily harm decision process of deep neural networks. To prevent potential threats, various adversarial training-based defense methods have grown rapidly and become a de facto standard approach for robustness. Despite recent competitive achievements, we observe that adversarial vulnerability varies across targets and certain vulnerabilities remain prevalent. Intriguingly, such peculiar phenomenon cannot be relieved even with deeper architectures and advanced defense methods. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a causal approach called Adversarial Double Machine Learning (ADML), which allows us to quantify the degree of adversarial vulnerability for network predictions and capture the effect of treatments on outcome of interests. ADML can directly estimate causal parameter of adversarial perturbations per se and mitigate negative effects that can potentially damage robustness, bridging a causal perspective into the adversarial vulnerability. Through extensive experiments on various CNN and Transformer architectures, we corroborate that ADML improves adversarial robustness with large margins and relieve the empirical observation.

> Federated learning enables learning from decentralized data sources without compromising privacy, which makes it a crucial technique. However, it is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, where malicious clients interfere with the training process. Previous defense mechanisms have focused on the server-side by using careful model aggregation, but this may not be effective when the data is not identically distributed or when attackers can access the information of benign clients. In this paper, we propose a new defense mechanism that focuses on the client-side, called FedDefender, to help benign clients train robust local models and avoid the adverse impact of malicious model updates from attackers, even when a server-side defense cannot identify or remove adversaries. Our method consists of two main components: (1) attack-tolerant local meta update and (2) attack-tolerant global knowledge distillation. These components are used to find noise-resilient model parameters while accurately extracting knowledge from a potentially corrupted global model. Our client-side defense strategy has a flexible structure and can work in conjunction with any existing server-side strategies. Evaluations of real-world scenarios across multiple datasets show that the proposed method enhances the robustness of federated learning against model poisoning attacks.

> Anonymous microblogging systems are known to be vulnerable to intersection attacks due to network churn. An adversary that monitors all communications can leverage the churn to learn who is publishing what with increasing confidence over time. In this paper, we propose a protocol for mitigating intersection attacks in anonymous microblogging systems by grouping users into anonymity sets based on similarities in their publishing behavior. The protocol provides a configurable communication schedule for users in each set to manage the inevitable trade-off between latency and bandwidth overhead. In our evaluation, we use real-world datasets from two popular microblogging platforms, Twitter and Reddit, to simulate user publishing behavior. The results demonstrate that the protocol can protect users against intersection attacks at low bandwidth overhead when the users adhere to communication schedules. In addition, the protocol can sustain a slow degradation in the size of the anonymity set over time under various churn rates.

- *Daniel De Almeida Braga, Natalia Kulatova, Mohamed Sabt, Pierre-Alain Fouque, Karthikeyan Bhargavan*

- `2307.09243v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09243v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09243v1)

> It is universally acknowledged that Wi-Fi communications are important to secure. Thus, the Wi-Fi Alliance published WPA3 in 2018 with a distinctive security feature: it leverages a Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol to protect users' passwords from offline dictionary attacks. Unfortunately, soon after its release, several attacks were reported against its implementations, in response to which the protocol was updated in a best-effort manner.   In this paper, we show that the proposed mitigations are not enough, especially for a complex protocol to implement even for savvy developers. Indeed, we present **Dragondoom**, a collection of side-channel vulnerabilities of varying strength allowing attackers to recover users' passwords in widely deployed Wi-Fi daemons, such as hostap in its default settings. Our findings target both password conversion methods, namely the default probabilistic hunting-and-pecking and its newly standardized deterministic alternative based on SSWU. We successfully exploit our leakage in practice through microarchitectural mechanisms, and overcome the limited spatial resolution of Flush+Reload. Our attacks outperform previous works in terms of required measurements.   Then, driven by the need to end the spiral of patch-and-hack in Dragonfly implementations, we propose **Dragonstar**, an implementation of Dragonfly leveraging a formally verified implementation of the underlying mathematical operations, thereby removing all the related leakage vector. Our implementation relies on HACL*, a formally verified crypto library guaranteeing secret-independence. We design Dragonstar, so that its integration within hostap requires minimal modifications to the existing project. Our experiments show that the performance of HACL*-based hostap is comparable to OpenSSL-based, implying that Dragonstar is both efficient and proved to be leakage-free.

- *Haibin Zheng, Jinyin Chen, Haibo Jin*

- `2307.09375v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09375v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09375v1)

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their outperformance in various software systems, but also exhibit misbehavior and even result in irreversible disasters. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the misbehavior of DNN-based software and improve DNNs' quality. Test input prioritization is one of the most appealing ways to guarantee DNNs' quality, which prioritizes test inputs so that more bug-revealing inputs can be identified earlier with limited time and manual labeling efforts. However, the existing prioritization methods are still limited from three aspects: certifiability, effectiveness, and generalizability. To overcome the challenges, we propose CertPri, a test input prioritization technique designed based on a movement cost perspective of test inputs in DNNs' feature space. CertPri differs from previous works in three key aspects: (1) certifiable: it provides a formal robustness guarantee for the movement cost; (2) effective: it leverages formally guaranteed movement costs to identify malicious bug-revealing inputs; and (3) generic: it can be applied to various tasks, data, models, and scenarios. Extensive evaluations across 2 tasks (i.e., classification and regression), 6 data forms, 4 model structures, and 2 scenarios (i.e., white-box and black-box) demonstrate CertPri's superior performance. For instance, it significantly improves 53.97% prioritization effectiveness on average compared with baselines. Its robustness and generalizability are 1.41~2.00 times and 1.33~3.39 times that of baselines on average, respectively.

> Spam filters are a crucial component of modern email systems, as they help to protect users from unwanted and potentially harmful emails. However, the effectiveness of these filters is dependent on the quality of the machine learning models that power them. In this paper, we design backdoor attacks in the domain of spam filtering. By demonstrating the potential vulnerabilities in the machine learning model supply chain, we highlight the need for careful consideration and evaluation of the models used in spam filters. Our results show that the backdoor attacks can be effectively used to identify vulnerabilities in spam filters and suggest the need for ongoing monitoring and improvement in this area.

> Online communities develop unique characteristics, establish social norms, and exhibit distinct dynamics among their members. Activity in online communities often results in concrete ``off-line'' actions with a broad societal impact (e.g., political street protests and norms related to sexual misconduct). While community dynamics, information diffusion, and online collaborations have been widely studied in the past two decades, quantitative studies that measure the effectiveness of online communities in promoting their agenda are scarce. In this work, we study the correspondence between the effectiveness of a community, measured by its success level in a competitive online campaign, and the underlying dynamics between its members. To this end, we define a novel task: predicting the success level of online communities in Reddit's r/place - a large-scale distributed experiment that required collaboration between community members. We consider an array of definitions for success level; each is geared toward different aspects of collaborative achievement. We experiment with several hybrid models, combining various types of features. Our models significantly outperform all baseline models over all definitions of `success level'. Analysis of the results and the factors that contribute to the success of coordinated campaigns can provide a better understanding of the resilience or the vulnerability of communities to online social threats such as election interference or anti-science trends. We make all data used for this study publicly available for further research.

> The phrase "online harms" has emerged in recent years out of a growing political willingness to address the ethical and social issues associated with the use of the Internet and digital technology at large. The broad landscape that surrounds online harms gathers a multitude of disciplinary, sectoral and organizational efforts while raising myriad challenges and opportunities for the crossing entrenched boundaries. In this paper we draw lessons from a journey of co-creating a transdisciplinary knowledge infrastructure within a large research initiative animated by the online harms agenda. We begin with a reflection of the implications of mapping, taxonomizing and constructing knowledge infrastructures and a brief review of how online harm and adjacent themes have been theorized and classified in the literature to date. Grounded on our own experience of co-creating a map of online harms, we then argue that the map -- and the process of mapping -- perform three mutually constitutive functions, acting simultaneously as method, medium and provocation. We draw lessons from how an open-ended approach to mapping, despite not guaranteeing consensus, can foster productive debate and collaboration in ethically and politically fraught areas of research. We end with a call for CSCW research to surface and engage with the multiple temporalities, social lives and political sensibilities of knowledge infrastructures.

> Recent demand for distributed software had led to a surge in popularity in actor-based frameworks. However, even with the stylized message passing model of actors, writing correct distributed software is still difficult. We present our work on linearizability checking in DS2, an integrated framework for specifying, synthesizing, and testing distributed actor systems. The key insight of our approach is that often subcomponents of distributed actor systems represent common algorithms or data structures (e.g.\ a distributed hash table or tree) that can be validated against a simple sequential model of the system. This makes it easy for developers to validate their concurrent actor systems without complex specifications. DS2 automatically explores the concurrent schedules that system could arrive at, and it compares observed output of the system to ensure it is equivalent to what the sequential implementation could have produced. We describe DS2's linearizability checking and test it on several concurrent replication algorithms from the literature. We explore in detail how different algorithms for enumerating the model schedule space fare in finding bugs in actor systems, and we present our own refinements on algorithms for exploring actor system schedules that we show are effective in finding bugs.

> In a backdoor attack, an adversary inserts maliciously constructed backdoor examples into a training set to make the resulting model vulnerable to manipulation. Defending against such attacks typically involves viewing these inserted examples as outliers in the training set and using techniques from robust statistics to detect and remove them.   In this work, we present a different approach to the backdoor attack problem. Specifically, we show that without structural information about the training data distribution, backdoor attacks are indistinguishable from naturally-occurring features in the data--and thus impossible to "detect" in a general sense. Then, guided by this observation, we revisit existing defenses against backdoor attacks and characterize the (often latent) assumptions they make and on which they depend. Finally, we explore an alternative perspective on backdoor attacks: one that assumes these attacks correspond to the strongest feature in the training data. Under this assumption (which we make formal) we develop a new primitive for detecting backdoor attacks. Our primitive naturally gives rise to a detection algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees and is effective in practice.

- *Jaydeep Borkar*

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have a privacy concern because they memorize training data (including personally identifiable information (PII) like emails and phone numbers) and leak it during inference. A company can train an LLM on its domain-customized data which can potentially also include their users' PII. In order to comply with privacy laws such as the "right to be forgotten", the data points of users that are most vulnerable to extraction could be deleted. We find that once the most vulnerable points are deleted, a new set of points become vulnerable to extraction. So far, little attention has been given to understanding memorization for fine-tuned models. In this work, we also show that not only do fine-tuned models leak their training data but they also leak the pre-training data (and PII) memorized during the pre-training phase. The property of new data points becoming vulnerable to extraction after unlearning and leakage of pre-training data through fine-tuned models can pose significant privacy and legal concerns for companies that use LLMs to offer services. We hope this work will start an interdisciplinary discussion within AI and law communities regarding the need for policies to tackle these issues.

> Rule-based models, such as decision trees, appeal to practitioners due to their interpretable nature. However, the learning algorithms that produce such models are often vulnerable to spurious associations and thus, they are not guaranteed to extract causally-relevant insights. In this work, we build on ideas from the invariant causal prediction literature to propose Invariant Causal Set Covering Machines, an extension of the classical Set Covering Machine algorithm for conjunctions/disjunctions of binary-valued rules that provably avoids spurious associations. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that our method can identify the causal parents of a variable of interest in polynomial time.

> Over the years of challenges on detecting the crash consistency of non-volatile persistent memory (PM) bugs and developing new tools to identify those bugs are quite stretching due to its inconsistent behavior on the file or storage systems. In this paper, we evaluated an open-sourced automatic bug detector tool (i.e. AGAMOTTO) to test NVM level hashing PM application to identify performance and correctness PM bugs in the persistent (main) memory. Furthermore, our faithful validation tool able to discovered 65 new NVM level hashing bugs on PMDK library and it outperformed the number of bugs (i.e. 40 bugs) that WITCHER framework was able to identified. Finally, we will propose a Deep-Q Learning search heuristic algorithm over the PM-Aware search algorithm in the state selection process to improve the searching strategy efficiently.

> The practice of code reuse is crucial in software development for a faster and more efficient development lifecycle. In reality, however, code reuse practices lack proper control, resulting in issues such as vulnerability propagation and intellectual property infringements. Assembly clone search, a critical shift-right defence mechanism, has been effective in identifying vulnerable code resulting from reuse in released executables. Recent studies on assembly clone search demonstrate a trend towards using machine learning-based methods to match assembly code variants produced by different toolchains. However, these methods are limited to what they learn from a small number of toolchain variants used in training, rendering them inapplicable to unseen architectures and their corresponding compilation toolchain variants.   This paper presents the first study on the problem of assembly clone search with unseen architectures and libraries. We propose incorporating human common knowledge through large-scale pre-trained natural language models, in the form of transfer learning, into current learning-based approaches for assembly clone search. Transfer learning can aid in addressing the limitations of the existing approaches, as it can bring in broader knowledge from human experts in assembly code. We further address the sequence limit issue by proposing a reinforcement learning agent to remove unnecessary and redundant tokens. Coupled with a new Variational Information Bottleneck learning strategy, the proposed system minimizes the reliance on potential indicators of architectures and optimization settings, for a better generalization of unseen architectures. We simulate the unseen architecture clone search scenarios and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art solutions.

> The Cyber threats exposure has created worldwide pressure on organizations to comply with cyber security standards and policies for protecting their digital assets. Vulnerability assessment (VA) and Penetration Testing (PT) are widely adopted Security Compliance (SC) methods to identify security gaps and anticipate security breaches. In the computer networks context and despite the use of autonomous tools and systems, security compliance remains highly repetitive and resources consuming. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to tackle the ever-growing problem of efficiency and effectiveness in network infrastructures security auditing by formally introducing, designing, and developing an Expert-System Automated Security Compliance Framework (ESASCF) that enables industrial and open-source VA and PT tools and systems to extract, process, store and re-use the expertise in a human-expert way to allow direct application in similar scenarios or during the periodic re-testing. The implemented model was then integrated within the ESASCF and tested on different size networks and proved efficient in terms of time-efficiency and testing effectiveness allowing ESASCF to take over autonomously the SC in Re-testing and offloading Expert by automating repeated segments SC and thus enabling Experts to prioritize important tasks in Ad-Hoc compliance tests. The obtained results validate the performance enhancement notably by cutting the time required for an expert to 50% in the context of typical corporate networks first SC and 20% in re-testing, representing a significant cost-cutting. In addition, the framework allows a long-term impact illustrated in the knowledge extraction, generalization, and re-utilization, which enables better SC confidence independent of the human expert skills, coverage, and wrong decisions resulting in impactful false negatives.

> It is imperative to ensure the robustness of deep learning models in critical applications such as, healthcare. While recent advances in deep learning have improved the performance of volumetric medical image segmentation models, these models cannot be deployed for real-world applications immediately due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We present a 3D frequency domain adversarial attack for volumetric medical image segmentation models and demonstrate its advantages over conventional input or voxel domain attacks. Using our proposed attack, we introduce a novel frequency domain adversarial training approach for optimizing a robust model against voxel and frequency domain attacks. Moreover, we propose frequency consistency loss to regulate our frequency domain adversarial training that achieves a better tradeoff between model's performance on clean and adversarial samples.

> Generating realistic human flows across regions is essential for our understanding of urban structures and population activity patterns, enabling important applications in the fields of urban planning and management. However, a notable shortcoming of most existing mobility generation methodologies is neglect of prediction fairness, which can result in underestimation of mobility flows across regions with vulnerable population groups, potentially resulting in inequitable resource distribution and infrastructure development. To overcome this limitation, our study presents a novel, fairness-aware deep learning model, FairMobi-Net, for inter-region human flow prediction. The FairMobi-Net model uniquely incorporates fairness loss into the loss function and employs a hybrid approach, merging binary classification and numerical regression techniques for human flow prediction. We validate the FairMobi-Net model using comprehensive human mobility datasets from four U.S. cities, predicting human flow at the census-tract level. Our findings reveal that the FairMobi-Net model outperforms state-of-the-art models (such as the DeepGravity model) in producing more accurate and equitable human flow predictions across a variety of region pairs, regardless of regional income differences. The model maintains a high degree of accuracy consistently across diverse regions, addressing the previous fairness concern. Further analysis of feature importance elucidates the impact of physical distances and road network structures on human flows across regions. With fairness as its touchstone, the model and results provide researchers and practitioners across the fields of urban sciences, transportation engineering, and computing with an effective tool for accurate generation of human mobility flows across regions.

> Softwarization and virtualization in 5G and beyond necessitate thorough testing to ensure the security of critical infrastructure and networks, requiring the identification of vulnerabilities and unintended emergent behaviors from protocol designs to their software stack implementation. To provide an efficient and comprehensive solution, we propose a novel and first-of-its-kind approach that connects the strengths and coverage of formal and fuzzing methods to efficiently detect vulnerabilities across protocol logic and implementation stacks in a hierarchical manner. We design and implement formal verification to detect attack traces in critical protocols, which are used to guide subsequent fuzz testing and incorporate feedback from fuzz testing to broaden the scope of formal verification. This innovative approach significantly improves efficiency and enables the auto-discovery of vulnerabilities and unintended emergent behaviors from the 3GPP protocols to software stacks. Following this approach, we discover one identifier leakage model, one DoS attack model, and two eavesdrop attack models due to the absence of rudimentary MITM protection within the protocol, despite the existence of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) solution to this issue for over a decade. More remarkably, guided by the identified formal analysis and attack models, we exploit 61 vulnerabilities using fuzz testing demonstrated on srsRAN platforms. These identified vulnerabilities contribute to fortifying protocol-level assumptions and refining the search space. Compared to state-of-the-art fuzz testing, our united formal and fuzzing methodology enables auto-assurance by systematically discovering vulnerabilities. It significantly reduces computational complexity, transforming the non-practical exponential growth in computational cost into linear growth.

> Background: Software security is crucial to ensure that the users are protected from undesirable consequences such as malware attacks which can result in loss of data and, subsequently, financial loss. Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor incurred by suboptimal decisions resulting in long-term consequences such as increased defects and vulnerabilities if not managed. Although previous studies have studied the relationship between security and TD, examining their intersection in developers' discussion on Stack Overflow (SO) is still unexplored. Aims: This study investigates the characteristics of security-related TD questions on SO. More specifically, we explore the prevalence of TD in security-related queries, identify the security tags most prone to TD, and investigate which user groups are more aware of TD. Method: We mined 117,233 security-related questions on SO and used a deep-learning approach to identify 45,078 security-related TD questions. Subsequently, we conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of the collected security-related TD questions, including sentiment analysis. Results: Our analysis revealed that 38% of the security questions on SO are security-related TD questions. The most recurrent tags among the security-related TD questions emerged as "security" and "encryption." The latter typically have a neutral sentiment, are lengthier, and are posed by users with higher reputation scores. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that developers implicitly discuss TD, suggesting developers have a potential knowledge gap regarding the TD metaphor in the security domain. Moreover, we identified the most common security topics mentioned in TD-related posts, providing valuable insights for developers and researchers to assist developers in prioritizing security concerns in order to minimize TD and enhance software security.

> Due to the widespread application of deep neural networks~(DNNs) in safety-critical tasks, deep learning testing has drawn increasing attention. During the testing process, test cases that have been fuzzed or selected using test metrics are fed into the model to find fault-inducing test units (e.g., neurons and feature maps, activating which will almost certainly result in a model error) and report them to the DNN developer, who subsequently repair them~(e.g., retraining the model with test cases). Current test metrics, however, are primarily concerned with the neurons, which means that test cases that are discovered either by guided fuzzing or selection with these metrics focus on detecting fault-inducing neurons while failing to detect fault-inducing feature maps.   In this work, we propose DeepFeature, which tests DNNs from the feature map level. When testing is conducted, DeepFeature will scrutinize every internal feature map in the model and identify vulnerabilities that can be enhanced through repairing to increase the model's overall performance. Exhaustive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that (1) DeepFeature is a strong tool for detecting the model's vulnerable feature maps; (2) DeepFeature's test case selection has a high fault detection rate and can detect more types of faults~(comparing DeepFeature to coverage-guided selection techniques, the fault detection rate is increased by 49.32\%). (3) DeepFeature's fuzzer also outperforms current fuzzing techniques and generates valuable test cases more efficiently.

> Python has become the most popular programming language as it is friendly to work with for beginners. However, a recent study has found that most security issues in Python have not been indexed by CVE and may only be fixed by 'silent' security commits, which pose a threat to software security and hinder the security fixes to downstream software. It is critical to identify the hidden security commits; however, the existing datasets and methods are insufficient for security commit detection in Python, due to the limited data variety, non-comprehensive code semantics, and uninterpretable learned features. In this paper, we construct the first security commit dataset in Python, namely PySecDB, which consists of three subsets including a base dataset, a pilot dataset, and an augmented dataset. The base dataset contains the security commits associated with CVE records provided by MITRE. To increase the variety of security commits, we build the pilot dataset from GitHub by filtering keywords within the commit messages. Since not all commits provide commit messages, we further construct the augmented dataset by understanding the semantics of code changes. To build the augmented dataset, we propose a new graph representation named CommitCPG and a multi-attributed graph learning model named SCOPY to identify the security commit candidates through both sequential and structural code semantics. The evaluation shows our proposed algorithms can improve the data collection efficiency by up to 40 percentage points. After manual verification by three security experts, PySecDB consists of 1,258 security commits and 2,791 non-security commits. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive case study on PySecDB and discover four common security fix patterns that cover over 85% of security commits in Python, providing insight into secure software maintenance, vulnerability detection, and automated program repair.

> Deep learning has been rapidly employed in many applications revolutionizing many industries, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks pose a serious threat to deep learning-based systems compromising their integrity, reliability, and trust. Interpretable Deep Learning Systems (IDLSes) are designed to make the system more transparent and explainable, but they are also shown to be susceptible to attacks. In this work, we propose a novel microbial genetic algorithm-based black-box attack against IDLSes that requires no prior knowledge of the target model and its interpretation model. The proposed attack is a query-efficient approach that combines transfer-based and score-based methods, making it a powerful tool to unveil IDLS vulnerabilities. Our experiments of the attack show high attack success rates using adversarial examples with attribution maps that are highly similar to those of benign samples which makes it difficult to detect even by human analysts. Our results highlight the need for improved IDLS security to ensure their practical reliability.

> Fuzzing is a popular vulnerability automated testing method utilized by professionals and broader community alike. However, despite its abilities, fuzzing is a time-consuming, computationally expensive process. This is problematic for the open source community and smaller developers, as most people will not have dedicated security professionals and/or knowledge to perform extensive testing on their own. The goal of this project is to increase the efficiency of existing fuzzers by allowing fuzzers to explore more paths and find more bugs in shorter amounts of time, while still remaining operable on a personal device. To accomplish this, adversarial methods are built on top of current evolutionary algorithms to generate test cases for further and more efficient fuzzing. The results of this show that adversarial attacks do in fact increase outpaces existing fuzzers significantly and, consequently, crashes found.

- *Pengcheng, Peng, Yun, Qingzhao, Tao, Dawn, Prateek, Sanjeev, Zhuotao, Xusheng*

- `2307.08912v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08912v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08912v2)

> The increased adoption of smart contracts in many industries has made them an attractive target for cybercriminals, leading to millions of dollars in losses. Thus, deploying smart contracts with detected vulnerabilities (known to developers) are not acceptable, and fixing all the detected vulnerabilities is needed, which incurs high manual labor cost without effective tool support. To fill this need, in this paper, we propose ContractFix, a novel framework that automatically generates security patches for vulnerable smart contracts. ContractFix is a general framework that can incorporate different fix patterns for different types of vulnerabilities. Users can use it as a security fix-it tool that automatically applies patches and verifies the patched contracts before deploying the contracts. To address the unique challenges in fixing smart contract vulnerabilities, given an input smart contract, \tool conducts our proposed ensemble identification based on multiple static verification tools to identify vulnerabilities that are amenable for automatic fix. Then, ContractFix generates patches using template-based fix patterns and conducts program analysis (program dependency computation and pointer analysis) for smart contracts to accurately infer and populate the parameter values for the fix patterns. Finally, ContractFix performs static verification that guarantees the patched contract is free of vulnerabilities. Our evaluations on $144$ real vulnerable contracts demonstrate that \tool can successfully fix $94\%$ of the detected vulnerabilities ($565$ out of $601$) and preserve the expected behaviors of the smart contracts.

> Voice Recognition Systems (VRSs) employ deep learning for speech recognition and speaker recognition. They have been widely deployed in various real-world applications, from intelligent voice assistance to telephony surveillance and biometric authentication. However, prior research has revealed the vulnerability of VRSs to backdoor attacks, which pose a significant threat to the security and privacy of VRSs. Unfortunately, existing literature lacks a thorough review on this topic. This paper fills this research gap by conducting a comprehensive survey on backdoor attacks against VRSs. We first present an overview of VRSs and backdoor attacks, elucidating their basic knowledge. Then we propose a set of evaluation criteria to assess the performance of backdoor attack methods. Next, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of backdoor attacks against VRSs from different perspectives and analyze the characteristic of different categories. After that, we comprehensively review existing attack methods and analyze their pros and cons based on the proposed criteria. Furthermore, we review classic backdoor defense methods and generic audio defense techniques. Then we discuss the feasibility of deploying them on VRSs. Finally, we figure out several open issues and further suggest future research directions to motivate the research of VRSs security.

> Static analysis tools are traditionally used to detect and flag programs that violate properties. We show that static analysis tools can also be used to perturb programs that satisfy a property to construct variants that violate the property. Using this insight we can construct paired data sets of unsafe-safe program pairs, and learn strategies to automatically repair property violations. We present a system called \sysname, which automatically repairs information flow vulnerabilities using this approach. Since information flow properties are non-local (both to check and repair), \sysname also introduces a novel domain specific language (DSL) and strategy learning algorithms for synthesizing non-local repairs. We use \sysname to synthesize strategies for repairing two types of information flow vulnerabilities, unvalidated dynamic calls and cross-site scripting, and show that \sysname successfully repairs several hundred vulnerabilities from open source {\sc JavaScript} repositories, outperforming neural baselines built using {\sc CodeT5} and {\sc Codex}. Our datasets can be downloaded from \url{http://aka.ms/StaticFixer}.

> Intel processors utilize the retirement to orderly retire the micro-ops that have been executed out of order. To enhance retirement utilization, the retirement is dynamically shared between two logical cores on the same physical core. However, this shared retirement mechanism creates a potential vulnerability wherein an attacker can exploit the competition for retirement to infer the data of a victim on another logical core on the same physical core. Based on this leakage, we propose two new covert channels: the Different Instructions (DI) covert channel using different instructions for information transmission, and the Same Instructions (SI) covert channel using the same instructions to transmit information. The DI covert channel can achieve 98.5% accuracy with a bandwidth of 1450 Kbps, while the SI covert channel can achieve 94.85% accuracy with a bandwidth of 483.33 Kbps. Furthermore, this paper explores additional applications of retirement: Firstly, retirement is applied to Spectre attacks, resulting in a new variant of Spectre v1, which can achieve 94.17% accuracy with a bandwidth of 29 Kbps; Secondly, retirement is leveraged to infer the programs being executed by the victim, which can infer 10 integer benchmarks of SPEC with 89.28% accuracy. Finally, we discuss possible protection against new covert channels.

> RISC-V is a recently developed open instruction set architecture gaining a lot of attention. To achieve a lasting security on these systems and design efficient countermeasures, a better understanding of vulnerabilities to novel and potential future attacks is mandatory. This paper demonstrates that RISC-V is sensible to Jump-Oriented Programming, a class of complex code-reuse attacks. We provide an analysis of new dispatcher gadgets we discovered, and show how they can be used together in order to build a stealth attack, bypassing existing protections. A proof-of-concept attack is implemented on an embedded web server compiled for RISC-V, in which we introduced a vulnerability, allowing an attacker to remotely read an arbitrary file from the host machine.

> The increasing importance of videos as a medium for engagement, communication, and content creation makes them critical for organizations to consider for user feedback. However, sifting through vast amounts of video content on social media platforms to extract requirements-relevant feedback is challenging. This study delves into the potential of TikTok and YouTube, two widely used social media platforms that focus on video content, in identifying relevant user feedback that may be further refined into requirements using subsequent requirement generation steps. We evaluated the prospect of videos as a source of user feedback by analyzing audio and visual text, and metadata (i.e., description/title) from 6276 videos of 20 popular products across various industries. We employed state-of-the-art deep learning transformer-based models, and classified 3097 videos consisting of requirements relevant information. We then clustered relevant videos and found multiple requirements relevant feedback themes for each of the 20 products. This feedback can later be refined into requirements artifacts. We found that product ratings (feature, design, performance), bug reports, and usage tutorial are persistent themes from the videos. Video-based social media such as TikTok and YouTube can provide valuable user insights, making them a powerful and novel resource for companies to improve customer-centric development.

> Vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and bicyclists, are at a higher risk of being involved in crashes with motor vehicles, and crashes involving VRUs also are more likely to result in severe injuries or fatalities. Signalized intersections are a major safety concern for VRUs due to their complex and dynamic nature, highlighting the need to understand how these road users interact with motor vehicles and deploy evidence-based countermeasures to improve safety performance. Crashes involving VRUs are relatively infrequent, making it difficult to understand the underlying contributing factors. An alternative is to identify and use conflicts between VRUs and motorized vehicles as a surrogate for safety performance. Automatically detecting these conflicts using a video-based systems is a crucial step in developing smart infrastructure to enhance VRU safety. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a study using video-based event monitoring system to assess VRU and motor vehicle interactions at fifteen signalized intersections across Pennsylvania to improve VRU safety performance. This research builds on that study to assess the reliability of automatically generated surrogates in predicting confirmed conflicts using advanced data-driven models. The surrogate data used for analysis include automatically collectable variables such as vehicular and VRU speeds, movements, post-encroachment time, in addition to manually collected variables like signal states, lighting, and weather conditions. The findings highlight the varying importance of specific surrogates in predicting true conflicts, some being more informative than others. The findings can assist transportation agencies to collect the right types of data to help prioritize infrastructure investments, such as bike lanes and crosswalks, and evaluate their effectiveness.

> Many automated test generation techniques have been developed to aid developers with writing tests. To facilitate full automation, most existing techniques aim to either increase coverage, or generate exploratory inputs. However, existing test generation techniques largely fall short of achieving more semantic objectives, such as generating tests to reproduce a given bug report. Reproducing bugs is nonetheless important, as our empirical study shows that the number of tests added in open source repositories due to issues was about 28% of the corresponding project test suite size. Meanwhile, due to the difficulties of transforming the expected program semantics in bug reports into test oracles, existing failure reproduction techniques tend to deal exclusively with program crashes, a small subset of all bug reports. To automate test generation from general bug reports, we propose LIBRO, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been shown to be capable of performing code-related tasks. Since LLMs themselves cannot execute the target buggy code, we focus on post-processing steps that help us discern when LLMs are effective, and rank the produced tests according to their validity. Our evaluation of LIBRO shows that, on the widely studied Defects4J benchmark, LIBRO can generate failure reproducing test cases for 33% of all studied cases (251 out of 750), while suggesting a bug reproducing test in first place for 149 bugs. To mitigate data contamination, we also evaluate LIBRO against 31 bug reports submitted after the collection of the LLM training data terminated: LIBRO produces bug reproducing tests for 32% of the studied bug reports. Overall, our results show LIBRO has the potential to significantly enhance developer efficiency by automatically generating tests from bug reports.

> Software bugs claim approximately 50% of development time and cost the global economy billions of dollars. Once a bug is reported, the assigned developer attempts to identify and understand the source code responsible for the bug and then corrects the code. Over the last five decades, there has been significant research on automatically finding or correcting software bugs. However, there has been little research on automatically explaining the bugs to the developers, which is essential but a highly challenging task. In this paper, we propose Bugsplainer, a transformer-based generative model, that generates natural language explanations for software bugs by learning from a large corpus of bug-fix commits. Bugsplainer can leverage structural information and buggy patterns from the source code to generate an explanation for a bug. Our evaluation using three performance metrics shows that Bugsplainer can generate understandable and good explanations according to Google's standard, and can outperform multiple baselines from the literature. We also conduct a developer study involving 20 participants where the explanations from Bugsplainer were found to be more accurate, more precise, more concise and more useful than the baselines.

> Fuzzing is an important method to discover vulnerabilities in programs. Despite considerable progress in this area in the past years, measuring and comparing the effectiveness of fuzzers is still an open research question. In software testing, the gold standard for evaluating test quality is mutation analysis, which evaluates a test's ability to detect synthetic bugs: If a set of tests fails to detect such mutations, it is expected to also fail to detect real bugs. Mutation analysis subsumes various coverage measures and provides a large and diverse set of faults that can be arbitrarily hard to trigger and detect, thus preventing the problems of saturation and overfitting. Unfortunately, the cost of traditional mutation analysis is exorbitant for fuzzing, as mutations need independent evaluation.   In this paper, we apply modern mutation analysis techniques that pool multiple mutations and allow us -- for the first time -- to evaluate and compare fuzzers with mutation analysis. We introduce an evaluation bench for fuzzers and apply it to a number of popular fuzzers and subjects. In a comprehensive evaluation, we show how we can use it to assess fuzzer performance and measure the impact of improved techniques. The required CPU time remains manageable: 4.09 CPU years are needed to analyze a fuzzer on seven subjects and a total of 141,278 mutations. We find that today's fuzzers can detect only a small percentage of mutations, which should be seen as a challenge for future research -- notably in improving (1) detecting failures beyond generic crashes (2) triggering mutations (and thus faults).

> This paper undertakes a systematic review of relevant extant literature to consider the potential societal implications of the growth of AI in manufacturing. We analyze the extensive range of AI applications in this domain, such as interfirm logistics coordination, firm procurement management, predictive maintenance, and shop-floor monitoring and control of processes, machinery, and workers. Additionally, we explore the uncertain societal implications of industrial AI, including its impact on the workforce, job upskilling and deskilling, cybersecurity vulnerability, and environmental consequences. After building a typology of AI applications in manufacturing, we highlight the diverse possibilities for AI's implementation at different scales and application types. We discuss the importance of considering AI's implications both for individual firms and for society at large, encompassing economic prosperity, equity, environmental health, and community safety and security. The study finds that there is a predominantly optimistic outlook in prior literature regarding AI's impact on firms, but that there is substantial debate and contention about adverse effects and the nature of AI's societal implications. The paper draws analogies to historical cases and other examples to provide a contextual perspective on potential societal effects of industrial AI. Ultimately, beneficial integration of AI in manufacturing will depend on the choices and priorities of various stakeholders, including firms and their managers and owners, technology developers, civil society organizations, and governments. A broad and balanced awareness of opportunities and risks among stakeholders is vital not only for successful and safe technical implementation but also to construct a socially beneficial and sustainable future for manufacturing in the age of AI.

> In this paper, we present a stealthy and effective attack that exposes privacy vulnerabilities in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by inferring private links within graph-structured data. Focusing on the inductive setting where new nodes join the graph and an API is used to query predictions, we investigate the potential leakage of private edge information. We also propose methods to preserve privacy while maintaining model utility. Our attack demonstrates superior performance in inferring the links compared to the state of the art. Furthermore, we examine the application of differential privacy (DP) mechanisms to mitigate the impact of our proposed attack, we analyze the trade-off between privacy preservation and model utility. Our work highlights the privacy vulnerabilities inherent in GNNs, underscoring the importance of developing robust privacy-preserving mechanisms for their application.

> The paper applies reinforcement learning to novel Internet of Thing configurations. Our analysis of inaudible attacks on voice-activated devices confirms the alarming risk factor of 7.6 out of 10, underlining significant security vulnerabilities scored independently by NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Our baseline network model showcases a scenario in which an attacker uses inaudible voice commands to gain unauthorized access to confidential information on a secured laptop. We simulated many attack scenarios on this baseline network model, revealing the potential for mass exploitation of interconnected devices to discover and own privileged information through physical access without adding new hardware or amplifying device skills. Using Microsoft's CyberBattleSim framework, we evaluated six reinforcement learning algorithms and found that Deep-Q learning with exploitation proved optimal, leading to rapid ownership of all nodes in fewer steps. Our findings underscore the critical need for understanding non-conventional networks and new cybersecurity measures in an ever-expanding digital landscape, particularly those characterized by mobile devices, voice activation, and non-linear microphones susceptible to malicious actors operating stealth attacks in the near-ultrasound or inaudible ranges. By 2024, this new attack surface might encompass more digital voice assistants than people on the planet yet offer fewer remedies than conventional patching or firmware fixes since the inaudible attacks arise inherently from the microphone design and digital signal processing.

> Vision systems to see and reason about the compositional nature of visual scenes are fundamental to understanding our world. The complex relations between objects and their locations, ambiguities, and variations in the real-world environment can be better described in human language, naturally governed by grammatical rules and other modalities such as audio and depth. The models learned to bridge the gap between such modalities coupled with large-scale training data facilitate contextual reasoning, generalization, and prompt capabilities at test time. These models are referred to as foundational models. The output of such models can be modified through human-provided prompts without retraining, e.g., segmenting a particular object by providing a bounding box, having interactive dialogues by asking questions about an image or video scene or manipulating the robot's behavior through language instructions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of such emerging foundational models, including typical architecture designs to combine different modalities (vision, text, audio, etc), training objectives (contrastive, generative), pre-training datasets, fine-tuning mechanisms, and the common prompting patterns; textual, visual, and heterogeneous. We discuss the open challenges and research directions for foundational models in computer vision, including difficulties in their evaluations and benchmarking, gaps in their real-world understanding, limitations of their contextual understanding, biases, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and interpretability issues. We review recent developments in this field, covering a wide range of applications of foundation models systematically and comprehensively.

> Side-channel attacks pose significant challenges to the security of embedded systems, often allowing attackers to circumvent encryption algorithms in minutes compared to the trillions of years required for brute-force attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, various countermeasures have been developed. This study focuses on two specific countermeasures: randomization of the encryption algorithm's clock and the incorporation of a dummy core to disguise power traces.   The objective of this research is to identify the optimal frequencies that yield the highest level of randomness when these two countermeasures are combined. By investigating the interplay between clock randomization and the presence of dummy cores, we aim to enhance the overall security of embedded systems. The insights gained from this study will contribute to the development of more robust countermeasures against side-channel attacks, bolstering the protection of sensitive information and systems.   To achieve this, we conduct simulations and perform side-channel attacks on an FPGA to establish the relationship between frequencies and the resulting protection. We break the encryption on a non-duplicated circuit and note the least amount of measured power traces necessary and the timing overhead. We do this for all sets of frequencies considered which gives a good indication of which sets of frequencies give good protection. By comparing the frequencies generated with those from the duplicated circuit we use similar conclusions to prove whether a frequency set is secure or not.   Based on our results we argue that having one frequency lower than half of the base frequency and the other frequencies being close but not higher than the base gives the highest security compared to the timing overhead measured.

> Following their success in visual recognition tasks, Vision Transformers(ViTs) are being increasingly employed for image restoration. As a few recent works claim that ViTs for image classification also have better robustness properties, we investigate whether the improved adversarial robustness of ViTs extends to image restoration. We consider the recently proposed Restormer model, as well as NAFNet and the "Baseline network" which are both simplified versions of a Restormer. We use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and CosPGD, a recently proposed adversarial attack tailored to pixel-wise prediction tasks for our robustness evaluation. Our experiments are performed on real-world images from the GoPro dataset for image deblurring. Our analysis indicates that contrary to as advocated by ViTs in image classification works, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. We attempt to improve their robustness through adversarial training. While this yields a significant increase in robustness for Restormer, results on other networks are less promising. Interestingly, the design choices in NAFNet and Baselines, which were based on iid performance, and not on robust generalization, seem to be at odds with the model robustness. Thus, we investigate this further and find a fix.

> A diverse set of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming an integrated part of daily lives, and playing an increasingly vital role in various industry, enterprise and agricultural settings. The current IoT ecosystem relies on several IoT management platforms to manage and operate a large number of IoT devices, their data, and their connectivity. Considering their key role, these platforms must be properly secured against cyber attacks. In this work, we first explore the core operations/features of leading platforms to design a framework to perform a systematic security evaluation of these platforms. Subsequently, we use our framework to analyze a representative set of 52 IoT management platforms, including 42 web-hosted and 10 locally-deployable platforms. We discover a number of high severity unauthorized access vulnerabilities in 9/52 evaluated IoT management platforms, which could be abused to perform attacks such as remote IoT SIM deactivation, IoT SIM overcharging and IoT device data forgery. More seriously, we also uncover instances of broken authentication in 13/52 platforms, including complete account takeover on 8/52 platforms along with remote code execution on 2/52 platforms. In effect, 17/52 platforms were affected by vulnerabilities that could lead to platform-wide attacks. Overall, vulnerabilities were uncovered in 33 platforms, out of which 28 platforms responded to our responsible disclosure. We were also assigned 11 CVEs and awarded bounty for our findings.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). In addition, AEs have adversarial transferability, which means AEs generated for a source model can fool another black-box model (target model) with a non-trivial probability. In previous studies, it was confirmed that the vision transformer (ViT) is more robust against the property of adversarial transferability than convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as ConvMixer, and moreover encrypted ViT is more robust than ViT without any encryption. In this article, we propose a random ensemble of encrypted ViT models to achieve much more robust models. In experiments, the proposed scheme is verified to be more robust against not only black-box attacks but also white-box ones than convention methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages attack graphs to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of risk assessment. Attack graphs visually represent the various attack paths that adversaries can exploit within a system, enabling a systematic exploration of potential vulnerabilities. By extending attack graphs with capabilities to include countermeasures and consequences, they can be leveraged to constitute the complete risk assessment process. Our method offers a more streamlined and comprehensive analysis of system vulnerabilities, where system changes, or environment changes can easily be adapted and the issues exposing the highest risk can easily be identified. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study, as well as the applicability by combining existing risk assessment standards with our method. Our work aims to bridge the gap between risk assessment practices and evolving threat landscapes, offering an improved methodology for managing and mitigating risks in modern computer systems.

> Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing their local data, and becomes an important privacy-preserving machine learning framework. However, classical FL faces serious security and robustness problem, e.g., malicious clients can poison model updates and at the same time claim large quantities to amplify the impact of their model updates in the model aggregation. Existing defense methods for FL, while all handling malicious model updates, either treat all quantities benign or simply ignore/truncate the quantities of all clients. The former is vulnerable to quantity-enhanced attack, while the latter leads to sub-optimal performance since the local data on different clients is usually in significantly different sizes. In this paper, we propose a robust quantity-aware aggregation algorithm for federated learning, called FedRA, to perform the aggregation with awareness of local data quantities while being able to defend against quantity-enhanced attacks. More specifically, we propose a method to filter malicious clients by jointly considering the uploaded model updates and data quantities from different clients, and performing quantity-aware weighted averaging on model updates from remaining clients. Moreover, as the number of malicious clients participating in the federated learning may dynamically change in different rounds, we also propose a malicious client number estimator to predict how many suspicious clients should be filtered in each round. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedRA method in defending FL against quantity-enhanced attacks.

> Data-driven requirements engineering leverages the abundance of openly accessible and crowdsourced information on the web. By incorporating user feedback provided about a software product, such as reviews in mobile app stores, these approaches facilitate the identification of issues, bug fixes, and implementation of change requests. However, relying solely on user feedback about a software product limits the possibility of eliciting all requirements, as users may not always have a clear understanding of their exact needs from the software, despite their wealth of experience with the problem, event, or challenges they encounter and use the software to assist them. In this study, we propose a shift in requirements elicitation, focusing on gathering feedback related to the problem itself rather than relying solely on feedback about the software product. We conducted a case study on student requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic in a higher education institution. We gathered their communications from Reddit during the pandemic and employed multiple machine-learning and natural language processing techniques to identify requirement sentences. We achieved the F-score of 0.79 using Naive Bayes with TF-IDF when benchmarking multiple techniques. The results lead us to believe that mining requirements from communication about a problem are feasible. While we present the preliminary results, we envision a future where these requirements complement conventionally elicited requirements and help to close the requirements gap.

- `2211.08944v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08944v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08944v3)

> Stochastic restoration algorithms allow to explore the space of solutions that correspond to the degraded input. In this paper we reveal additional fundamental advantages of stochastic methods over deterministic ones, which further motivate their use. First, we prove that any restoration algorithm that attains perfect perceptual quality and whose outputs are consistent with the input must be a posterior sampler, and is thus required to be stochastic. Second, we illustrate that while deterministic restoration algorithms may attain high perceptual quality, this can be achieved only by filling up the space of all possible source images using an extremely sensitive mapping, which makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Indeed, we show that enforcing deterministic models to be robust to such attacks profoundly hinders their perceptual quality, while robustifying stochastic models hardly influences their perceptual quality, and improves their output variability. These findings provide a motivation to foster progress in stochastic restoration methods, paving the way to better recovery algorithms.

> Rapid growth of applying Machine Learning (ML) in different domains, especially in safety-critical areas, increases the need for reliable ML components, i.e., a software component operating based on ML. Understanding the bugs characteristics and maintenance challenges in ML-based systems can help developers of these systems to identify where to focus maintenance and testing efforts, by giving insights into the most error-prone components, most common bugs, etc. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of bugs in ML-based software systems and the difference between ML and non-ML bugs from the maintenance viewpoint. We extracted 447,948 GitHub repositories that used one of the three most popular ML frameworks, i.e., TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. After multiple filtering steps, we select the top 300 repositories with the highest number of closed issues. We manually investigate the extracted repositories to exclude non-ML-based systems. Our investigation involved a manual inspection of 386 sampled reported issues in the identified ML-based systems to indicate whether they affect ML components or not. Our analysis shows that nearly half of the real issues reported in ML-based systems are ML bugs, indicating that ML components are more error-prone than non-ML components. Next, we thoroughly examined 109 identified ML bugs to identify their root causes, symptoms, and calculate their required fixing time. The results also revealed that ML bugs have significantly different characteristics compared to non-ML bugs, in terms of the complexity of bug-fixing (number of commits, changed files, and changed lines of code). Based on our results, fixing ML bugs are more costly and ML components are more error-prone, compared to non-ML bugs and non-ML components respectively. Hence, paying a significant attention to the reliability of the ML components is crucial in ML-based systems.

> Localization in high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems is highly security critical. While the popular Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) based design can be more robust against single-source sensor spoofing attacks, it is found recently that state-of-the-art MSF algorithms is vulnerable to GPS spoofing alone due to practical factors, which can cause various road hazards such as driving off road or onto the wrong way. In this work, we perform the first systematic exploration of the novel usage of lane detection (LD) to defend against such attacks. We first systematically analyze the potentials of such a domain-specific defense opportunity, and then design a novel LD-based defense approach, $LD^3$, that aims at not only detecting such attacks effectively in the real time, but also safely stopping the victim in the ego lane upon detection considering the absence of onboard human drivers.   We evaluate $LD^3$ on real-world sensor traces and find that it can achieve effective and timely detection against existing attack with 100% true positive rates and 0% false positive rates. Results also show that $LD^3$ is robust to diverse environmental conditions and is effective at steering the AD vehicle to safely stop within the current traffic lane. We implement $LD^3$ on two open-source high-level AD systems, Baidu Apollo and Autoware, and validate its defense capability in both simulation and the physical world in end-to-end driving. We further conduct adaptive attack evaluations and find that $LD^3$ is effective at bounding the deviations from reaching the attack goals in stealthy attacks and is robust to latest LD-side attack.

> Generation-based fuzz testing can uncover various bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, compared to mutation-based fuzz testing, it takes much longer to develop a well-balanced generator that produces good test cases and decides where to break the underlying structure to exercise new code paths. We propose a novel approach to combine a trained test case generator deep learning model with a double deep Q-network (DDQN) for the first time. The DDQN guides test case creation based on a code coverage signal. Our approach improves the code coverage performance of the underlying generator model by up to 18.5\% for the Firefox HTML rendering engine compared to the baseline grammar based fuzzer.

> Powered by the rising popularity of deep learning techniques on smartphones, on-device deep learning models are being used in vital fields like finance, social media, and driving assistance.   Because of the transparency of the Android platform and the on-device models inside, on-device models on Android smartphones have been proven to be extremely vulnerable.   However, due to the challenge in accessing and analysing iOS app files, despite iOS being a mobile platform as popular as Android, there are no relevant works on on-device models in iOS apps.   Since the functionalities of the same app on Android and iOS platforms are similar, the same vulnerabilities may exist on both platforms.   In this paper, we present the first empirical study about on-device models in iOS apps, including their adoption of deep learning frameworks, structure, functionality, and potential security issues.   We study why current developers use different on-device models for one app between iOS and Android.   We propose a more general attack against white-box models that does not rely on pre-trained models and a new adversarial attack approach based on our findings to target iOS's gray-box on-device models.   Our results show the effectiveness of our approaches.   Finally, we successfully exploit the vulnerabilities of on-device models to attack real-world iOS apps.

> Context. The game industry is increasingly growing in recent years. Every day, millions of people play video games, not only as a hobby, but also for professional competitions (e.g., e-sports or speed-running) or for making business by entertaining others (e.g., streamers). The latter daily produce a large amount of gameplay videos in which they also comment live what they experience. But no software and, thus, no video game is perfect: Streamers may encounter several problems (such as bugs, glitches, or performance issues) while they play. Also, it is unlikely that they explicitly report such issues to developers. The identified problems may negatively impact the user's gaming experience and, in turn, can harm the reputation of the game and of the producer. Objective. In this paper, we propose and empirically evaluate GELID, an approach for automatically extracting relevant information from gameplay videos by (i) identifying video segments in which streamers experienced anomalies; (ii) categorizing them based on their type (e.g., logic or presentation); clustering them based on (iii) the context in which appear (e.g., level or game area) and (iv) on the specific issue type (e.g., game crashes). Method. We manually defined a training set for step 2 of GELID (categorization) and a test set for validating in isolation the four components of GELID. In total, we manually segmented, labeled, and clustered 170 videos related to 3 video games, defining a dataset containing 604 segments. Results. While in steps 1 (segmentation) and 4 (specific issue clustering) GELID achieves satisfactory results, it shows limitations on step 3 (game context clustering) and, above all, step 2 (categorization).

> The ever increasing popularity and availability of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) had a stark influence on microarchitectural attack research in academia, as their strong attacker model both boosts existing attack vectors and introduces several new ones. While many works have focused on Intel SGX, other TEEs like AMD SEV have recently also started to receive more attention. A common technique when attacking SGX enclaves is single-stepping, where the system's APIC timer is used to interrupt the enclave after every instruction. Single-stepping increases the temporal resolution of subsequent microarchitectural attacks to a maximum. A key driver in the proliferation of this complex attack technique was the SGX-Step framework, which offered a stable reference implementation for single-stepping and a relatively easy setup. In this paper, we demonstrate that SEV VMs can also be reliably single-stepped. To lay the foundation for further microarchitectural attack research against SEV, we introduce the reusable SEV-Step framework. Besides reliable single-stepping, SEV-Step provides easy access to common attack primitives like page fault tracking and cache attacks against SEV. All features can be used interactively from user space. We demonstrate SEV-Step's capabilities by carrying out an end-to-end cache attack against SEV that leaks the volume key of a LUKS2-encrypted disk. Finally, we show for the first time that SEV is vulnerable to Nemesis-style attacks, which allow to extract information about the type and operands of single-stepped instructions from SEV-protected VMs.

> Visual AI systems are vulnerable to natural and synthetic physical corruption in the real-world. Such corruption often arises unexpectedly and alters the model's performance. In recent years, the primary focus has been on adversarial attacks. However, natural corruptions (e.g., snow, fog, dust) are an omnipresent threat to visual AI systems and should be considered equally important. Many existing works propose interesting solutions to train robust models against natural corruption. These works either leverage image augmentations, which come with the additional cost of model training, or place suspicious patches in the scene to design unadversarial examples. In this work, we propose the idea of naturalistic support artifacts (NSA) for robust prediction. The NSAs are shown to be beneficial in scenarios where model parameters are inaccessible and adding artifacts in the scene is feasible. The NSAs are natural looking objects generated through artifact training using DC-GAN to have high visual fidelity in the scene. We test against natural corruptions on the Imagenette dataset and observe the improvement in prediction confidence score by four times. We also demonstrate NSA's capability to increase adversarial accuracy by 8\% on average. Lastly, we qualitatively analyze NSAs using saliency maps to understand how they help improve prediction confidence.

> As the network scale increases, existing fully distributed solutions start to lag behind the real-world challenges such as (1) slow information propagation, (2) network communication failures, and (3) external adversarial attacks. In this paper, we focus on hierarchical system architecture and address the problem of non-Bayesian learning over networks that are vulnerable to communication failures and adversarial attacks. On network communication, we consider packet-dropping link failures.   We first propose a hierarchical robust push-sum algorithm that can achieve average consensus despite frequent packet-dropping link failures. We provide a sparse information fusion rule between the parameter server and arbitrarily selected network representatives. Then, interleaving the consensus update step with a dual averaging update with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the proximal function, we obtain a packet-dropping fault-tolerant non-Bayesian learning algorithm with provable convergence guarantees.   On external adversarial attacks, we consider Byzantine attacks in which the compromised agents can send maliciously calibrated messages to others (including both the agents and the parameter server). To avoid the curse of dimensionality of Byzantine consensus, we solve the non-Bayesian learning problem via running multiple dynamics, each of which only involves Byzantine consensus with scalar inputs. To facilitate resilient information propagation across sub-networks, we use a novel Byzantine-resilient gossiping-type rule at the parameter server.

> Search engines are vulnerable to attacks against indexing and searching via text encoding manipulation. By imperceptibly perturbing text using uncommon encoded representations, adversaries can control results across search engines for specific search queries. We demonstrate that this attack is successful against two major commercial search engines - Google and Bing - and one open source search engine - Elasticsearch. We further demonstrate that this attack is successful against LLM chat search including Bing's GPT-4 chatbot and Google's Bard chatbot. We also present a variant of the attack targeting text summarization and plagiarism detection models, two ML tasks closely tied to search. We provide a set of defenses against these techniques and warn that adversaries can leverage these attacks to launch disinformation campaigns against unsuspecting users, motivating the need for search engine maintainers to patch deployed systems.

> The 2021 Canadian census is notable for using a unique form of privacy, random rounding, which independently and probabilistically rounds discrete numerical attribute values. In this work, we explore how hierarchical summative correlation between discrete variables allows for both probabilistic and exact solutions to attribute values in the 2021 Canadian Census disclosure. We demonstrate that, in some cases, it is possible to "unround" and extract the original private values before rounding, both in the presence and absence of provided population invariants. Using these methods, we expose the exact value of 624 previously private attributes in the 2021 Canadian census disclosure. We also infer the potential values of more than 1000 private attributes with a high probability of correctness. Finally, we propose how a simple solution based on unbounded discrete noise can effectively negate exact unrounding while maintaining high utility in the final product.

> Power utilities are adopting Automated Demand Response (ADR) to replace the costly fuel-fired generators and to preempt congestion during peak electricity demand. Similarly, third-party Demand Response (DR) aggregators are leveraging controllable small-scale electrical loads to provide on-demand grid support services to the utilities. Some aggregators and utilities have started employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn the energy usage patterns of electricity consumers and use this knowledge to design optimal DR incentives. Such AI frameworks use open communication channels between the utility/aggregator and the DR customers, which are vulnerable to \textit{causative} data integrity cyberattacks. This paper explores vulnerabilities of AI-based DR learning and designs a data-driven attack strategy informed by DR data collected from the New York University (NYU) campus buildings. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and effects of maliciously tampering with (i) real-time DR incentives, (ii) DR event data sent to DR customers, and (iii) responses of DR customers to the DR incentives.

> The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial samples has been a major impediment to their broad applications, despite their success in various fields. Recently, some works suggested that adversarially-trained models emphasize the importance of low-frequency information to achieve higher robustness. While several attempts have been made to leverage this frequency characteristic, they have all faced the issue that applying low-pass filters directly to input images leads to irreversible loss of discriminative information and poor generalizability to datasets with distinct frequency features. This paper presents a plug-and-play module called the Frequency Preference Control Module that adaptively reconfigures the low- and high-frequency components of intermediate feature representations, providing better utilization of frequency in robust learning. Empirical studies show that our proposed module can be easily incorporated into any adversarial training framework, further improving model robustness across different architectures and datasets. Additionally, experiments were conducted to examine how the frequency bias of robust models impacts the adversarial training process and its final robustness, revealing interesting insights.

> Ensuring equitable privacy experiences remains a challenge, especially for marginalised and vulnerable populations (MVPs) who often hesitate to participate or use digital services due to concerns about the privacy of their sensitive information. In response, security research has emphasised the importance of inclusive security and privacy practices to facilitate meaningful engagement of MVPs online. However, research in this area is still in its early stages, with other MVPs yet to be considered (such as low-income groups, and refugees), novel engagement methods yet to be explored, and limited support for software developers in building applications and services for MVPs. In 2022, we initiated a UK Research Council funded Equitable Privacy project to address these gaps. Our goal is to prioritise the privacy needs and requirements of MVPs in the design and development of software applications and services.   We design and implement a new participatory research approach -- community studybeds -- in collaboration with third-sector organisations that support MVPs to identify and tackle the challenges these groups encounter. In this paper, we share the initial reflections and experiences of the Equitable Privacy project, particularly emphasising the utilisation of our community studybeds.

> Tools that alert developers about library vulnerabilities depend on accurate, up-to-date vulnerability databases which are maintained by security researchers. These databases record the libraries related to each vulnerability. However, the vulnerability reports may not explicitly list every library and human analysis is required to determine all the relevant libraries. Human analysis may be slow and expensive, which motivates the need for automated approaches. Researchers and practitioners have proposed to automatically identify libraries from vulnerability reports using extreme multi-label learning (XML).   While state-of-the-art XML techniques showed promising performance, their experiment settings do not practically fit what happens in reality. Previous studies randomly split the vulnerability reports data for training and testing their models without considering the chronological order of the reports. This may unduly train the models on chronologically newer reports while testing the models on chronologically older ones. However, in practice, one often receives chronologically new reports, which may be related to previously unseen libraries. Under this practical setting, we observe that the performance of current XML techniques declines substantially, e.g., F1 decreased from 0.7 to 0.28 under experiments without and with consideration of chronological order of vulnerability reports.   We propose a practical library identification approach, namely CHRONOS, based on zero-shot learning. The novelty of CHRONOS is three-fold. First, CHRONOS fits into the practical pipeline by considering the chronological order of vulnerability reports. Second, CHRONOS enriches the data of the vulnerability descriptions and labels using a carefully designed data enhancement step. Third, CHRONOS exploits the temporal ordering of the vulnerability reports using a cache to prioritize prediction of...

> The last decade has witnessed many successes of deep learning-based models for industry-scale recommender systems. These models are typically trained offline in a batch manner. While being effective in capturing users' past interactions with recommendation platforms, batch learning suffers from long model-update latency and is vulnerable to system biases, making it hard to adapt to distribution shift and explore new items or user interests. Although online learning-based approaches (e.g., multi-armed bandits) have demonstrated promising theoretical results in tackling these challenges, their practical real-time implementation in large-scale recommender systems remains limited. First, the scalability of online approaches in servicing a massive online traffic while ensuring timely updates of bandit parameters poses a significant challenge. Additionally, exploring uncertainty in recommender systems can easily result in unfavorable user experience, highlighting the need for devising intricate strategies that effectively balance the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. In this paper, we introduce Online Matching: a scalable closed-loop bandit system learning from users' direct feedback on items in real time. We present a hybrid "offline + online" approach for constructing this system, accompanied by a comprehensive exposition of the end-to-end system architecture. We propose Diag-LinUCB -- a novel extension of the LinUCB algorithm -- to enable distributed updates of bandits parameter in a scalable and timely manner. We conduct live experiments in YouTube and show that Online Matching is able to enhance the capabilities of fresh content discovery and item exploration in the present platform.

> Deep neural networks, (DNNs, a.k.a. NNs), have been widely used in various tasks and have been proven to be successful. However, the accompanied expensive computing and storage costs make the deployments in resource-constrained devices a significant concern. To solve this issue, quantization has emerged as an effective way to reduce the costs of DNNs with little accuracy degradation by quantizing floating-point numbers to low-width fixed-point representations. Quantized neural networks (QNNs) have been developed, with binarized neural networks (BNNs) restricted to binary values as a special case. Another concern about neural networks is their vulnerability and lack of interpretability. Despite the active research on trustworthy of DNNs, few approaches have been proposed to QNNs. To this end, this paper presents an automata-theoretic approach to synthesizing BNNs that meet designated properties. More specifically, we define a temporal logic, called BLTL, as the specification language. We show that each BLTL formula can be transformed into an automaton on finite words. To deal with the state-explosion problem, we provide a tableau-based approach in real implementation. For the synthesis procedure, we utilize SMT solvers to detect the existence of a model (i.e., a BNN) in the construction process. Notably, synthesis provides a way to determine the hyper-parameters of the network before training.Moreover, we experimentally evaluate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the individual fairness and local robustness of BNNs while maintaining accuracy to a great extent.

> Software vulnerabilities pose significant risks to computer systems, impacting our daily lives, productivity, and even our health. Identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner is crucial to prevent hacking and data breaches. Unfortunately, current vulnerability identification methods, including classical and deep learning-based approaches, exhibit critical drawbacks that prevent them from meeting the demands of the contemporary software industry. To tackle these issues, we present JFinder, a novel architecture for Java vulnerability identification that leverages quad self-attention and pre-training mechanisms to combine structural information and semantic representations. Experimental results demonstrate that JFinder outperforms all baseline methods, achieving an accuracy of 0.97 on the CWE dataset and an F1 score of 0.84 on the PROMISE dataset. Furthermore, a case study reveals that JFinder can accurately identify four cases of vulnerabilities after patching.

> Automated program analysis is a pivotal research domain in many areas of Computer Science -- Formal Methods and Artificial Intelligence, in particular. Due to the undecidability of the problem of program equivalence, comparing two programs is highly challenging. Typically, in order to compare two programs, a relation between both programs' sets of variables is required. Thus, mapping variables between two programs is useful for a panoply of tasks such as program equivalence, program analysis, program repair, and clone detection. In this work, we propose using graph neural networks (GNNs) to map the set of variables between two programs based on both programs' abstract syntax trees (ASTs). To demonstrate the strength of variable mappings, we present three use-cases of these mappings on the task of program repair to fix well-studied and recurrent bugs among novice programmers in introductory programming assignments (IPAs). Experimental results on a dataset of 4166 pairs of incorrect/correct programs show that our approach correctly maps 83% of the evaluation dataset. Moreover, our experiments show that the current state-of-the-art on program repair, greatly dependent on the programs' structure, can only repair about 72% of the incorrect programs. In contrast, our approach, which is solely based on variable mappings, can repair around 88.5%.

> Several solutions ensuring the dynamic detection of malicious activities on Android ecosystem have been proposed. These are represented by generic rules and models that identify any purported malicious behavior. However, the approaches adopted are far from being effective in detecting malware (listed or not) and whose form and behavior are likely to be different depending on the execution environment or the design of the malware itself (polymorphic for example). An additional difficulty is added when these approaches are unable to capture, analyze, and classify all the execution paths incorporated in the analyzed application earlier. This suggests that the functionality of the analyzed application can constitute a potential risk but never explored or revealed. We have studied some malware detection techniques based on behavioral analysis of applications. The description, characteristics, and results obtained from each technique are presented in this article wherein we have also highlighted some open problems, challenges as well as the different possible future directions of research concerning behavioral analysis of malware.

> Blockchain-based decentralized identity management provides a promising solution to improve the security and privacy of healthcare systems and make them scalable. Traditional Identity Management Systems are centralized, which makes them single-point-of-failure, vulnerable to attacks and data breaches, and non-scalable. In contrast, decentralized identity management based on the blockchain can ensure secure and transparent access to patient data while preserving privacy. This approach enables patients to control their personal health data while granting permission for medical personnel to access specific information as needed. We propose a decentralized identity management system for healthcare systems named BDIMHS based on a permissioned blockchain with Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. We develop further descriptions of required functionalities and provide high-level procedures for network initialization, enrollment, registration, issuance, verification and revocation functionalities. The proposed solution improves data security, privacy, immutability, interoperability, and patient autonomy by using selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials. Furthermore, we discuss the potential challenges associated with implementing this technology in healthcare and evaluate the performance and security of the proposed solution.

> Confidential computing has gained prominence due to the escalating volume of data-driven applications (e.g., machine learning and big data) and the acute desire for secure processing of sensitive data, particularly, across distributed environments, such as edge-to-cloud continuum. Provided that the works accomplished in this emerging area are scattered across various research fields, this paper aims at surveying the fundamental concepts, and cutting-edge software and hardware solutions developed for confidential computing using trusted execution environments, homomorphic encryption, and secure enclaves. We underscore the significance of building trust in both hardware and software levels and delve into their applications particularly for machine learning (ML) applications. While substantial progress has been made, there are some barely-explored areas that need extra attention from the researchers and practitioners in the community to improve confidentiality aspects, develop more robust attestation mechanisms, and to address vulnerabilities of the existing trusted execution environments. Providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the confidential computing landscape, this survey enables researchers to advance this field to ultimately ensure the secure processing of users' sensitive data across a multitude of applications and computing tiers.

> Cybersecurity is an important topic which is often viewed as one that is inaccessible due to steep learning curves and a perceived requirement of needing specialist knowledge. With a constantly changing threat landscape, practical solutions such as best-practices are employed, but the number of critical cybersecurity-related incidents remains high. To address these concerns, the National Cyber Security Centre published a Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) to provide a comprehensive information base used to advise and underpin cybersecurity learning. Unfortunately, CyBOK contains over 1000 pages of in-depth material and may not be easy to navigate for novice individuals. Furthermore, it does not allow for easy expression of various cybersecurity scenarios that such individuals may be exposed to. As a solution to these two issues, we propose the use of a playing cards format to provide introductory cybersecurity knowledge that supports learning and discussion, using CyBOK as the foundation for the technical content. Upon evaluation in two user studies, we found that 80% of the participants agreed the cards provided them with introductory knowledge of cybersecurity topics, and 70% agreed the cards provided an interface for discussing topics and enabled them to make links between attacks, vulnerabilities and defences.

> Networked Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are proprietary industrial devices utilized in critical infrastructure that execute control logic applications in complex proprietary runtime environments that provide standardized access to the hardware resources in the PLC. These control applications are programmed in domain-specific IEC 61131-3 languages, compiled into a proprietary binary format, and process data provided via industrial protocols. Control applications present an attack surface threatened by manipulated traffic. For example, remote code injection in a control application would directly allow to take over the PLC, threatening physical process damage and the safety of human operators. However, assessing the security of control applications is challenging due to domain-specific challenges and the limited availability of suitable methods. Network-based fuzzing is often the only way to test such devices but is inefficient without guidance from execution tracing. This work presents the FieldFuzz framework that analyzes the security risks posed by the Codesys runtime (used by over 400 devices from 80 industrial PLC vendors). FieldFuzz leverages efficient network-based fuzzing based on three main contributions: i) reverse-engineering enabled remote control of control applications and runtime components, ii) automated command discovery and status code extraction via network traffic and iii) a monitoring setup to allow on-system tracing and coverage computation. We use FieldFuzz to run fuzzing campaigns, which uncover multiple vulnerabilities, leading to three reported CVE IDs. To study the cross-platform applicability of FieldFuzz, we reproduce the findings on a diverse set of Industrial Control System (ICS) devices, showing a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.

> Recent years have shown increased cyber attacks targeting less secure elements in the software supply chain and causing fatal damage to businesses and organizations. Past well-known examples of software supply chain attacks are the SolarWinds or log4j incidents that have affected thousands of customers and businesses. The US government and industry are equally interested in enhancing software supply chain security. On February 22, 2023, researchers from the NSF-supported Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) conducted a Secure Software Supply Chain Summit with a diverse set of 17 practitioners from 15 companies. The goal of the Summit is to enable sharing between industry practitioners having practical experiences and challenges with software supply chain security and helping to form new collaborations. We conducted six-panel discussions based upon open-ended questions regarding software bill of materials (SBOMs), malicious commits, choosing new dependencies, build and deploy,the Executive Order 14028, and vulnerable dependencies. The open discussions enabled mutual sharing and shed light on common challenges that industry practitioners with practical experience face when securing their software supply chain. In this paper, we provide a summary of the Summit. Full panel questions can be found in the appendix.

> Neural ranking models (NRMs) have undergone significant development and have become integral components of information retrieval (IR) systems. Unfortunately, recent research has unveiled the vulnerability of NRMs to adversarial document manipulations, potentially exploited by malicious search engine optimization practitioners. While progress in adversarial attack strategies aids in identifying the potential weaknesses of NRMs before their deployment, the defensive measures against such attacks, like the detection of adversarial documents, remain inadequately explored. To mitigate this gap, this paper establishes a benchmark dataset to facilitate the investigation of adversarial ranking defense and introduces two types of detection tasks for adversarial documents. A comprehensive investigation of the performance of several detection baselines is conducted, which involve examining the spamicity, perplexity, and linguistic acceptability, and utilizing supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that a supervised classifier can effectively mitigate known attacks, but it performs poorly against unseen attacks. Furthermore, such classifier should avoid using query text to prevent learning the classification on relevance, as it might lead to the inadvertent discarding of relevant documents.

> Binary analyses based on deep neural networks (DNNs), or neural binary analyses (NBAs), have become a hotly researched topic in recent years. DNNs have been wildly successful at pushing the performance and accuracy envelopes in the natural language and image processing domains. Thus, DNNs are highly promising for solving binary analysis problems that are typically hard due to a lack of complete information resulting from the lossy compilation process. Despite this promise, it is unclear that the prevailing strategy of repurposing embeddings and model architectures originally developed for other problem domains is sound given the adversarial contexts under which binary analysis often operates.   In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the current state of the art in neural function boundary detection is vulnerable to both inadvertent and deliberate adversarial attacks. We proceed from the insight that current generation NBAs are built upon embeddings and model architectures intended to solve syntactic problems. We devise a simple, reproducible, and scalable black-box methodology for exploring the space of inadvertent attacks - instruction sequences that could be emitted by common compiler toolchains and configurations - that exploits this syntactic design focus. We then show that these inadvertent misclassifications can be exploited by an attacker, serving as the basis for a highly effective black-box adversarial example generation process. We evaluate this methodology against two state-of-the-art neural function boundary detectors: XDA and DeepDi. We conclude with an analysis of the evaluation data and recommendations for how future research might avoid succumbing to similar attacks.

> Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an essential tool in securing cyberspace from a variety of security risks and unknown cyberattacks. A number of solutions have been implemented for Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) based NIDS. However, all these solutions are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which the malicious actor tries to evade or fool the model by injecting adversarial perturbed examples into the system. The main aim of this research work is to study powerful adversarial attack algorithms and their defence method on DL-based NIDS. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Carlini & Wagner (C&W) are four powerful adversarial attack methods implemented against the NIDS. As a defence method, Adversarial Training is used to increase the robustness of the NIDS model. The results are summarized in three phases, i.e., 1) before the adversarial attack, 2) after the adversarial attack, and 3) after the adversarial defence. The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System 2017 (CICIDS-2017) dataset is used for evaluation purposes with various performance measurements like f1-score, accuracy etc.

> Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques typically rely on a given test-suite to guide the repair process. Apart from the need to provide test oracles, this makes the produced patches prone to test data over-fitting. In this work, instead of relying on test cases, we show how to automatically repair memory safety issues, by leveraging static analysis (specifically Incorrectness Separation Logic) to guide repair. Our proposed approach learns what a desirable patch is by inspecting how close a patch is to fixing the bug based on the feedback from incorrectness separation logic based static analysis (specifically the Pulse analyser), and turning this information into a distribution of probabilities over context free grammars. Furthermore, instead of focusing on heuristics for reducing the search space of patches, we make repair scalable by creating classes of equivalent patches according to the effect they have on the symbolic heap, and then invoking the validation oracle only once per class of patch equivalence. This allows us to efficiently discover repairs even in the presence of a large pool of patch candidates offered by our generic patch synthesis mechanism. Experimental evaluation of our approach was conducted by repairing real world memory errors in OpenSSL, swoole and other subjects. The evaluation results show the scalability and efficacy of our approach in automatically producing high quality patches.

> Assigning importance weights to adversarial data has achieved great success in training adversarially robust networks under limited model capacity. However, existing instance-reweighted adversarial training (AT) methods heavily depend on heuristics and/or geometric interpretations to determine those importance weights, making these algorithms lack rigorous theoretical justification/guarantee. Moreover, recent research has shown that adversarial training suffers from a severe non-uniform robust performance across the training distribution, e.g., data points belonging to some classes can be much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than others. To address both issues, in this paper, we propose a novel doubly-robust instance reweighted AT framework, which allows to obtain the importance weights via exploring distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques, and at the same time boosts the robustness on the most vulnerable examples. In particular, our importance weights are obtained by optimizing the KL-divergence regularized loss function, which allows us to devise new algorithms with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on standard classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms related state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of average robust performance, and at the same time improves the robustness against attacks on the weakest data points. Codes will be available soon.

> Understanding and characterizing the vulnerability of urban infrastructures, which refers to the engineering facilities essential for the regular running of cities and that exist naturally in the form of networks, is of great value to us. Potential applications include protecting fragile facilities and designing robust topologies, etc. Due to the strong correlation between different topological characteristics and infrastructure vulnerability and their complicated evolution mechanisms, some heuristic and machine-assisted analysis fall short in addressing such a scenario. In this paper, we model the interdependent network as a heterogeneous graph and propose a system based on graph neural network with reinforcement learning, which can be trained on real-world data, to characterize the vulnerability of the city system accurately. The presented system leverages deep learning techniques to understand and analyze the heterogeneous graph, which enables us to capture the risk of cascade failure and discover vulnerable infrastructures of cities. Extensive experiments with various requests demonstrate not only the expressive power of our system but also transferring ability and necessity of the specific components.

> The deep neural network has attained significant efficiency in image recognition. However, it has vulnerable recognition robustness under extensive data uncertainty in practical applications. The uncertainty is attributed to the inevitable ambient noise and, more importantly, the possible adversarial attack. Dynamic methods can effectively improve the defense initiative in the arms race of attack and defense of adversarial examples. Different from the previous dynamic method depend on input or decision, this work explore the dynamic attributes in model level through dynamic ensemble selection technology to further protect the model from white-box attacks and improve the robustness. Specifically, in training phase the Dirichlet distribution is apply as prior of sub-models' predictive distribution, and the diversity constraint in parameter space is introduced under the lightweight sub-models to construct alternative ensembel model spaces. In test phase, the certain sub-models are dynamically selected based on their rank of uncertainty value for the final prediction to ensure the majority accurate principle in ensemble robustness and accuracy. Compared with the previous dynamic method and staic adversarial traning model, the presented approach can achieve significant robustness results without damaging accuracy by combining dynamics and diversity property.

> Autonomous collaborative networks of devices are rapidly emerging in numerous domains, such as self-driving cars, smart factories, critical infrastructure, and Internet of Things in general. Although autonomy and self-organization are highly desired properties, they increase vulnerability to attacks. Hence, autonomous networks need dependable mechanisms to detect malicious devices in order to prevent compromise of the entire network. However, current mechanisms to detect malicious devices either require a trusted central entity or scale poorly.   In this paper, we present GrandDetAuto, the first scheme to identify malicious devices efficiently within large autonomous networks of collaborating entities. GrandDetAuto functions without relying on a central trusted entity, works reliably for very large networks of devices, and is adaptable to a wide range of application scenarios thanks to interchangeable components. Our scheme uses random elections to embed integrity validation schemes in distributed consensus, providing a solution supporting tens of thousands of devices. We implemented and evaluated a concrete instance of GrandDetAuto on a network of embedded devices and conducted large-scale network simulations with up to 100000 nodes. Our results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme, revealing logarithmic growth in run-time and message complexity with increasing network size. Moreover, we provide an extensive evaluation of key parameters showing that GrandDetAuto is applicable to many scenarios with diverse requirements.

> The increasing usage of new data sources and machine learning (ML) technology in credit modeling raises concerns with regards to potentially unfair decision-making that rely on protected characteristics (e.g., race, sex, age) or other socio-economic and demographic data. The authors demonstrate the impact of such algorithmic bias in the microfinance context. Difficulties in assessing credit are disproportionately experienced among vulnerable groups, however, very little is known about inequities in credit allocation between groups defined, not only by single, but by multiple and intersecting social categories. Drawing from the intersectionality paradigm, the study examines intersectional horizontal inequities in credit access by gender, age, marital status, single parent status and number of children. This paper utilizes data from the Spanish microfinance market as its context to demonstrate how pluralistic realities and intersectional identities can shape patterns of credit allocation when using automated decision-making systems. With ML technology being oblivious to societal good or bad, we find that a more thorough examination of intersectionality can enhance the algorithmic fairness lens to more authentically empower action for equitable outcomes and present a fairer path forward. We demonstrate that while on a high-level, fairness may exist superficially, unfairness can exacerbate at lower levels given combinatorial effects; in other words, the core fairness problem may be more complicated than current literature demonstrates. We find that in addition to legally protected characteristics, sensitive attributes such as single parent status and number of children can result in imbalanced harm. We discuss the implications of these findings for the financial services industry.

> This research article analyses and demonstrates the hidden implications for fairness of seemingly neutral data coupled with powerful technology, such as machine learning (ML), using Open Banking as an example. Open Banking has ignited a revolution in financial services, opening new opportunities for customer acquisition, management, retention, and risk assessment. However, the granularity of transaction data holds potential for harm where unnoticed proxies for sensitive and prohibited characteristics may lead to indirect discrimination. Against this backdrop, we investigate the dimensions of financial vulnerability (FV), a global concern resulting from COVID-19 and rising inflation. Specifically, we look to understand the behavioral elements leading up to FV and its impact on at-risk, disadvantaged groups through the lens of fair interpretation. Using a unique dataset from a UK FinTech lender, we demonstrate the power of fine-grained transaction data while simultaneously cautioning its safe usage. Three ML classifiers are compared in predicting the likelihood of FV, and groups exhibiting different magnitudes and forms of FV are identified via clustering to highlight the effects of feature combination. Our results indicate that engineered features of financial behavior can be predictive of omitted personal information, particularly sensitive or protected characteristics, shedding light on the hidden dangers of Open Banking data. We discuss the implications and conclude fairness via unawareness is ineffective in this new technological environment.

Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow empower a large variety of intelligent systems, offering a multitude of algorithms and configuration options, applicable to numerous domains of systems. However, bugs in those popular deep learning libraries also may have dire consequences for the quality of systems they enable; thus, it is important to understand how bugs are identified and fixed in those libraries.   Inspired by a study of Jia et al., which investigates the bug identification and fixing process at TensorFlow, we characterize bugs in the PyTorch library, a very popular deep learning framework. We investigate the causes and symptoms of bugs identified during PyTorch's development, and assess their locality within the project, and extract patterns of bug fixes. Our results highlight that PyTorch bugs are more like traditional software projects bugs, than related to deep learning characteristics. Finally, we also compare our results with the study on TensorFlow, highlighting similarities and differences across the bug identification and fixing process.

- *Yuntong Zhang, Ridwan Shariffdeen, Gregory J. Duck, Jiaqi Tan, Abhik Roychoudhury*

- `2308.00666v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00666v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00666v1)

> Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems. Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs. If a bug is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. Like fuzzing, many existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than inputs.   In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing. The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather than the input space. Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch candidates and help in patch selection. To improve the throughput, we propose a compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original (unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific patched statements and expressions. Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec). We show that patch-level fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both spaces in order to find better quality patches. Such a collaboration between input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- subtle, perceptually indistinguishable perturbations of inputs that change the response of the model. In the context of vision, we hypothesize that an important contributor to the robustness of human visual perception is constant exposure to low-fidelity visual stimuli in our peripheral vision. To investigate this hypothesis, we develop \RBlur, an image transform that simulates the loss in fidelity of peripheral vision by blurring the image and reducing its color saturation based on the distance from a given fixation point. We show that compared to DNNs trained on the original images, DNNs trained on images transformed by \RBlur are substantially more robust to adversarial attacks, as well as other, non-adversarial, corruptions, achieving up to 25\% higher accuracy on perturbed data.

> This paper investigates the causal impact of negatively and positively toned ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) discussions on US students' anticipated labor market outcomes. Our findings reveal students reduce their confidence regarding their future earnings prospects after exposure to AI debates, and this effect is more pronounced after reading discussion excerpts with a negative tone. Unlike STEM majors, students in Non-STEM fields show asymmetric and pessimistic belief changes, suggesting that they might feel more vulnerable to emerging AI technologies. Pessimistic belief updates regarding future earnings are also prevalent among non-male students, indicating widespread AI concerns among vulnerable student subgroups. Educators, administrators, and policymakers may regularly engage with students to address their concerns and enhance educational curricula to better prepare them for a future that AI will inevitably shape.

> Smart contracts manage a large number of digital assets nowadays. Bugs in these contracts have led to significant financial loss. Verifying the correctness of smart contracts is, therefore, an important task. This paper presents an automated safety verification tool, DCV, that targets declarative smart contracts written in DeCon, a logic-based domain-specific language for smart contract implementation and specification. DCV proves safety properties by mathematical induction and can automatically infer inductive invariants using heuristic patterns, without annotations from the developer. Our evaluation on 20 benchmark contracts shows that DCV is effective in verifying smart contracts adapted from public repositories, and can verify contracts not supported by other tools. Furthermore, DCV significantly outperforms baseline tools in verification time.

> OAuth 2.0 is a popular authorization framework that allows third-party clients such as websites and mobile apps to request limited access to a user's account on another application. The specification classifies clients into different types based on their ability to keep client credentials confidential. It also describes different grant types for obtaining access to the protected resources, with the authorization code and implicit grants being the most commonly used. Each client type and associated grant type have their unique security and usability considerations. In this paper, we propose a new approach for OAuth ecosystem that combines different client and grant types into a unified singular protocol flow for OAuth (USPFO), which can be used by both confidential and public clients. This approach aims to reduce the vulnerabilities associated with implementing and configuring different client types and grant types. Additionally, it provides built-in protections against known OAuth 2.0 vulnerabilities such as client impersonation, token (or code) thefts and replay attacks through integrity, authenticity, and audience binding. The proposed USPFO is largely compatible with existing Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Proposed Standard Request for Comments (RFCs), OAuth 2.0 extensions and active internet drafts.

> The Non-Fungible-Token (NFT) market has experienced explosive growth in recent years. According to DappRadar, the total transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, reached 34.7 billion dollars in February 2023. However, the NFT market is mostly unregulated and there are significant concerns about money laundering, fraud and wash trading. The lack of industry-wide regulations, and the fact that amateur traders and retail investors comprise a significant fraction of the NFT market, make this market particularly vulnerable to fraudulent activities. Therefore it is essential to investigate and highlight the relevant risks involved in NFT trading. In this paper, we attempted to uncover common fraudulent behaviors such as wash trading that could mislead other traders. Using market data, we designed quantitative features from the network, monetary, and temporal perspectives that were fed into K-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm to sort traders into groups. Lastly, we discussed the clustering results' significance and how regulations can reduce undesired behaviors. Our work can potentially help regulators narrow down their search space for bad actors in the market as well as provide insights for amateur traders to protect themselves from unforeseen frauds.

> Binary similarity detection is a critical technique that has been applied in many real-world scenarios where source code is not available, e.g., bug search, malware analysis, and code plagiarism detection. Existing works are ineffective in detecting similar binaries in cases where different compiling optimizations, compilers, source code versions, or obfuscation are deployed.   We observe that all the cases do not change a binary's key code behaviors although they significantly modify its syntax and structure. With this key observation, we extract a set of key instructions from a binary to capture its key code behaviors. By detecting the similarity between two binaries' key instructions, we can address well the ineffectiveness limitation of existing works. Specifically, we translate each extracted key instruction into a self-defined key expression, generating a key-semantics graph based on the binary's control flow. Each node in the key-semantics graph denotes a key instruction, and the node attribute is the key expression. To quantify the similarity between two given key-semantics graphs, we first serialize each graph into a sequence of key expressions by topological sort. Then, we tokenize and concatenate key expressions to generate token lists. We calculate the locality-sensitive hash value for all token lists and quantify their similarity. %We implement a prototype, called SemDiff, consisting of two modules: graph generation and graph diffing. The first module generates a pair of key-semantics graphs and the second module diffs the graphs. Our evaluation results show that overall, SemDiff outperforms state-of-the-art tools when detecting the similarity of binaries generated from different optimization levels, compilers, and obfuscations. SemDiff is also effective for library version search and finding similar vulnerabilities in firmware.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have brought superb performance to various applications utilizing graph structural data, such as social analysis and fraud detection. The graph links, e.g., social relationships and transaction history, are sensitive and valuable information, which raises privacy concerns when using GNNs. To exploit these vulnerabilities, we propose VertexSerum, a novel graph poisoning attack that increases the effectiveness of graph link stealing by amplifying the link connectivity leakage. To infer node adjacency more accurately, we propose an attention mechanism that can be embedded into the link detection network. Our experiments demonstrate that VertexSerum significantly outperforms the SOTA link inference attack, improving the AUC scores by an average of $9.8\%$ across four real-world datasets and three different GNN structures. Furthermore, our experiments reveal the effectiveness of VertexSerum in both black-box and online learning settings, further validating its applicability in real-world scenarios.

> Deep hiding, embedding images with others using deep neural networks, has demonstrated impressive efficacy in increasing the message capacity and robustness of secret sharing. In this paper, we challenge the robustness of existing deep hiding schemes by preventing the recovery of secret images, building on our in-depth study of state-of-the-art deep hiding schemes and their vulnerabilities. Leveraging our analysis, we first propose a simple box-free removal attack on deep hiding that does not require any prior knowledge of the deep hiding schemes.   To improve the removal performance on the deep hiding schemes that may be enhanced by adversarial training, we further design a more powerful removal attack, efficient box-free removal attack (EBRA), which employs image inpainting techniques to remove secret images from container images. In addition, to ensure the effectiveness of our attack and preserve the fidelity of the processed container images, we design an erasing phase based on the locality of deep hiding to remove secret information and then make full use of the visual information of container images to repair the erased visual content. Extensive evaluations show our method can completely remove secret images from container images with negligible impact on the quality of container images.

> Federated learning enables data sharing in healthcare contexts where it might otherwise be difficult due to data-use-ordinances or security and communication constraints. Distributed and shared data models allow models to become generalizable and learn from heterogeneous clients. While addressing data security, privacy, and vulnerability considerations, data itself is not shared across nodes in a given learning network. On the other hand, FL models often struggle with variable client data distributions and operate on an assumption of independent and identically distributed data. As the field has grown, the notion of fairness-aware federated learning mechanisms has also been introduced and is of distinct significance to the healthcare domain where many sensitive groups and protected classes exist. In this paper, we create a benchmark methodology for FAFL mechanisms under various heterogeneous conditions on datasets in the healthcare domain typically outside the scope of current federated learning benchmarks, such as medical imaging and waveform data formats. Our results indicate considerable variation in how various FAFL schemes respond to high levels of data heterogeneity. Additionally, doing so under privacy-preserving conditions can create significant increases in network communication cost and latency compared to the typical federated learning scheme.

> Despite the broad application of Machine Learning models as a Service (MLaaS), they are vulnerable to model stealing attacks. These attacks can replicate the model functionality by using the black-box query process without any prior knowledge of the target victim model. Existing stealing defenses add deceptive perturbations to the victim's posterior probabilities to mislead the attackers. However, these defenses are now suffering problems of high inference computational overheads and unfavorable trade-offs between benign accuracy and stealing robustness, which challenges the feasibility of deployed models in practice. To address the problems, this paper proposes Isolation and Induction (InI), a novel and effective training framework for model stealing defenses. Instead of deploying auxiliary defense modules that introduce redundant inference time, InI directly trains a defensive model by isolating the adversary's training gradient from the expected gradient, which can effectively reduce the inference computational cost. In contrast to adding perturbations over model predictions that harm the benign accuracy, we train models to produce uninformative outputs against stealing queries, which can induce the adversary to extract little useful knowledge from victim models with minimal impact on the benign performance. Extensive experiments on several visual classification datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR10) demonstrate the superior robustness (up to 48% reduction on stealing accuracy) and speed (up to 25.4x faster) of our InI over other state-of-the-art methods. Our codes can be found in https://github.com/DIG-Beihang/InI-Model-Stealing-Defense.

> Dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) suffers from path explosion problem when the target program has many conditional branches. Classical approach for managing the path explosion problem is dynamic state merging. Dynamic state merging combines similar symbolic program states together to avoid the exponential growth of states in DSE. However, state merging still requires solver invocations at each branch point of the program even when both paths of the branch is feasible and, the best path search strategy for DSE may not create the best state merging opportunities. Some drawbacks of state merging can be mitigated by compile-time state merging i.e. branch elimination by converting control-flow into data-flow. In this paper, we propose a non-semantics preserving but failure-preserving compiler technique for removing expensive symbolic branches in a program to improve the scalability of DSE. We develop a framework for detecting spurious bugs that can be inserted by our transformation. Finally, we show that our transformation can significantly improve the performance of exhaustive DSE on variety of benchmarks and helps in achieving more coverage in a large real-world subjects within a limited time budget.

> Digital rights management (DRM) solutions aim to prevent the copying or distribution of copyrighted material. On mobile devices, a variety of DRM technologies have become widely deployed. However, a detailed security study comparing their internal workings, and their strengths and weaknesses, remains missing in the existing literature. In this paper, we present the first detailed security analysis of mobile DRM systems, addressing the modern paradigm of cloud-based content delivery followed by major platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime. We extensively analyse the security of three widely used DRM solutions -- Google Widevine, Apple FairPlay, and Microsoft PlayReady -- deployed on billions of devices worldwide. We then consolidate their features and capabilities, deriving common features and security properties for their evaluation. Furthermore, we identify some design-level shortcomings that render them vulnerable to emerging attacks within the state of the art, including micro-architectural side-channel vulnerabilities and an absence of post-quantum security. Lastly, we propose mitigations and suggest future directions of research.

> Reinforcement Learning (RL) is being increasingly used to learn and adapt application behavior in many domains, including large-scale and safety critical systems, as for example, autonomous driving. With the advent of plug-n-play RL libraries, its applicability has further increased, enabling integration of RL algorithms by users. We note, however, that the majority of such code is not developed by RL engineers, which as a consequence, may lead to poor program quality yielding bugs, suboptimal performance, maintainability, and evolution problems for RL-based projects. In this paper we begin the exploration of this hypothesis, specific to code utilizing RL, analyzing different projects found in the wild, to assess their quality from a software engineering perspective. Our study includes 24 popular RL-based Python projects, analyzed with standard software engineering metrics. Our results, aligned with similar analyses for ML code in general, show that popular and widely reused RL repositories contain many code smells (3.95% of the code base on average), significantly affecting the projects' maintainability. The most common code smells detected are long method and long method chain, highlighting problems in the definition and interaction of agents. Detected code smells suggest problems in responsibility separation, and the appropriateness of current abstractions for the definition of RL algorithms.

> Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including evasion and backdoor (poisoning) attacks. On the defense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and provable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness against backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we focus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general threat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified framework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be instantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor attacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the trained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the robustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that our robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is possible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such as K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training algorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such models. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine learning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for certified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN models on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed exact algorithm. Both the theoretic analysis and the comprehensive evaluation on diverse ML models and datasets shed light on further robust learning strategies against general training time attacks.

> Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks as illustrated by image classification models. Thoroughly understanding such attacks is critical in order to ensure the safety and robustness of critical AI tasks. However, most evasion attacks are difficult to deploy against a majority of AI systems because they have focused on image domain with only few constraints. An image is composed of homogeneous, numerical, continuous, and independent features, unlike many other input types to AI systems used in practice. Furthermore, some input types include additional semantic and functional constraints that must be observed to generate realistic adversarial inputs. In this work, we propose a new framework to enable the generation of adversarial inputs irrespective of the input type and task domain. Given an input and a set of pre-defined input transformations, our framework discovers a sequence of transformations that result in a semantically correct and functional adversarial input. We demonstrate the generality of our approach on several diverse machine learning tasks with various input representations. We also show the importance of generating adversarial examples as they enable the deployment of mitigation techniques.

> This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for detecting the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the wild by monitoring underground hacking forums. The increasing volume of posts discussing exploitation in the wild calls for an automatic approach to process threads and posts that will eventually trigger alarms depending on their content. To illustrate the proposed system, we use the CrimeBB dataset, which contains data scraped from multiple underground forums, and develop a supervised machine learning model that can filter threads citing CVEs and label them as Proof-of-Concept, Weaponization, or Exploitation. Leveraging random forests, we indicate that accuracy, precision and recall above 0.99 are attainable for the classification task. Additionally, we provide insights into the difference in nature between weaponization and exploitation, e.g., interpreting the output of a decision tree, and analyze the profits and other aspects related to the hacking communities. Overall, our work sheds insight into the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the wild and can be used to provide additional ground truth to models such as EPSS and Expected Exploitability.

> Cryptography is the science that secures data and communication over the network by applying mathematics and logic to design strong encryption methods. In the modern era of e-business and e-commerce the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA triad) of stored information as well as of transmitted data is very crucial. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a genetic molecule consisting of two linked strands that wind around each other to form a double helical structure. The backbone of each strand is made of alternating deoxyribose sugar and phosphate groups. To each sugar one of four bases are attached i.e., adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). DNA molecules, having the capacity to store, process and transmit information, inspires the idea of DNA cryptography. It is the rapid emerging unconventional techniques which combines the chemical characteristics of biological DNA sequences with classical cryptography to ensure non-vulnerable transmission of data. This innovative method is based on the notion of DNA computing. The methodologies of DNA cryptography are not coded mathematically; thus, it could be too secure to be cracked easily.

However, it is critical to acknowledge the potential misuse of these models, which could give rise to a spectrum of social and ethical dilemmas.

In response to this challenge, we introduce an unpretentious yet potent detection approach proficient in identifying synthetic text across a wide array of fields. Moreover, our detector demonstrates outstanding performance uniformly across various model architectures and decoding strategies. It also possesses the capability to identify text generated utilizing a potent detection-evasion technique. Our comprehensive research underlines our commitment to boosting the robustness and efficiency of machine-generated text detection mechanisms, particularly in the context of swiftly progressing and increasingly adaptive AI technologies.

- *Qinsheng Zhang, Jiaming Song, Yongxin Chen*

> Efficient differential equation solvers have significantly reduced the sampling time of diffusion models (DMs) while retaining high sampling quality. Among these solvers, exponential integrators (EI) have gained prominence by demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. However, existing high-order EI-based sampling algorithms rely on degenerate EI solvers, resulting in inferior error bounds and reduced accuracy in contrast to the theoretically anticipated results under optimal settings. This situation makes the sampling quality extremely vulnerable to seemingly innocuous design choices such as timestep schedules. For example, an inefficient timestep scheduler might necessitate twice the number of steps to achieve a quality comparable to that obtained through carefully optimized timesteps. To address this issue, we reevaluate the design of high-order differential solvers for DMs. Through a thorough order analysis, we reveal that the degeneration of existing high-order EI solvers can be attributed to the absence of essential order conditions. By reformulating the differential equations in DMs and capitalizing on the theory of exponential integrators, we propose refined EI solvers that fulfill all the order conditions, which we designate as Refined Exponential Solver (RES). Utilizing these improved solvers, RES exhibits more favorable error bounds theoretically and achieves superior sampling efficiency and stability in practical applications. For instance, a simple switch from the single-step DPM-Solver++ to our order-satisfied RES solver when Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) $=9$, results in a reduction of numerical defects by $25.2\%$ and FID improvement of $25.4\%$ (16.77 vs 12.51) on a pre-trained ImageNet diffusion model.

> The rapid growth of decentralized digital currencies, enabled by blockchain technology, has ushered in a new era of peer-to-peer transactions, revolutionizing the global economy. Cryptocurrency wallets, serving as crucial endpoints for these transactions, have become increasingly prevalent. However, the escalating value and usage of these wallets also expose them to significant security risks and challenges. This research aims to comprehensively explore the security aspects of cryptocurrency wallets. It provides a taxonomy of wallet types, analyzes their design and implementation, identifies common vulnerabilities and attacks, and discusses defense mechanisms and mitigation strategies. The taxonomy covers custodial, non-custodial, hot, and cold wallets, highlighting their unique characteristics and associated security considerations. The security analysis scrutinizes the theoretical and practical aspects of wallet design, while assessing the efficacy of existing security measures and protocols. Notable wallet attacks, such as Binance, Mt. Gox are examined to understand their causes and consequences. Furthermore, the paper surveys defense mechanisms, transaction monitoring, evaluating their effectiveness in mitigating threats.

> Quantization has emerged as an essential technique for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on devices with limited resources. However, quantized models exhibit vulnerabilities when exposed to various noises in real-world applications. Despite the importance of evaluating the impact of quantization on robustness, existing research on this topic is limited and often disregards established principles of robustness evaluation, resulting in incomplete and inconclusive findings. To address this gap, we thoroughly evaluated the robustness of quantized models against various noises (adversarial attacks, natural corruptions, and systematic noises) on ImageNet. The comprehensive evaluation results empirically provide valuable insights into the robustness of quantized models in various scenarios, for example: (1) quantized models exhibit higher adversarial robustness than their floating-point counterparts, but are more vulnerable to natural corruptions and systematic noises; (2) in general, increasing the quantization bit-width results in a decrease in adversarial robustness, an increase in natural robustness, and an increase in systematic robustness; (3) among corruption methods, \textit{impulse noise} and \textit{glass blur} are the most harmful to quantized models, while \textit{brightness} has the least impact; (4) among systematic noises, the \textit{nearest neighbor interpolation} has the highest impact, while bilinear interpolation, cubic interpolation, and area interpolation are the three least harmful. Our research contributes to advancing the robust quantization of models and their deployment in real-world scenarios.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attack, which does not affect the network's performance on clean data but would manipulate the network behavior once a trigger pattern is added. Existing defense methods have greatly reduced attack success rate, but their prediction accuracy on clean data still lags behind a clean model by a large margin. Inspired by the stealthiness and effectiveness of backdoor attack, we propose a simple but highly effective defense framework which injects non-adversarial backdoors targeting poisoned samples. Following the general steps in backdoor attack, we detect a small set of suspected samples and then apply a poisoning strategy to them. The non-adversarial backdoor, once triggered, suppresses the attacker's backdoor on poisoned data, but has limited influence on clean data. The defense can be carried out during data preprocessing, without any modification to the standard end-to-end training pipeline. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks with different architectures and representative attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectiveness with by far the lowest performance drop on clean data. Considering the surprising defense ability displayed by our framework, we call for more attention to utilizing backdoor for backdoor defense. Code is available at https://github.com/damianliumin/non-adversarial_backdoor.

> Despite its ever-increasing impact, security is not considered as a design objective in commercial electronic design automation (EDA) tools. This results in vulnerabilities being overlooked during the software-hardware design process. Specifically, vulnerabilities that allow leakage of sensitive data might stay unnoticed by standard testing, as the leakage itself might not result in evident functional changes. Therefore, EDA tools are needed to elaborate the confidentiality of sensitive data during the design process. However, state-of-the-art implementations either solely consider the hardware or restrict the expressiveness of the security properties that must be proven. Consequently, more proficient tools are required to assist in the software and hardware design. To address this issue, we propose SoftFlow, an EDA tool that allows determining whether a given software exploits existing leakage paths in hardware. Based on our analysis, the leakage paths can be retained if proven not to be exploited by software. This is desirable if the removal significantly impacts the design's performance or functionality, or if the path cannot be removed as the chip is already manufactured. We demonstrate the feasibility of SoftFlow by identifying vulnerabilities in OpenSSL cryptographic C programs, and redesigning them to avoid leakage of cryptographic keys in a RISC-V architecture.

> The current zero trust model adopted in System-on-Chip (SoC) design is vulnerable to various malicious entities, and modern SoC designs must incorporate various security policies to protect sensitive assets from unauthorized access. These policies involve complex interactions between multiple IP blocks, which poses challenges for SoC designers and security experts when implementing these policies and for system validators when ensuring compliance. Difficulties arise when upgrading policies, reusing IPs for systems targeting different security requirements, and the subsequent increase in design time and time-to-market. This paper proposes a generic and flexible framework, called DiSPEL, for enforcing security policies defined by the user represented in a formal way for any bus-based SoC design. It employs a distributed deployment strategy while ensuring trusted bus operations despite the presence of untrusted IPs. It relies on incorporating a dedicated, centralized module capable of implementing diverse security policies involving bus-level interactions while generating the necessary logic and appending in the bus-level wrapper for IP-level policies. The proposed architecture is generic and independent of specific security policy types supporting both synthesizable and non-synthesizable solutions. The experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and correctness in enforcing the security requirements and viability due to low overhead in terms of area, delay, and power consumption tested on open-source standard SoC benchmarks.

- `2308.02923v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02923v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02923v1)

> Deep automation provided by self-organizing network (SON) features and their emerging variants such as zero touch automation solutions is a key enabler for increasingly dense wireless networks and pervasive Internet of Things (IoT). To realize their objectives, most automation functionalities rely on the Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) reports. The MDT reports are used to generate inferences about network state and performance, thus dynamically change network parameters accordingly. However, the collection of MDT reports from commodity user devices, particularly low cost IoT devices, make them a vulnerable entry point to launch an adversarial attack on emerging deeply automated wireless networks. This adds a new dimension to the security threats in the IoT and cellular networks. Existing literature on IoT, SON, or zero touch automation does not address this important problem. In this paper, we investigate an impactful, first of its kind adversarial attack that can be launched by exploiting the malicious MDT reports from the compromised user equipment (UE). We highlight the detrimental repercussions of this attack on the performance of common network automation functions. We also propose a novel Malicious MDT Reports Identification framework (MRIF) as a countermeasure to detect and eliminate the malicious MDT reports using Machine Learning and verify it through a use-case. Thus, the defense mechanism can provide the resilience and robustness for zero touch automation SON engines against the adversarial MDT attacks

> Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning approach allowing participants to jointly train a model without having to share their private, potentially sensitive local datasets with others. Despite its benefits, FL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, in which an adversary injects manipulated model updates into the model aggregation process so that the resulting model will provide targeted false predictions for specific adversary-chosen inputs. Proposed defenses against backdoor attacks based on detecting and filtering out malicious model updates consider only very specific and limited attacker models, whereas defenses based on differential privacy-inspired noise injection significantly deteriorate the benign performance of the aggregated model. To address these deficiencies, we introduce FLAME, a defense framework that estimates the sufficient amount of noise to be injected to ensure the elimination of backdoors while maintaining the model performance. To minimize the required amount of noise, FLAME uses a model clustering and weight clipping approach. Our evaluation of FLAME on several datasets stemming from application areas including image classification, word prediction, and IoT intrusion detection demonstrates that FLAME removes backdoors effectively with a negligible impact on the benign performance of the models. Furthermore, following the considerable attention that our research has received after its presentation at USENIX SEC 2022, FLAME has become the subject of numerous investigations proposing diverse attack methodologies in an attempt to circumvent it. As a response to these endeavors, we provide a comprehensive analysis of these attempts. Our findings show that these papers (e.g., 3DFed [36]) have not fully comprehended nor correctly employed the fundamental principles underlying FLAME, i.e., our defense mechanism effectively repels these attempted attacks.

> For the past 20 years, China has increasingly restricted the access of minors to online games using addiction prevention systems (APSes). At the same time, and through different means, i.e., the Great Firewall of China (GFW), it also restricts general population access to the international Internet. This paper studies how these restrictions impact young online gamers, and their evasion efforts. We present results from surveys (n = 2,415) and semi-structured interviews (n = 35) revealing viable commonly deployed APS evasion techniques and APS vulnerabilities. We conclude that the APS does not work as designed, even against very young online game players, and can act as a censorship evasion training ground for tomorrow's adults, by familiarization with and normalization of general evasion techniques, and desensitization to their dangers. Findings from these studies may further inform developers of censorship-resistant systems about the perceptions and evasion strategies of their prospective users, and help design tools that leverage services and platforms popular among the censored audience.

> This paper makes two key contributions. First, it argues that highly specialized rare content classifiers trained on small data typically have limited exposure to the richness and topical diversity of the negative class (dubbed anticontent) as observed in the wild. As a result, these classifiers' strong performance observed on the test set may not translate into real-world settings. In the context of COVID-19 misinformation detection, we conduct an in-the-wild audit of multiple datasets and demonstrate that models trained with several prominently cited recent datasets are vulnerable to anticontent when evaluated in the wild. Second, we present a novel active learning pipeline that requires zero manual annotation and iteratively augments the training data with challenging anticontent, robustifying these classifiers.

> Code cloning, the duplication of code fragments, is common in software development. While some reuse aids productivity, excessive cloning hurts maintainability and introduces bugs. Hence, automatic code clone detection is vital. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) possess diverse code-related knowledge, making them versatile for various software engineering challenges. However, LLMs' performance in code clone detection is unclear and needs more study for accurate assessment. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for clone detection, covering different clone types, languages, and prompts. We find advanced LLMs excel in detecting complex semantic clones, surpassing existing methods. Adding intermediate reasoning steps via chain-of-thought prompts noticeably enhances performance. Additionally, representing code as vector embeddings, especially with text encoders, effectively aids clone detection.Lastly, the ability of LLMs to detect code clones differs among various programming languages. Our study suggests that LLMs have potential for clone detection due to their language capabilities, offering insights for developing robust LLM-based methods to enhance software engineering.

> We present P4Testgen, a test oracle for the P4$_{16}$ language. P4Testgen supports automatic test generation for any P4 target and is designed to be extensible to many P4 targets. It models the complete semantics of the target's packet-processing pipeline including the P4 language, architectures and externs, and target-specific extensions. To handle non-deterministic behaviors and complex externs (e.g., checksums and hash functions), P4Testgen uses taint tracking and concolic execution. It also provides path selection strategies that reduce the number of tests required to achieve full coverage.   We have instantiated P4Testgen for the V1model, eBPF, PNA, and Tofino P4 architectures. Each extension required effort commensurate with the complexity of the target. We validated the tests generated by P4Testgen by running them across the entire P4C test suite as well as the programs supplied with the Tofino P4 Studio. Using the tool, we have also confirmed 25 bugs in mature, production toolchains for BMv2 and Tofino.

> WebAssembly (Wasm) is an emerging binary format that draws great attention from our community. However, Wasm binaries are weakly protected, as they can be read, edited, and manipulated by adversaries using either the officially provided readable text format (i.e., wat) or some advanced binary analysis tools. Reverse engineering of Wasm binaries is often used for nefarious intentions, e.g., identifying and exploiting both classic vulnerabilities and Wasm specific vulnerabilities exposed in the binaries. However, no Wasm-specific obfuscator is available in our community to secure the Wasm binaries. To fill the gap, in this paper, we present WASMixer, the first general-purpose Wasm binary obfuscator, enforcing data-level (string literals and function names) and code-level (control flow and instructions) obfuscation for Wasm binaries. We propose a series of key techniques to overcome challenges during Wasm binary rewriting, including an on-demand decryption method to minimize the impact brought by decrypting the data in memory area, and code splitting/reconstructing algorithms to handle structured control flow in Wasm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the correctness, effectiveness and efficiency of WASMixer. Our research has shed light on the promising direction of Wasm binary research, including Wasm code protection, Wasm binary diversification, and the attack-defense arm race of Wasm binaries.

> Formal method-based analysis of the 5G Wireless Communication Protocol is crucial for identifying logical vulnerabilities and facilitating an all-encompassing security assessment, especially in the design phase. Natural Language Processing (NLP) assisted techniques and most of the tools are not widely adopted by the industry and research community. Traditional formal verification through a mathematics approach heavily relied on manual logical abstraction prone to being time-consuming, and error-prone. The reason that the NLP-assisted method did not apply in industrial research may be due to the ambiguity in the natural language of the protocol designs nature is controversial to the explicitness of formal verification. To address the challenge of adopting the formal methods in protocol designs, targeting (3GPP) protocols that are written in natural language, in this study, we propose a hybrid approach to streamline the analysis of protocols. We introduce a two-step pipeline that first uses NLP tools to construct data and then uses constructed data to extract identifiers and formal properties by using the NLP model. The identifiers and formal properties are further used for formal analysis. We implemented three models that take different dependencies between identifiers and formal properties as criteria. Our results of the optimal model reach valid accuracy of 39% for identifier extraction and 42% for formal properties predictions. Our work is proof of concept for an efficient procedure in performing formal analysis for largescale complicate specification and protocol analysis, especially for 5G and nextG communications.

- `2308.03331v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03331v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03331v1)

> \textit{Federated learning} (FL) is a nascent distributed learning paradigm to train a shared global model without violating users' privacy. FL has been shown to be vulnerable to various Byzantine attacks, where malicious participants could independently or collusively upload well-crafted updates to deteriorate the performance of the global model. However, existing defenses could only mitigate part of Byzantine attacks, without providing an all-sided shield for FL. It is difficult to simply combine them as they rely on totally contradictory assumptions.   In this paper, we propose FPD, a \underline{\textbf{f}}our-\underline{\textbf{p}}ronged \underline{\textbf{d}}efense against both non-colluding and colluding Byzantine attacks. Our main idea is to utilize absolute similarity to filter updates rather than relative similarity used in existingI works. To this end, we first propose a reliable client selection strategy to prevent the majority of threats in the bud. Then we design a simple but effective score-based detection method to mitigate colluding attacks. Third, we construct an enhanced spectral-based outlier detector to accurately discard abnormal updates when the training data is \textit{not independent and identically distributed} (non-IID). Finally, we design update denoising to rectify the direction of the slightly noisy but harmful updates. The four sequentially combined modules can effectively reconcile the contradiction in addressing non-colluding and colluding Byzantine attacks. Extensive experiments over three benchmark image classification datasets against four state-of-the-art Byzantine attacks demonstrate that FPD drastically outperforms existing defenses in IID and non-IID scenarios (with $30\%$ improvement on model accuracy).

> Deep Learning has empowered us to train neural networks for complex data with high performance. However, with the growing research, several vulnerabilities in neural networks have been exposed. A particular branch of research, Adversarial Machine Learning, exploits and understands some of the vulnerabilities that cause the neural networks to misclassify for near original input. A class of algorithms called adversarial attacks is proposed to make the neural networks misclassify for various tasks in different domains. With the extensive and growing research in adversarial attacks, it is crucial to understand the classification of adversarial attacks. This will help us understand the vulnerabilities in a systematic order and help us to mitigate the effects of adversarial attacks. This article provides a survey of existing adversarial attacks and their understanding based on different perspectives. We also provide a brief overview of existing adversarial defences and their limitations in mitigating the effect of adversarial attacks. Further, we conclude with a discussion on the future research directions in the field of adversarial machine learning.

> Embedded devices are increasingly present in our everyday life. They often process critical information, and hence, rely on cryptographic protocols to achieve security. However, embedded devices remain vulnerable to attackers seeking to hijack their operation and extract sensitive information by exploiting side channels and code reuse. Code-Reuse Attacks (CRAs) can steer the execution of a program to malicious outcomes, altering existing on-board code without direct access to the device memory. Moreover, Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) may reveal secret information to the attacker based on mere observation of the device. Thwarting CRAs and SCAs against embedded devices is challenging because embedded devices are often resource constrained. Fine-grained code diversification hinders CRAs by introducing uncertainty to the binary code; while software mechanisms can thwart timing or power SCAs. The resilience to either attack may come at the price of the overall efficiency. Moreover, a unified approach that preserves these mitigations against both CRAs and SCAs is not available. In this paper, we propose a novel Secure Diversity by Construction (SecDivCon) approach that tackles this challenge. SecDivCon is a combinatorial compiler-based approach that combines software diversification against CRAs with software mitigations against SCAs. SecDivCon restricts the performance overhead introduced by the generated code that thwarts the attacks and hence, offers a secure-by-design approach enabling control over the performance-security trade-off. Our experiments, using 16 benchmark programs, show that SCA-aware diversification is effective against CRAs, while preserving SCA mitigation properties at a low, controllable overhead. Given the combinatorial nature of our approach, SecDivCon is suitable for small, performance-critical functions that are sensitive to SCAs.

> Although face recognition starts to play an important role in our daily life, we need to pay attention that data-driven face recognition vision systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, the current two categories of adversarial attacks, namely digital attacks and physical attacks both have drawbacks, with the former ones impractical and the latter one conspicuous, high-computational and inexecutable. To address the issues, we propose a practical, executable, inconspicuous and low computational adversarial attack based on LED illumination modulation. To fool the systems, the proposed attack generates imperceptible luminance changes to human eyes through fast intensity modulation of scene LED illumination and uses the rolling shutter effect of CMOS image sensors in face recognition systems to implant luminance information perturbation to the captured face images. In summary,we present a denial-of-service (DoS) attack for face detection and a dodging attack for face verification. We also evaluate their effectiveness against well-known face detection models, Dlib, MTCNN and RetinaFace , and face verification models, Dlib, FaceNet,and ArcFace.The extensive experiments show that the success rates of DoS attacks against face detection models reach 97.67%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, and the success rates of dodging attacks against all face verification models reach 100%.

> Vulnerabilities from third-party libraries (TPLs) have been unveiled to threaten the Maven ecosystem. Despite patches being released promptly after vulnerabilities are disclosed, the libraries and applications in the community still use the vulnerable versions, which makes the vulnerabilities persistent in the Maven ecosystem (e.g., the notorious Log4Shell still greatly influences the Maven ecosystem nowadays from 2021). Both academic and industrial researchers have proposed user-oriented standards and solutions to address vulnerabilities, while such solutions fail to tackle the ecosystem-wide persistent vulnerabilities because it requires a collective effort from the community to timely adopt patches without introducing breaking issues.   To seek an ecosystem-wide solution, we first carried out an empirical study to examine the prevalence of persistent vulnerabilities in the Maven ecosystem. Then, we identified affected libraries for alerts by implementing an algorithm monitoring downstream dependents of vulnerabilities based on an up-to-date dependency graph. Based on them, we further quantitatively revealed that patches blocked by upstream libraries caused the persistence of vulnerabilities. After reviewing the drawbacks of existing countermeasures, to address them, we proposed a solution for range restoration (Ranger) to automatically restore the compatible and secure version ranges of dependencies for downstream dependents. The automatic restoration requires no manual effort from the community, and the code-centric compatibility assurance ensures smooth upgrades to patched versions. Moreover, Ranger along with the ecosystem monitoring can timely alert developers of blocking libraries and suggest flexible version ranges to rapidly unblock patch versions. By evaluation, Ranger could restore 75.64% of ranges which automatically remediated 90.32% of vulnerable downstream projects.

Although these models can deliver satisfactory performance, they are far from perfect. Researchers have long studied the vulnerabilities and limitations of LLMs, such as adversarial attacks and model toxicity. Inevitably, commercial ML models are also not exempt from such issues, which can be problematic as MLaaS continues to grow. In this paper, we discover a new attack strategy against LLM APIs, namely the prompt abstraction attack. Specifically, we propose Mondrian, a simple and straightforward method that abstracts sentences, which can lower the cost of using LLM APIs. In this approach, the adversary first creates a pseudo API (with a lower established price) to serve as the proxy of the target API (with a higher established price). Next, the pseudo API leverages Mondrian to modify the user query, obtain the abstracted response from the target API, and forward it back to the end user. Our results show that Mondrian successfully reduces user queries' token length ranging from 13% to 23% across various tasks, including text classification, generation, and question answering. Meanwhile, these abstracted queries do not significantly affect the utility of task-specific and general language models like ChatGPT. Mondrian also reduces instruction prompts' token length by at least 11% without compromising output quality. As a result, the prompt abstraction attack enables the adversary to profit without bearing the cost of API development and deployment.

> Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) without the need of centralizing their data. Among other advantages, it comes with privacy-preserving properties making it attractive for application in sensitive contexts, such as health care or the military. Although the data are not explicitly exchanged, the training procedure requires sharing information about participants' models. This makes the individual models vulnerable to theft or unauthorized distribution by malicious actors. To address the issue of ownership rights protection in the context of Machine Learning (ML), DNN Watermarking methods have been developed during the last five years. Most existing works have focused on watermarking in a centralized manner, but only a few methods have been designed for FL and its unique constraints. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent advancements in Federated Learning watermarking, shedding light on the new challenges and opportunities that arise in this field.

> Cloud computing has become popular thanks to the widespread use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, allowing the community to conveniently manage and configure cloud infrastructure using scripts. However, the scripting process itself does not automatically prevent practitioners from introducing misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or privacy risks. As a result, ensuring security relies on practitioners understanding and the adoption of explicit policies, guidelines, or best practices. In order to understand how practitioners deal with this problem, in this work, we perform an empirical study analyzing the adoption of IaC scripted security best practices. First, we select and categorize widely recognized Terraform security practices promulgated in the industry for popular cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Next, we assess the adoption of these practices by each cloud provider, analyzing a sample of 812 open-source projects hosted on GitHub. For that, we scan each project configuration files, looking for policy implementation through static analysis (checkov). Additionally, we investigate GitHub measures that might be correlated with adopting these best practices. The category Access policy emerges as the most widely adopted in all providers, while Encryption in rest are the most neglected policies. Regarding GitHub measures correlated with best practice adoption, we observe a positive, strong correlation between a repository number of stars and adopting practices in its cloud infrastructure. Based on our findings, we provide guidelines for cloud practitioners to limit infrastructure vulnerability and discuss further aspects associated with policies that have yet to be extensively embraced within the industry.

> The vulnerability to adversarial perturbations is a major flaw of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that raises question about their reliability when in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, human perception, which DNNs are supposed to emulate, is highly robust to such perturbations, indicating that there may be certain features of the human perception that make it robust but are not represented in the current class of DNNs. One such feature is that the activity of biological neurons is correlated and the structure of this correlation tends to be rather rigid over long spans of times, even if it hampers performance and learning. We hypothesize that integrating such constraints on the activations of a DNN would improve its adversarial robustness, and, to test this hypothesis, we have developed the Self-Consistent Activation (SCA) layer, which comprises of neurons whose activations are consistent with each other, as they conform to a fixed, but learned, covariability pattern. When evaluated on image and sound recognition tasks, the models with a SCA layer achieved high accuracy, and exhibited significantly greater robustness than multi-layer perceptron models to state-of-the-art Auto-PGD adversarial attacks \textit{without being trained on adversarially perturbed data

Existing evaluation methods suffer from following shortcomings: (1) constrained evaluation abilities, (2) vulnerable benchmarks, (3) unobjective metrics. We suggest that task-based evaluation, where LLM agents complete tasks in a simulated environment, is a one-for-all solution to solve above problems. We present AgentSims, an easy-to-use infrastructure for researchers from all disciplines to test the specific capacities they are interested in. Researchers can build their evaluation tasks by adding agents and buildings on an interactive GUI or deploy and test new support mechanisms, i.e. memory, planning and tool-use systems, by a few lines of codes.

> Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: adding well-crafted, imperceptible perturbations to their input can modify their output. Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to training robust models against such attacks. Unfortunately, this method is much slower than vanilla training of neural networks since it needs to construct adversarial examples for the entire training data at every iteration. By leveraging the theory of coreset selection, we show how selecting a small subset of training data provides a principled approach to reducing the time complexity of robust training. To this end, we first provide convergence guarantees for adversarial coreset selection. In particular, we show that the convergence bound is directly related to how well our coresets can approximate the gradient computed over the entire training data. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we propose using this gradient approximation error as our adversarial coreset selection objective to reduce the training set size effectively. Once built, we run adversarial training over this subset of the training data. Unlike existing methods, our approach can be adapted to a wide variety of training objectives, including TRADES, $\ell_p$-PGD, and Perceptual Adversarial Training. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach speeds up adversarial training by 2-3 times while experiencing a slight degradation in the clean and robust accuracy.

> Kernel fuzzing is important for finding critical kernel vulnerabilities. Close-source (e.g., Windows) operating system kernel fuzzing is even more challenging due to the lack of source code. Existing approaches fuzz the kernel by modeling syscall sequences from traces or static analysis of system codes. However, a common limitation is that they do not learn and mutate the syscall sequences to reach different kernel states, which can potentially result in more bugs or crashes.   In this paper, we propose WinkFuzz, an approach to learn and mutate traced syscall sequences in order to reach different kernel states. WinkFuzz learns syscall dependencies from the trace, identifies potential syscalls in the trace that can have dependent subsequent syscalls, and applies the dependencies to insert more syscalls while preserving the dependencies into the trace. Then WinkFuzz fuzzes the synthesized new syscall sequence to find system crashes.   We applied WinkFuzz to four seed applications and found a total increase in syscall number of 70.8\%, with a success rate of 61\%, within three insert levels. The average time for tracing, dependency analysis, recovering model script, and synthesizing script was 600, 39, 34, and 129 seconds respectively. The instant fuzzing rate is 3742 syscall executions per second. However, the average fuzz efficiency dropped to 155 syscall executions per second when the initializing time, waiting time, and other factors were taken into account. We fuzzed each seed application for 24 seconds and, on average, obtained 12.25 crashes within that time frame.

> Pre-trained models of source code have gained widespread popularity in many code intelligence tasks. Recently, with the scaling of the model and corpus size, large language models have shown the ability of in-context learning (ICL). ICL employs task instructions and a few examples as demonstrations, and then inputs the demonstrations to the language models for making predictions. This new learning paradigm is training-free and has shown impressive performance in various natural language processing and code intelligence tasks. However, the performance of ICL heavily relies on the quality of demonstrations, e.g., the selected examples. It is important to systematically investigate how to construct a good demonstration for code-related tasks. In this paper, we empirically explore the impact of three key factors on the performance of ICL in code intelligence tasks: the selection, order, and number of demonstration examples. We conduct extensive experiments on three code intelligence tasks including code summarization, bug fixing, and program synthesis. Our experimental results demonstrate that all the above three factors dramatically impact the performance of ICL in code intelligence tasks. Additionally, we summarize our findings and provide takeaway suggestions on how to construct effective demonstrations, taking into account these three perspectives. We also show that a carefully-designed demonstration based on our findings can lead to substantial improvements over widely-used demonstration construction methods, e.g., improving BLEU-4, EM, and EM by at least 9.90%, 175.96%, and 50.81% on code summarization, bug fixing, and program synthesis, respectively

> Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms are often governed by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which are implemented via governance protocols. Governance tokens are distributed to users of the platform, granting them voting rights in the platform's governance protocol. Many DeFi platforms have already been subject to attacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds.   In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.   We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off. We present evidence of DeFi platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own agenda at the expense of the host platform.

> In recent years, semantic communication has been a popular research topic for its superiority in communication efficiency. As semantic communication relies on deep learning to extract meaning from raw messages, it is vulnerable to attacks targeting deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce the model inversion eavesdropping attack (MIEA) to reveal the risk of privacy leaks in the semantic communication system. In MIEA, the attacker first eavesdrops the signal being transmitted by the semantic communication system and then performs model inversion attack to reconstruct the raw message, where both the white-box and black-box settings are considered. Evaluation results show that MIEA can successfully reconstruct the raw message with good quality under different channel conditions. We then propose a defense method based on random permutation and substitution to defend against MIEA in order to achieve secure semantic communication. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense method in preventing MIEA.

> In recent years, federated learning (FL) has become a very popular paradigm for training distributed, large-scale, and privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) systems. In contrast to standard ML, where data must be collected at the exact location where training is performed, FL takes advantage of the computational capabilities of millions of edge devices to collaboratively train a shared, global model without disclosing their local private data. Specifically, in a typical FL system, the central server acts only as an orchestrator; it iteratively gathers and aggregates all the local models trained by each client on its private data until convergence. Although FL undoubtedly has several benefits over traditional ML (e.g., it protects private data ownership by design), it suffers from several weaknesses. One of the most critical challenges is to overcome the centralized orchestration of the classical FL client-server architecture, which is known to be vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks and man-in-the-middle attacks, among others. To mitigate such exposure, decentralized FL solutions have emerged where all FL clients cooperate and communicate without a central server. This survey comprehensively summarizes and reviews existing decentralized FL approaches proposed in the literature. Furthermore, it identifies emerging challenges and suggests promising research directions in this under-explored domain.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks (Trojans), where an attacker poisons the training set with backdoor triggers so that the neural network learns to classify test-time triggers to the attacker's designated target class. Recent work shows that backdoor poisoning induces over-fitting (abnormally large activations) in the attacked model, which motivates a general, post-training clipping method for backdoor mitigation, i.e., with bounds on internal-layer activations learned using a small set of clean samples. We devise a new such approach, choosing the activation bounds to explicitly limit classification margins. This method gives superior performance against peer methods for CIFAR-10 image classification. We also show that this method has strong robustness against adaptive attacks, X2X attacks, and on different datasets. Finally, we demonstrate a method extension for test-time detection and correction based on the output differences between the original and activation-bounded networks. The code of our method is online available.

> We propose and release a new vulnerable source code dataset. We curate the dataset by crawling security issue websites, extracting vulnerability-fixing commits and source codes from the corresponding projects. Our new dataset contains 18,945 vulnerable functions spanning 150 CWEs and 330,492 non-vulnerable functions extracted from 7,514 commits. Our dataset covers 295 more projects than all previous datasets combined.   Combining our new dataset with previous datasets, we present an analysis of the challenges and promising research directions of using deep learning for detecting software vulnerabilities. We study 11 model architectures belonging to 4 families. Our results show that deep learning is still not ready for vulnerability detection, due to high false positive rate, low F1 score, and difficulty of detecting hard CWEs. In particular, we demonstrate an important generalization challenge for the deployment of deep learning-based models. We show that increasing the volume of training data may not further improve the performance of deep learning models for vulnerability detection, but might be useful to improve the generalization ability to unseen projects.   We also identify hopeful future research directions. We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) are a promising research direction for ML-based vulnerability detection, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with code-structure features in our experiments. Moreover, developing source code specific pre-training objectives is a promising research direction to improve the vulnerability detection performance.

> A significant number of machine learning models are vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which focus on stealing the models by using specially curated queries against the target model. This task is well accomplished by using part of the training data or a surrogate dataset to train a new model that mimics a target model in a white-box environment. In pragmatic situations, however, the target models are trained on private datasets that are inaccessible to the adversary. The data-free model extraction technique replaces this problem when it comes to using queries artificially curated by a generator similar to that used in Generative Adversarial Nets. We propose for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an adversary black box attack extending to a regression problem for predicting bounding box coordinates in object detection. As part of our study, we found that defining a loss function and using a novel generator setup is one of the key aspects in extracting the target model. We find that the proposed model extraction method achieves significant results by using reasonable queries. The discovery of this object detection vulnerability will support future prospects for securing such models.

> The threats posed by evolving cyberattacks have led to increased research related to software systems that can self-protect. One topic in this domain is Moving Target Defense (MTD), which changes software characteristics in the protected system to make it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. However, MTD implementation and deployment are often impacted by run-time uncertainties, and existing MTD decision-making solutions have neglected uncertainty in model parameters and lack self-adaptation. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an approach for an uncertainty-aware and self-adaptive MTD decision engine based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and Bayesian Learning techniques. The proposed approach considers uncertainty in both state and model parameters; thus, it has the potential to better capture environmental variability and improve defense strategies. A preliminary study is presented to highlight the potential effectiveness and challenges of the proposed approach.

> In edge computing environments, app vendors can cache their data to be shared with their users in many geographically distributed edge servers. However, the cached data is particularly vulnerable to several intentional attacks or unintentional events. Given the limited resources of edge servers and prohibitive storage costs incurred by app vendors, designing an efficient approach to inspect and maintain the data over tremendous edge servers is a critical issue. To tackle the problem, we design a novel data inspection approach, named ${\text{O}^2\text{DI}}$, that provides the following services: i) using ${\text{O}^2\text{DI}}$, app vendors can inspect the data cached in edge servers without having the original data, which reduces the incurred I/O and storage overhead significantly; ii) computational operations conducted by both edge servers and app vendors are highly efficient because of a novel online/offline technique; iii) many data files cached in different edge servers can be verified quickly and at once by using a novel batch verification method; iv) corrupted data in edge servers can be localized and repaired efficiently. We analyze the security and performance of ${\text{O}^2\text{DI}}$. We see that it is secure in the random oracle model, much faster, and more cost-effective compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

> NAND flash memory-based IoT devices inherently suffer from data retention issues. In IoT security, these retention issues are significant and require a robust solution for secure deletion. Secure deletion methods can be categorized into off-chip and on-chip schemes. Off-chip secure deletion schemes, based on block-level erasure operations, are unable to perform real-time trim operations. Consequently, they are vulnerable to hacking threats. On the other hand, on-chip secure deletion schemes enable real-time trim operations by performing deletion on a page-by-page basis. However, the on-chip scheme introduces a challenge of program disturbance for neighboring page data. The proposed on-chip deletion scheme tackles this problem by utilizing ECC code modulation through a partial program operation. This approach significantly reduces the program disturbance issue associated with neighboring page data. Moreover, the proposed code modulation secure deletion scheme allows for real-time verification of the deletion of original data.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud recognition are vulnerable to adversarial examples, threatening their practical deployment. Despite the many research endeavors have been made to tackle this issue in recent years, the diversity of adversarial examples on 3D point clouds makes them more challenging to defend against than those on 2D images. For examples, attackers can generate adversarial examples by adding, shifting, or removing points. Consequently, existing defense strategies are hard to counter unseen point cloud adversarial examples. In this paper, we first establish a comprehensive, and rigorous point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark to evaluate adversarial robustness, which can provide a detailed understanding of the effects of the defense and attack methods. We then collect existing defense tricks in point cloud adversarial defenses and then perform extensive and systematic experiments to identify an effective combination of these tricks. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid training augmentation methods that consider various types of point cloud adversarial examples to adversarial training, significantly improving the adversarial robustness. By combining these tricks, we construct a more robust defense framework achieving an average accuracy of 83.45\% against various attacks, demonstrating its capability to enabling robust learners.

> The decentralized and privacy-preserving nature of federated learning (FL) makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks aiming to manipulate the behavior of the resulting model on specific adversary-chosen inputs. However, most existing defenses based on statistical differences take effect only against specific attacks, especially when the malicious gradients are similar to benign ones or the data are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In this paper, we revisit the distance-based defense methods and discover that i) Euclidean distance becomes meaningless in high dimensions and ii) malicious gradients with diverse characteristics cannot be identified by a single metric. To this end, we present a simple yet effective defense strategy with multi-metrics and dynamic weighting to identify backdoors adaptively. Furthermore, our novel defense has no reliance on predefined assumptions over attack settings or data distributions and little impact on benign performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on different datasets under various attack settings, where our method achieves the best defensive performance. For instance, we achieve the lowest backdoor accuracy of 3.06% under the difficult Edge-case PGD, showing significant superiority over previous defenses. The results also demonstrate that our method can be well-adapted to a wide range of non-IID degrees without sacrificing the benign performance.

> Whisper is a recent Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model displaying impressive robustness to both out-of-distribution inputs and random noise. In this work, we show that this robustness does not carry over to adversarial noise. We show that we can degrade Whisper performance dramatically, or even transcribe a target sentence of our choice, by generating very small input perturbations with Signal Noise Ratio of 35-45dB. We also show that by fooling the Whisper language detector we can very easily degrade the performance of multilingual models. These vulnerabilities of a widely popular open-source model have practical security implications and emphasize the need for adversarially robust ASR.

> Tor is an anonymity network used by millions of people every day to evade censorship and protect their browsing activity from privacy threats such as mass surveillance. Unfortunately, Tor has been shown to be vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks, in which an adversary observes the connection between a user and the Tor network and uses features of the encrypted traffic, such as the timing and volume of packets, to identify the websites that are being visited. In response, researchers have proposed a number of defenses against website fingerprinting attacks, and a "circuit padding framework" has been added to the Tor software which supports the implementation of defenses. However, many proposed defenses are not supported by this framework, and no defenses are currently present in Tor.   As Arti, a reimplementation of Tor in Rust, is being developed, the issue arises of whether a new state machine framework should be included or if alternative models should instead be considered for future defense implementation. We address this question by using an improved Rust-based state machine framework, Maybenot, to implement three state-of-the-art website fingerprinting defenses. Through our evaluation, we demonstrate the potential of state machine frameworks to support effective defenses, and we highlight important features that they should contain to do so. However, our evaluation also raises uncertainty about the long-term feasibility of state machine frameworks for defense implementation. We recommend enhancements to Maybenot and substantial further evaluation, along with consideration of alternative designs, before any decision is made regarding a mechanism for implementing website fingerprinting defenses in Arti.

- `2308.06467v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06467v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06467v1)

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained prominence in various applications, such as classification, recognition, and prediction, prompting increased scrutiny of their properties. A fundamental attribute of traditional DNNs is their vulnerability to modifications in input data, which has resulted in the investigation of adversarial attacks. These attacks manipulate the data in order to mislead a DNN. This study aims to challenge the efficacy and generalization of contemporary defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we explore the hypothesis proposed by Ilyas et. al, which posits that DNN image features can be either robust or non-robust, with adversarial attacks targeting the latter. This hypothesis suggests that training a DNN on a dataset consisting solely of robust features should produce a model resistant to adversarial attacks. However, our experiments demonstrate that this is not universally true. To gain further insights into our findings, we analyze the impact of adversarial attack norms on DNN representations, focusing on samples subjected to $L_2$ and $L_{\infty}$ norm attacks. Further, we employ canonical correlation analysis, visualize the representations, and calculate the mean distance between these representations and various DNN decision boundaries. Our results reveal a significant difference between $L_2$ and $L_{\infty}$ norms, which could provide insights into the potential dangers posed by $L_{\infty}$ norm attacks, previously underestimated by the research community.

> Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations, which becomes a severe threat and largely limits their applications in security-critical scenarios. To mitigate such a threat, considerable research efforts have been devoted to increasing the robustness of GCNs against adversarial attacks. However, current defense approaches are typically designed to prevent GCNs from untargeted adversarial attacks and focus on overall performance, making it challenging to protect important local nodes from more powerful targeted adversarial attacks. Additionally, a trade-off between robustness and performance is often made in existing research. Such limitations highlight the need for developing an effective and efficient approach that can defend local nodes against targeted attacks, without compromising the overall performance of GCNs. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method, named Graph Universal Adversarial Defense (GUARD). Unlike previous works, GUARD protects each individual node from attacks with a universal defensive patch, which is generated once and can be applied to any node (node-agnostic) in a graph. GUARD is fast, straightforward to implement without any change to network architecture nor any additional parameters, and is broadly applicable to any GCNs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that GUARD significantly improves robustness for several established GCNs against multiple adversarial attacks and outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods by large margins.

> Grey-box fuzzing is the lightweight approach of choice for finding bugs in sequential programs. It provides a balance between efficiency and effectiveness by conducting a biased random search over the domain of program inputs using a feedback function from observed test executions. For distributed system testing, however, the state-of-practice is represented today by only black-box tools that do not attempt to infer and exploit any knowledge of the system's past behaviours to guide the search for bugs.   In this work, we present Mallory: the first framework for grey-box fuzz-testing of distributed systems. Unlike popular black-box distributed system fuzzers, such as Jepsen, that search for bugs by randomly injecting network partitions and node faults or by following human-defined schedules, Mallory is adaptive. It exercises a novel metric to learn how to maximize the number of observed system behaviors by choosing different sequences of faults, thus increasing the likelihood of finding new bugs. Our approach relies on timeline-driven testing. Mallory dynamically constructs Lamport timelines of the system behaviour and further abstracts these timelines into happens-before summaries, which serve as a feedback function guiding the fuzz campaign. Subsequently, Mallory reactively learns a policy using Q-learning, enabling it to introduce faults guided by its real-time observation of the summaries.   We have evaluated Mallory on a diverse set of widely-used industrial distributed systems. Compared to the start-of-the-art black-box fuzzer Jepsen, Mallory explores more behaviours and takes less time to find bugs. Mallory discovered 22 zero-day bugs (of which 18 were confirmed by developers), including 10 new vulnerabilities, in rigorously-tested distributed systems such as Braft, Dqlite, and Redis. 6 new CVEs have been assigned.

- `2306.03366v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03366v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03366v3)

> The demand for accurate information about the internal structure and characteristics of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) has been on the rise. Recent studies have explored the structure and characteristics of DRAM to improve processing in memory, enhance reliability, and mitigate a vulnerability known as rowhammer. However, DRAM manufacturers only disclose limited information through official documents, making it difficult to find specific information about actual DRAM devices.   This paper presents reliable findings on the internal structure and characteristics of DRAM using activate-induced bitflips (AIBs), retention time test, and row-copy operation. While previous studies have attempted to understand the internal behaviors of DRAM devices, they have only shown results without identifying the causes or have analyzed DRAM modules rather than individual chips. We first uncover the size, structure, and operation of DRAM subarrays and verify our findings on the characteristics of DRAM. Then, we correct misunderstood information related to AIBs and demonstrate experimental results supporting the cause of rowhammer. We expect that the information we uncover about the structure, behavior, and characteristics of DRAM will help future DRAM research.

- *Diyi Liu, Lanmin Liu, Lee D Han*

- `2301.12036v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12036v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12036v2)

> Ramp metering is the act of controlling on-going vehicles to the highway mainlines. Decades of practices of ramp metering have proved that ramp metering can decrease total travel time, mitigate shockwaves, decrease rear-end collisions by smoothing the traffic interweaving process, etc. Besides traditional control algorithm like ALINEA, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been introduced to build a finer control. However, two remaining challenges still hinder DRL from being implemented in the real world: (1) some assumptions of algorithms are hard to be matched in the real world; (2) the rich input states may make the model vulnerable to attacks and data noises. To investigate these issues, we propose a Deep Q-Learning algorithm using only loop detectors information as inputs in this study. Then, a set of False Data Injection attacks and random noise attack are designed to investigate the robustness of the model. The major benefit of the model is that it can be applied to almost any ramp metering sites regardless of the road geometries and layouts. Besides outcompeting the ALINEA method, the Deep Q-Learning method also shows a good robustness through training among very different demands and geometries. For example, during the testing case in I-24 near Murfreesboro, TN, the model shows its robustness as it still outperforms ALINEA algorithm under Fast Gradient Sign Method attacks. Unlike many previous studies, the model is trained and tested in completely different environments to show the capabilities of the model.

- *Changjiang Li, Ren Pang, Zhaohan Xi, Tianyu Du, Shouling Ji, Yuan Yao, Ting Wang*

- `2210.07346v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07346v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07346v2)

> As a new paradigm in machine learning, self-supervised learning (SSL) is capable of learning high-quality representations of complex data without relying on labels. In addition to eliminating the need for labeled data, research has found that SSL improves the adversarial robustness over supervised learning since lacking labels makes it more challenging for adversaries to manipulate model predictions. However, the extent to which this robustness superiority generalizes to other types of attacks remains an open question.   We explore this question in the context of backdoor attacks. Specifically, we design and evaluate CTRL, an embarrassingly simple yet highly effective self-supervised backdoor attack. By only polluting a tiny fraction of training data (<= 1%) with indistinguishable poisoning samples, CTRL causes any trigger-embedded input to be misclassified to the adversary's designated class with a high probability (>= 99%) at inference time. Our findings suggest that SSL and supervised learning are comparably vulnerable to backdoor attacks. More importantly, through the lens of CTRL, we study the inherent vulnerability of SSL to backdoor attacks. With both empirical and analytical evidence, we reveal that the representation invariance property of SSL, which benefits adversarial robustness, may also be the very reason making \ssl highly susceptible to backdoor attacks. Our findings also imply that the existing defenses against supervised backdoor attacks are not easily retrofitted to the unique vulnerability of SSL.

> Securing critical assets in a bus-based System-On-Chip (SoC) is imperative to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access, ensuring the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the system. Ensuring security throughout the SoC design process is a formidable task owing to the inherent intricacies in SoC designs and the dispersion of assets across diverse IPs. Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT (OpenAI) and BARD (Google), have showcased remarkable proficiency across various domains, including security vulnerability detection and prevention in SoC designs. In this work, we propose DIVAS, a novel framework that leverages the knowledge base of LLMs to identify security vulnerabilities from user-defined SoC specifications, map them to the relevant Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), followed by the generation of equivalent assertions, and employ security measures through enforcement of security policies. The proposed framework is implemented using multiple ChatGPT and BARD models, and their performance was analyzed while generating relevant CWEs from the SoC specifications provided. The experimental results obtained from open-source SoC benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework.

- `2308.06973v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06973v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06973v1)

> The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is popular these years due to its various applications. In the UAV network, routing is significantly affected by the distributed network topology, leading to the issue that UAVs are vulnerable to deliberate damage. Hence, this paper focuses on the routing plan and recovery for UAV networks with attacks. In detail, a deliberate attack model based on the importance of nodes is designed to represent enemy attacks. Then, a node importance ranking mechanism is presented, considering the degree of nodes and link importance. However, it is intractable to handle the routing problem by traditional methods for UAV networks, since link connections change with the UAV availability. Hence, an intelligent algorithm based on reinforcement learning is proposed to recover the routing path when UAVs are attacked. Simulations are conducted and numerical results verify the proposed mechanism performs better than other referred methods.

> The quantification of cognitive powers rests on identifying a behavioural task that depends on them. Such dependence cannot be assured, for the powers a task invokes cannot be experimentally controlled or constrained a priori, resulting in unknown vulnerability to failure of specificity and generalisability. Evaluating a compact version of Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM), a widely used clinical test of fluid intelligence, we show that LaMa, a self-supervised artificial neural network trained solely on the completion of partially masked images of natural environmental scenes, achieves human-level test scores a prima vista, without any task-specific inductive bias or training. Compared with cohorts of healthy and focally lesioned participants, LaMa exhibits human-like variation with item difficulty, and produces errors characteristic of right frontal lobe damage under degradation of its ability to integrate global spatial patterns. LaMa's narrow training and limited capacity -- comparable to the nervous system of the fruit fly -- suggest RAPM may be open to computationally simple solutions that need not necessarily invoke abstract reasoning.

> The adoption of cloud computing has brought significant advancements in the operational models of businesses. However, this shift also brings new security challenges by expanding the attack surface. The offered services in cloud computing have various service models. Each cloud service model has a defined responsibility divided based on the stack layers between the service user and their cloud provider. Regardless of its service model, each service is constructed from sub-components and services running on the underlying layers. In this paper, we aim to enable more transparency and visibility by designing an ontology that links the provider's services with the sub-components used to deliver the service. Such breakdown for each cloud service sub-components enables the end user to track the vulnerabilities on the service level or one of its sub-components. Such information can result in a better understanding and management of reported vulnerabilities on the sub-components level and their impact on the offered services by the cloud provider. Our ontology and source code are published as an open-source and accessible via GitHub: \href{https://github.com/mohkharma/cc-ontology}{mohkharma/cc-ontology}

<summary>2023-08-14 20:01:05 - White-Box Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning-Based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification</summary>

- *Jie Ma, Junqing Zhang, Guanxiong Shen, Alan Marshall, Chip-Hong Chang*

- `2308.07433v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07433v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07433v1)

> Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is an emerging technique for the lightweight authentication of wireless Internet of things (IoT) devices. RFFI exploits unique hardware impairments as device identifiers, and deep learning is widely deployed as the feature extractor and classifier for RFFI. However, deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversarial examples are generated by adding perturbation to clean data for causing the classifier to make wrong predictions. Deep learning-based RFFI has been shown to be vulnerable to such attacks, however, there is currently no exploration of effective adversarial attacks against a diversity of RFFI classifiers. In this paper, we report on investigations into white-box attacks (non-targeted and targeted) using two approaches, namely the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and projected gradient descent (PGD). A LoRa testbed was built and real datasets were collected. These adversarial examples have been experimentally demonstrated to be effective against convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRU).

> Adversarial training (AT) is the de facto method for building robust neural networks, but it can be computationally expensive. To mitigate this, fast single-step attacks can be used, but this may lead to catastrophic overfitting (CO). This phenomenon appears when networks gain non-trivial robustness during the first stages of AT, but then reach a breaking point where they become vulnerable in just a few iterations. The mechanisms that lead to this failure mode are still poorly understood. In this work, we study the onset of CO in single-step AT methods through controlled modifications of typical datasets of natural images. In particular, we show that CO can be induced at much smaller $\epsilon$ values than it was observed before just by injecting images with seemingly innocuous features. These features aid non-robust classification but are not enough to achieve robustness on their own. Through extensive experiments we analyze this novel phenomenon and discover that the presence of these easy features induces a learning shortcut that leads to CO. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CO and improve our understanding of the dynamics of AT. The code to reproduce our experiments can be found at https://github.com/gortizji/co_features.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, dictating the imperativeness to test the model's robustness before deployment. Transfer-based attackers craft adversarial examples against surrogate models and transfer them to victim models deployed in the black-box situation. To enhance the adversarial transferability, structure-based attackers adjust the backpropagation path to avoid the attack from overfitting the surrogate model. However, existing structure-based attackers fail to explore the convolution module in CNNs and modify the backpropagation graph heuristically, leading to limited effectiveness. In this paper, we propose backPropagation pAth Search (PAS), solving the aforementioned two problems. We first propose SkipConv to adjust the backpropagation path of convolution by structural reparameterization. To overcome the drawback of heuristically designed backpropagation paths, we further construct a DAG-based search space, utilize one-step approximation for path evaluation and employ Bayesian Optimization to search for the optimal path. We conduct comprehensive experiments in a wide range of transfer settings, showing that PAS improves the attack success rate by a huge margin for both normally trained and defense models.

> Currently, many contexts exist where distributed learning is difficult or otherwise constrained by security and communication limitations. One common domain where this is a consideration is in Healthcare where data is often governed by data-use-ordinances like HIPAA. On the other hand, larger sample sizes and shared data models are necessary to allow models to better generalize on account of the potential for more variability and balancing underrepresented classes. Federated learning is a type of distributed learning model that allows data to be trained in a decentralized manner. This, in turn, addresses data security, privacy, and vulnerability considerations as data itself is not shared across a given learning network nodes. Three main challenges to federated learning include node data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), clients requiring high levels of communication overhead between peers, and there is the heterogeneity of different clients within a network with respect to dataset bias and size. As the field has grown, the notion of fairness in federated learning has also been introduced through novel implementations. Fairness approaches differ from the standard form of federated learning and also have distinct challenges and considerations for the healthcare domain. This paper endeavors to outline the typical lifecycle of fair federated learning in research as well as provide an updated taxonomy to account for the current state of fairness in implementations. Lastly, this paper provides added insight into the implications and challenges of implementing and supporting fairness in federated learning in the healthcare domain.

> As the study of graph neural networks becomes more intensive and comprehensive, their robustness and security have received great research interest. The existing global attack methods treat all nodes in the graph as their attack targets. Although existing methods have achieved excellent results, there is still considerable space for improvement. The key problem is that the current approaches rigidly follow the definition of global attacks. They ignore an important issue, i.e., different nodes have different robustness and are not equally resilient to attacks. From a global attacker's view, we should arrange the attack budget wisely, rather than wasting them on highly robust nodes. To this end, we propose a totally new method named partial graph attack (PGA), which selects the vulnerable nodes as attack targets. First, to select the vulnerable items, we propose a hierarchical target selection policy, which allows attackers to only focus on easy-to-attack nodes. Then, we propose a cost-effective anchor-picking policy to pick the most promising anchors for adding or removing edges, and a more aggressive iterative greedy-based attack method to perform more efficient attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PGA can achieve significant improvements in both attack effect and attack efficiency compared to other existing graph global attack methods.

> Ability to test firmware on embedded devices is critical to discovering vulnerabilities prior to their adversarial exploitation. State-of-the-art automated testing methods rehost firmware in emulators and attempt to facilitate inputs from a diversity of methods (interrupt driven, status polling) and a plethora of devices (such as modems and GPS units). Despite recent progress to tackle peripheral input generation challenges in rehosting, a firmware's expectation of multi-byte magic values supplied from peripheral inputs for string operations still pose a significant roadblock. We solve the impediment posed by multi-byte magic strings in monolithic firmware. We propose feedback mechanisms for input-to-state mapping and retaining seeds for targeted replacement mutations with an efficient method to solve multi-byte comparisons. The feedback allows an efficient search over a combinatorial solution-space. We evaluate our prototype implementation, SplITS, with a diverse set of 21 real-world monolithic firmware binaries used in prior works, and 3 new binaries from popular open source projects. SplITS automatically solves 497% more multi-byte magic strings guarding further execution to uncover new code and bugs compared to state-of-the-art. In 11 of the 12 real-world firmware binaries with string comparisons, including those extensively analyzed by prior works, SplITS outperformed, statistically significantly. We observed up to 161% increase in blocks covered and discovered 6 new bugs that remained guarded by string comparisons. Significantly, deep and difficult to reproduce bugs guarded by comparisons, identified in prior work, were found consistently. To facilitate future research in the field, we release SplITS, the new firmware data sets, and bug analysis at https://github.com/SplITS-Fuzzer

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have found widespread applications in various domains, including web applications, where they facilitate human interaction via chatbots with natural language interfaces. Internally, aided by an LLM-integration middleware such as Langchain, user prompts are translated into SQL queries used by the LLM to provide meaningful responses to users. However, unsanitized user prompts can lead to SQL injection attacks, potentially compromising the security of the database. Despite the growing interest in prompt injection vulnerabilities targeting LLMs, the specific risks of generating SQL injection attacks through prompt injections have not been extensively studied. In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of prompt-to-SQL (P$_2$SQL) injections targeting web applications based on the Langchain framework. Using Langchain as our case study, we characterize P$_2$SQL injections, exploring their variants and impact on application security through multiple concrete examples. Furthermore, we evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating the pervasiveness of P$_2$SQL attacks across language models. Our findings indicate that LLM-integrated applications based on Langchain are highly susceptible to P$_2$SQL injection attacks, warranting the adoption of robust defenses. To counter these attacks, we propose four effective defense techniques that can be integrated as extensions to the Langchain framework. We validate the defenses through an experimental evaluation with a real-world use case application.

> Modern web applications often resort to application development frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Angular. While the frameworks facilitate the development of web applications with several useful components, they are inevitably vulnerable to unmanaged memory consumption since the frameworks often produce Single Page Applications (SPAs). Web applications can be alive for hours and days with behavior loops, in such cases, even a single memory leak in a SPA app can cause performance degradation on the client side. However, recent debugging techniques for web applications still focus on memory leak detection, which requires manual tasks and produces imprecise results.   We propose LeakPair, a technique to repair memory leaks in single page applications. Given the insight that memory leaks are mostly non-functional bugs and fixing them might not change the behavior of an application, the technique is designed to proactively generate patches to fix memory leaks, without leak detection, which is often heavy and tedious. To generate effective patches, LeakPair follows the idea of pattern-based program repair since the automated repair strategy shows successful results in many recent studies. We evaluate the technique on more than 20 open-source projects without using explicit leak detection. The patches generated by our technique are also submitted to the projects as pull requests. The results show that LeakPair can generate effective patches to reduce memory consumption that are acceptable to developers. In addition, we execute the test suites given by the projects after applying the patches, and it turns out that the patches do not cause any functionality breakage; this might imply that LeakPair can generate non-intrusive patches for memory leaks.

> Deploying machine learning (ML) models in the wild is challenging as it suffers from distribution shifts, where the model trained on an original domain cannot generalize well to unforeseen diverse transfer domains. To address this challenge, several test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to improve the generalization ability of the target pre-trained models under test data to cope with the shifted distribution. The success of TTA can be credited to the continuous fine-tuning of the target model according to the distributional hint from the test samples during test time. Despite being powerful, it also opens a new attack surface, i.e., test-time poisoning attacks, which are substantially different from previous poisoning attacks that occur during the training time of ML models (i.e., adversaries cannot intervene in the training process). In this paper, we perform the first test-time poisoning attack against four mainstream TTA methods, including TTT, DUA, TENT, and RPL. Concretely, we generate poisoned samples based on the surrogate models and feed them to the target TTA models. Experimental results show that the TTA methods are generally vulnerable to test-time poisoning attacks. For instance, the adversary can feed as few as 10 poisoned samples to degrade the performance of the target model from 76.20% to 41.83%. Our results demonstrate that TTA algorithms lacking a rigorous security assessment are unsuitable for deployment in real-life scenarios. As such, we advocate for the integration of defenses against test-time poisoning attacks into the design of TTA methods.

> Recently, there has been a surge of interest in integrating vision into Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by Visual Language Models (VLMs) such as Flamingo and GPT-4. This paper sheds light on the security and safety implications of this trend. First, we underscore that the continuous and high-dimensional nature of the visual input makes it a weak link against adversarial attacks, representing an expanded attack surface of vision-integrated LLMs. Second, we highlight that the versatility of LLMs also presents visual attackers with a wider array of achievable adversarial objectives, extending the implications of security failures beyond mere misclassification. As an illustration, we present a case study in which we exploit visual adversarial examples to circumvent the safety guardrail of aligned LLMs with integrated vision. Intriguingly, we discover that a single visual adversarial example can universally jailbreak an aligned LLM, compelling it to heed a wide range of harmful instructions that it otherwise would not) and generate harmful content that transcends the narrow scope of a `few-shot' derogatory corpus initially employed to optimize the adversarial example. Our study underscores the escalating adversarial risks associated with the pursuit of multimodality. Our findings also connect the long-studied adversarial vulnerabilities of neural networks to the nascent field of AI alignment. The presented attack suggests a fundamental adversarial challenge for AI alignment, especially in light of the emerging trend toward multimodality in frontier foundation models.

> A wireless communications system usually consists of a transmitter which transmits the information and a receiver which recovers the original information from the received distorted signal. Deep learning (DL) has been used to improve the performance of the receiver in complicated channel environments and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance has been achieved. However, its robustness has not been investigated. In order to evaluate the robustness of DL-based information recovery models under adversarial circumstances, we investigate adversarial attacks on the SOTA DL-based information recovery model, i.e., DeepReceiver. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem with power and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) constraints. We design different adversarial attack methods according to the adversary's knowledge of DeepReceiver's model and/or testing samples. Extensive experiments show that the DeepReceiver is vulnerable to the designed attack methods in all of the considered scenarios. Even in the scenario of both model and test sample restricted, the adversary can attack the DeepReceiver and increase its bit error rate (BER) above 10%. It can also be found that the DeepReceiver is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations even with very low power and limited PAPR. These results suggest that defense measures should be taken to enhance the robustness of DeepReceiver.

> Malware detectors based on deep learning (DL) have been shown to be susceptible to malware examples that have been deliberately manipulated in order to evade detection, a.k.a. adversarial malware examples. More specifically, it has been show that deep learning detectors are vulnerable to small changes on the input file. Given this vulnerability of deep learning detectors, we propose a practical defense against adversarial malware examples inspired by randomized smoothing. In our work, instead of employing Gaussian or Laplace noise when randomizing inputs, we propose a randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme that ablates a percentage of the bytes within an executable. During training, our randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base classifier based on ablated versions of the executable files. At test time, the final classification for a given input executable is taken as the class most commonly predicted by the classifier on a set of ablated versions of the original executable. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have empirically evaluated the proposed ablation-based model against various state-of-the-art evasion attacks on the BODMAS dataset. Results show greater robustness and generalization capabilities to adversarial malware examples in comparison to a non-smoothed classifier.

> The field of software security testing, more specifically penetration testing, is an activity that requires high levels of expertise and involves many manual testing and analysis steps. This paper explores the potential usage of large-language models, such as GPT3.5, to augment penetration testers with AI sparring partners. We explore the feasibility of supplementing penetration testers with AI models for two distinct use cases: high-level task planning for security testing assignments and low-level vulnerability hunting within a vulnerable virtual machine. For the latter, we implemented a closed-feedback loop between LLM-generated low-level actions with a vulnerable virtual machine (connected through SSH) and allowed the LLM to analyze the machine state for vulnerabilities and suggest concrete attack vectors which were automatically executed within the virtual machine. We discuss promising initial results, detail avenues for improvement, and close deliberating on the ethics of providing AI-based sparring partners.

> The IoT is getting more and more pervasive. Even the simplest devices, such as a light bulb or an electrical plug, are made "smart" and controllable by our smartphone. This paper describes the findings obtained by applying the PETIoT kill chain to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing session on a smart bulb, the Tapo L530E by Tp-Link, currently best seller on Amazon Italy. We found that four vulnerabilities affect the bulb, two of High severity and two of Medium severity according to the CVSS v3.1 scoring system. In short, authentication is not well accounted for and confidentiality is insufficiently achieved by the implemented cryptographic measures. In consequence, an attacker who is nearby the bulb can operate at will not just the bulb but all devices of the Tapo family that the user may have on her Tapo account. Moreover, the attacker can learn the victim's Wi-Fi password, thereby escalating his malicious potential considerably. The paper terminates with an outline of possible fixes.

> In recent years, researchers proposed a variety of deep learning models for wind power forecasting. These models predict the wind power generation of wind farms or entire regions more accurately than traditional machine learning algorithms or physical models. However, latest research has shown that deep learning models can often be manipulated by adversarial attacks. Since wind power forecasts are essential for the stability of modern power systems, it is important to protect them from this threat. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of two different forecasting models to targeted, semi-targeted, and untargeted adversarial attacks. We consider a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting the power generation of individual wind farms and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for forecasting the wind power generation throughout Germany. Moreover, we propose the Total Adversarial Robustness Score (TARS), an evaluation metric for quantifying the robustness of regression models to targeted and semi-targeted adversarial attacks. It assesses the impact of attacks on the model's performance, as well as the extent to which the attacker's goal was achieved, by assigning a score between 0 (very vulnerable) and 1 (very robust). In our experiments, the LSTM forecasting model was fairly robust and achieved a TARS value of over 0.78 for all adversarial attacks investigated. The CNN forecasting model only achieved TARS values below 0.10 when trained ordinarily, and was thus very vulnerable. Yet, its robustness could be significantly improved by adversarial training, which always resulted in a TARS above 0.46.

> Automatic speech recognition (ASR) provides diverse audio-to-text services for humans to communicate with machines. However, recent research reveals ASR systems are vulnerable to various malicious audio attacks. In particular, by removing the non-essential frequency components, a new spectrum reduction attack can generate adversarial audios that can be perceived by humans but cannot be correctly interpreted by ASR systems. It raises a new challenge for content moderation solutions to detect harmful content in audio and video available on social media platforms. In this paper, we propose an acoustic compensation system named ACE to counter the spectrum reduction attacks over ASR systems. Our system design is based on two observations, namely, frequency component dependencies and perturbation sensitivity. First, since the Discrete Fourier Transform computation inevitably introduces spectral leakage and aliasing effects to the audio frequency spectrum, the frequency components with similar frequencies will have a high correlation. Thus, considering the intrinsic dependencies between neighboring frequency components, it is possible to recover more of the original audio by compensating for the removed components based on the remaining ones. Second, since the removed components in the spectrum reduction attacks can be regarded as an inverse of adversarial noise, the attack success rate will decrease when the adversarial audio is replayed in an over-the-air scenario. Hence, we can model the acoustic propagation process to add over-the-air perturbations into the attacked audio. We implement a prototype of ACE and the experiments show ACE can effectively reduce up to 87.9% of ASR inference errors caused by spectrum reduction attacks. Also, by analyzing residual errors, we summarize six general types of ASR inference errors and investigate the error causes and potential mitigation solutions.

> Cloud virtualization technology, ingrained with physical resource sharing, prompts cybersecurity threats on users' virtual machines (VM)s due to the presence of inevitable vulnerabilities on the offsite servers. Contrary to the existing works which concentrated on reducing resource sharing and encryption and decryption of data before transfer for improving cybersecurity which raises computational cost overhead, the proposed model operates diversely for efficiently serving the same purpose. This paper proposes a novel Multiple Risks Analysis based VM Threat Prediction Model (MR-TPM) to secure computational data and minimize adversary breaches by proactively estimating the VMs threats. It considers multiple cybersecurity risk factors associated with the configuration and management of VMs, along with analysis of users' behaviour. All these threat factors are quantified for the generation of respective risk score values and fed as input into a machine learning based classifier to estimate the probability of threat for each VM. The performance of MR-TPM is evaluated using benchmark Google Cluster and OpenNebula VM threat traces. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently computes the cybersecurity risks and learns the VM threat patterns from historical and live data samples. The deployment of MR-TPM with existing VM allocation policies reduces cybersecurity threats up to 88.9%.

> With the rapid evolution of the Internet of Things, many real-world applications utilize heterogeneously connected sensors to capture time-series information. Edge-based machine learning (ML) methodologies are often employed to analyze locally collected data. However, a fundamental issue across data-driven ML approaches is distribution shift. It occurs when a model is deployed on a data distribution different from what it was trained on, and can substantially degrade model performance. Additionally, increasingly sophisticated deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-sensor time series data, requiring intensive computational resources beyond the capacity of today's edge devices. While brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has been introduced as a lightweight solution for edge-based learning, existing HDCs are also vulnerable to the distribution shift challenge. In this paper, we propose DOMINO, a novel HDC learning framework addressing the distribution shift problem in noisy multi-sensor time-series data. DOMINO leverages efficient and parallel matrix operations on high-dimensional space to dynamically identify and filter out domain-variant dimensions. Our evaluation on a wide range of multi-sensor time series classification tasks shows that DOMINO achieves on average 2.04% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNN-based domain generalization techniques, and delivers 16.34x faster training and 2.89x faster inference. More importantly, DOMINO performs notably better when learning from partially labeled and highly imbalanced data, providing 10.93x higher robustness against hardware noises than SOTA DNNs.

> Recently, methods for skeleton-based human activity recognition have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, these attack methods require either the full knowledge of the victim (i.e. white-box attacks), access to training data (i.e. transfer-based attacks) or frequent model queries (i.e. black-box attacks). All their requirements are highly restrictive, raising the question of how detrimental the vulnerability is. In this paper, we show that the vulnerability indeed exists. To this end, we consider a new attack task: the attacker has no access to the victim model or the training data or labels, where we coin the term hard no-box attack. Specifically, we first learn a motion manifold where we define an adversarial loss to compute a new gradient for the attack, named skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient. Our gradient contains information of the motion dynamics, which is different from existing gradient-based attack methods that compute the loss gradient assuming each dimension in the data is independent. The SMI gradient can augment many gradient-based attack methods, leading to a new family of no-box attack methods. Extensive evaluation and comparison show that our method imposes a real threat to existing classifiers. They also show that the SMI gradient improves the transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial samples in both no-box and transfer-based black-box settings.

> Hardware security vulnerabilities in computing systems compromise the security defenses of not only the hardware but also the software running on it. Recent research has shown that hardware fuzzing is a promising technique to efficiently detect such vulnerabilities in large-scale designs such as modern processors. However, the current fuzzing techniques do not adjust their strategies dynamically toward faster and higher design space exploration, resulting in slow vulnerability detection, evident through their low design coverage. To address this problem, we propose PSOFuzz, which uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) to schedule the mutation operators and to generate initial input programs dynamically with the objective of detecting vulnerabilities quickly. Unlike traditional PSO, which finds a single optimal solution, we use a modified PSO that dynamically computes the optimal solution for selecting mutation operators required to explore new design regions in hardware. We also address the challenge of inefficient initial seed generation by employing PSO-based seed generation. Including these optimizations, our final formulation outperforms fuzzers without PSO. Experiments show that PSOFuzz achieves up to 15.25$\times$ speedup for vulnerability detection and up to 2.22$\times$ speedup for coverage compared to the state-of-the-art simulation-based hardware fuzzer.

> The last decade of machine learning has seen drastic increases in scale and capabilities. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in the real world. However, they are difficult to analyze, raising concerns about using them without a rigorous understanding of how they function. Effective tools for interpreting them will be important for building more trustworthy AI by helping to identify problems, fix bugs, and improve basic understanding. In particular, "inner" interpretability techniques, which focus on explaining the internal components of DNNs, are well-suited for developing a mechanistic understanding, guiding manual modifications, and reverse engineering solutions.   Much recent work has focused on DNN interpretability, and rapid progress has thus far made a thorough systematization of methods difficult. In this survey, we review over 300 works with a focus on inner interpretability tools. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies methods by what part of the network they help to explain (weights, neurons, subnetworks, or latent representations) and whether they are implemented during (intrinsic) or after (post hoc) training. To our knowledge, we are also the first to survey a number of connections between interpretability research and work in adversarial robustness, continual learning, modularity, network compression, and studying the human visual system. We discuss key challenges and argue that the status quo in interpretability research is largely unproductive. Finally, we highlight the importance of future work that emphasizes diagnostics, debugging, adversaries, and benchmarking in order to make interpretability tools more useful to engineers in practical applications.

> There has been many papers in academic literature on quantizing weight tensors in deep learning models to reduce inference latency and memory footprint. TVM also has the ability to quantize weights and support low-bit computations. Although quantization is typically expected to improve inference time, in TVM, the performance of 8-bit quantization does not meet the expectations. Typically, when applying 8-bit quantization to a deep learning model, it is usually expected to achieve around 50% of the full-precision inference time. However, in this particular case, not only does the quantized version fail to achieve the desired performance boost, but it actually performs worse, resulting in an inference time that is about 2 times as slow as the non-quantized version. In this project, we thoroughly investigate the reasons behind the underperformance and assess the compatibility and optimization opportunities of 8-bit quantization in TVM. We discuss the optimization of two different types of tasks: computation-bound and memory-bound, and provide a detailed comparison of various optimization techniques in TVM. Through the identification of performance issues, we have successfully improved quantization by addressing a bug in graph building. Furthermore, we analyze multiple optimization strategies to achieve the optimal quantization result. The best experiment achieves 163.88% improvement compared with the TVM compiled baseline in inference time for the compute-bound task and 194.98% for the memory-bound task.

> Machine learning has proven to be a useful tool for automated malware detection, but machine learning models have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This article addresses the problem of generating adversarial malware samples, specifically malicious Windows Portable Executable files. We summarize and compare work that has focused on adversarial machine learning for malware detection. We use gradient-based, evolutionary algorithm-based, and reinforcement-based methods to generate adversarial samples, and then test the generated samples against selected antivirus products. We compare the selected methods in terms of accuracy and practical applicability. The results show that applying optimized modifications to previously detected malware can lead to incorrect classification of the file as benign. It is also known that generated malware samples can be successfully used against detection models other than those used to generate them and that using combinations of generators can create new samples that evade detection. Experiments show that the Gym-malware generator, which uses a reinforcement learning approach, has the greatest practical potential. This generator achieved an average sample generation time of 5.73 seconds and the highest average evasion rate of 44.11%. Using the Gym-malware generator in combination with itself improved the evasion rate to 58.35%.

> Transfer learning is widely used for training deep neural networks (DNN) for building a powerful representation. Even after the pre-trained model is adapted for the target task, the representation performance of the feature extractor is retained to some extent. As the performance of the pre-trained model can be considered the private property of the owner, it is natural to seek the exclusive right of the generalized performance of the pre-trained weight. To address this issue, we suggest a new paradigm of transfer learning called disposable transfer learning (DTL), which disposes of only the source task without degrading the performance of the target task. To achieve knowledge disposal, we propose a novel loss named Gradient Collision loss (GC loss). GC loss selectively unlearns the source knowledge by leading the gradient vectors of mini-batches in different directions. Whether the model successfully unlearns the source task is measured by piggyback learning accuracy (PL accuracy). PL accuracy estimates the vulnerability of knowledge leakage by retraining the scrubbed model on a subset of source data or new downstream data. We demonstrate that GC loss is an effective approach to the DTL problem by showing that the model trained with GC loss retains the performance on the target task with a significantly reduced PL accuracy.

> Researchers are now focusing on 6G as a new network technology that will bring significant gains over the previous generations while many sectors are still implementing the 5G network in their business processes and operations. Meanwhile, key technological fields that will be influenced by 6G networks have been identified. These include distributed artificial intelligence, intelligent radio, real-time intelligent edge computing, and 3D intercoms. Additionally, each area and potential application of 6G is supported by relevant emerging technologies. Nevertheless, these 6G technology and applications have significant security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before the complete adoption of 6G networks. The healthcare is one of the sectors that are benefiting from the great features introduced in the 5G networks that enhance digital communications and data protection; that notwithstanding, there are still security flaws in 5G technologies that can be transferred to the 6G networks if not properly addressed. This paper highlights the key areas of 6G networks that would provide grand support for the development of healthcare systems. It also identifies certain vulnerabilities in the previous cellular networks that are transferable to 6G networks, and suggests security strategies including zero trust initiatives that could be implemented to address the security concerns.

> Code review is a popular practice where developers critique each others' changes. Since automated builds can identify low-level issues (e.g., syntactic errors, regression bugs), it is not uncommon for software organizations to incorporate automated builds in the code review process. In such code review deployment scenarios, submitted change sets must be approved for integration by both peer code reviewers and automated build bots. Since automated builds may produce an unreliable signal of the status of a change set (e.g., due to ``flaky'' or non-deterministic execution behaviour), code review tools, such as Gerrit, allow developers to request a ``recheck'', which repeats the build process without updating the change set. We conjecture that an unconstrained recheck command will waste time and resources if it is not applied judiciously. To explore how the recheck command is applied in a practical setting, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 66,932 code reviews from the OpenStack community.   We quantitatively analyze (i) how often build failures are rechecked; (ii) the extent to which invoking recheck changes build failure outcomes; and (iii) how much waste is generated by invoking recheck. We observe that (i) 55% of code reviews invoke the recheck command after a failing build is reported; (ii) invoking the recheck command only changes the outcome of a failing build in 42% of the cases; and (iii) invoking the recheck command increases review waiting time by an average of 2,200% and equates to 187.4 compute years of waste -- enough compute resources to compete with the oldest land living animal on earth.

> The introduction of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google Palm2 for smart contract generation seems to be the first well-established instance of an AI pair programmer. LLMs have access to a large number of open-source smart contracts, enabling them to utilize more extensive code in Solidity than other code generation tools. Although the initial and informal assessments of LLMs for smart contract generation are promising, a systematic evaluation is needed to explore the limits and benefits of these models. The main objective of this study is to assess the quality of generated code provided by LLMs for smart contracts. We also aim to evaluate the impact of the quality and variety of input parameters fed to LLMs. To achieve this aim, we created an experimental setup for evaluating the generated code in terms of validity, correctness, and efficiency. Our study finds crucial evidence of security bugs getting introduced in the generated smart contracts as well as the overall quality and correctness of the code getting impacted. However, we also identified the areas where it can be improved. The paper also proposes several potential research directions to improve the process, quality and safety of generated smart contract codes.

We investigate the reasons for this phenomenon and discover that the existing data augmentation approach and hard sample mining strategy are incompatible with ViTs-based FR backbone due to the lack of tailored consideration on preserving face structural information and leveraging each local token information. To remedy these problems, this paper proposes a superior FR model called TransFace, which employs a patch-level data augmentation strategy named DPAP and a hard sample mining strategy named EHSM. Specially, DPAP randomly perturbs the amplitude information of dominant patches to expand sample diversity, which effectively alleviates the overfitting problem in ViTs. EHSM utilizes the information entropy in the local tokens to dynamically adjust the importance weight of easy and hard samples during training, leading to a more stable prediction. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TransFace. Code and models are available at https://github.com/DanJun6737/TransFace.

> With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, smart contracts have become a prominent feature in developing decentralized applications. However, these smart contracts are susceptible to vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit, resulting in significant financial losses. In response to this growing concern, various initiatives have emerged. Notably, the SWC vulnerability list played an important role in raising awareness and understanding of smart contract weaknesses. However, the SWC list lacks maintenance and has not been updated with new vulnerabilities since 2020. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Smart Contract Weakness Enumeration (SWE), a comprehensive and practical vulnerability list up until 2023. We collect 273 vulnerability descriptions from 86 top conference papers and journal papers, employing open card sorting techniques to deduplicate and categorize these descriptions. This process results in the identification of 40 common contract weaknesses, which are further classified into 20 sub-research fields through thorough discussion and analysis. SWE provides a systematic and comprehensive list of smart contract vulnerabilities, covering existing and emerging vulnerabilities in the last few years. Moreover, SWE is a scalable, continuously iterative program. We propose two update mechanisms for the maintenance of SWE. Regular updates involve the inclusion of new vulnerabilities from future top papers, while irregular updates enable individuals to report new weaknesses for review and potential addition to SWE.

> In this study, we evaluated the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly OpenAI's GPT-4, in detecting software vulnerabilities, comparing their performance against traditional static code analyzers like Snyk and Fortify. Our analysis covered numerous repositories, including those from NASA and the Department of Defense. GPT-4 identified approximately four times the vulnerabilities than its counterparts. Furthermore, it provided viable fixes for each vulnerability, demonstrating a low rate of false positives. Our tests encompassed 129 code samples across eight programming languages, revealing the highest vulnerabilities in PHP and JavaScript. GPT-4's code corrections led to a 90% reduction in vulnerabilities, requiring only an 11% increase in code lines. A critical insight was LLMs' ability to self-audit, suggesting fixes for their identified vulnerabilities and underscoring their precision. Future research should explore system-level vulnerabilities and integrate multiple static code analyzers for a holistic perspective on LLMs' potential.

> Memory-safety issues and information leakage are known to be depressingly common. We consider the compositional static detection of these kinds of vulnerabilities in first-order C-like programs. Indeed the latter are relational hyper-safety violations, comparing pairs of program executions, making them more challenging to detect than the former, which require reasoning only over individual executions. Existing symbolic leakage detection methods treat only non-interactive programs, avoiding the challenges of nondeterminism. Also, being whole-program analyses they cannot be applied one-function-at-a-time, thereby ruling out incremental analysis. We remedy these shortcomings by presenting Insecurity Separation Logic (InsecSL), an under-approximate relational program logic for soundly detecting information leakage and memory-safety issues in interactive programs. Importantly, InsecSL reasons about pairs of executions, and so is relational, but purposefully resembles the non-relational Incorrectness Separation Logic (ISL) that is already automated in the Infer tool. We show how InsecSL can be automated by bi-abduction based symbolic execution, and we evaluate two implementations of this idea (one based on Infer) on various case-studies.

> The assessment of cybersecurity Capture-The-Flag (CTF) exercises involves participants finding text strings or ``flags'' by exploiting system vulnerabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs) are natural-language models trained on vast amounts of words to understand and generate text; they can perform well on many CTF challenges. Such LLMs are freely available to students. In the context of CTF exercises in the classroom, this raises concerns about academic integrity. Educators must understand LLMs' capabilities to modify their teaching to accommodate generative AI assistance. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs, particularly in the realm of CTF challenges and questions. Here we evaluate three popular LLMs, OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing. First, we assess the LLMs' question-answering performance on five Cisco certifications with varying difficulty levels. Next, we qualitatively study the LLMs' abilities in solving CTF challenges to understand their limitations. We report on the experience of using the LLMs for seven test cases in all five types of CTF challenges. In addition, we demonstrate how jailbreak prompts can bypass and break LLMs' ethical safeguards. The paper concludes by discussing LLM's impact on CTF exercises and its implications.

> Automated code vulnerability detection has gained increasing attention in recent years. The deep learning (DL)-based methods, which implicitly learn vulnerable code patterns, have proven effective in vulnerability detection. The performance of DL-based methods usually relies on the quantity and quality of labeled data. However, the current labeled data are generally automatically collected, such as crawled from human-generated commits, making it hard to ensure the quality of the labels. Prior studies have demonstrated that the non-vulnerable code (i.e., negative labels) tends to be unreliable in commonly-used datasets, while vulnerable code (i.e., positive labels) is more determined. Considering the large numbers of unlabeled data in practice, it is necessary and worth exploring to leverage the positive data and large numbers of unlabeled data for more accurate vulnerability detection.   In this paper, we focus on the Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning problem for vulnerability detection and propose a novel model named PILOT, i.e., PositIve and unlabeled Learning mOdel for vulnerability deTection. PILOT only learns from positive and unlabeled data for vulnerability detection. It mainly contains two modules: (1) A distance-aware label selection module, aiming at generating pseudo-labels for selected unlabeled data, which involves the inter-class distance prototype and progressive fine-tuning; (2) A mixed-supervision representation learning module to further alleviate the influence of noise and enhance the discrimination of representations.

> It is not an exaggeration to say that the recent progress in artificial intelligence technology depends on large-scale and high-quality data. Simultaneously, a prevalent issue exists everywhere: the budget for data labeling is constrained. Active learning is a prominent approach for addressing this issue, where valuable data for labeling is selected through a model and utilized to iteratively adjust the model. However, due to the limited amount of data in each iteration, the model is vulnerable to bias; thus, it is more likely to yield overconfident predictions. In this paper, we present two novel methods to address the problem of overconfidence that arises in the active learning scenario. The first is an augmentation strategy named Cross-Mix-and-Mix (CMaM), which aims to calibrate the model by expanding the limited training distribution. The second is a selection strategy named Ranked Margin Sampling (RankedMS), which prevents choosing data that leads to overly confident predictions. Through various experiments and analyses, we are able to demonstrate that our proposals facilitate efficient data selection by alleviating overconfidence, even though they are readily applicable.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by applying human-imperceptible perturbations on clean inputs. Although many attack methods can achieve high success rates in the white-box setting, they also exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting. Recently, various methods have been proposed to improve adversarial transferability, in which the input transformation is one of the most effective methods. In this work, we notice that existing input transformation-based works mainly adopt the transformed data in the same domain for augmentation. Inspired by domain generalization, we aim to further improve the transferability using the data augmented from different domains. Specifically, a style transfer network can alter the distribution of low-level visual features in an image while preserving semantic content for humans. Hence, we propose a novel attack method named Style Transfer Method (STM) that utilizes a proposed arbitrary style transfer network to transform the images into different domains. To avoid inconsistent semantic information of stylized images for the classification network, we fine-tune the style transfer network and mix up the generated images added by random noise with the original images to maintain semantic consistency and boost input diversity. Extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-compatible dataset show that our proposed method can significantly improve the adversarial transferability on either normally trained models or adversarially trained models than state-of-the-art input transformation-based attacks.

> Blockchains require deterministic execution in order to reach consensus. This is often guaranteed in languages designed to write smart contracts, such as Solidity. Application-specific blockchains or ``appchains'' allow the blockchain application logic to be written using general-purpose programming languages, giving developers more flexibility but also additional responsibilities. In particular, developers must ensure that their blockchain application logic does not contain any sources of non-determinism. Any source of non-determinism may be a potential source of vulnerabilities.   This paper focuses on the use of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to detect such sources of non-determinism at development time. We focus on Cosmos, a prominent open-source project that lets developers build interconnected networks of application-specific blockchains. Cosmos provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows these chains to be implemented in the Go programming language. We create a corpus of 11 representative Cosmos-based appchains to analyze for sources of non-determinism in Go.   As part of our study, we identified cosmos-sdk-codeql, a set of CodeQL code analysis rules for Cosmos applications. We find that these rules generate many false positives and propose a refactored set of rules that more precisely detects sources of non-determinism only in code that runs as part of the blockchain logic. We demonstrate a significant increase in the precision of the rules, making the SAST tool more effective and hence potentially contributing to enhanced security for Cosmos-based blockchains.

> For vehicular metaverses, one of the ultimate user-centric goals is to optimize the immersive experience and Quality of Service (QoS) for users on board. Semantic Communication (SemCom) has been introduced as a revolutionary paradigm that significantly eases communication resource pressure for vehicular metaverse applications to achieve this goal. SemCom enables high-quality and ultra-efficient vehicular communication, even with explosively increasing data traffic among vehicles. In this article, we propose a hierarchical SemCom-enabled vehicular metaverses framework consisting of the global metaverse, local metaverses, SemCom module, and resource pool. The global and local metaverses are brand-new concepts from the metaverse's distribution standpoint. Considering the QoS of users, this article explores the potential security vulnerabilities of the proposed framework. To that purpose, this study highlights a specific security risk to the framework's SemCom module and offers a viable defense solution, so encouraging community researchers to focus more on vehicular metaverse security. Finally, we provide an overview of the open issues of secure SemCom in the vehicular metaverses, notably pointing out potential future research directions.

> Embedded Network Stacks (ENS) enable low-resource devices to communicate with the outside world, facilitating the development of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. Some defects in ENS are thus high-severity cybersecurity vulnerabilities: they are remotely triggerable and can impact the physical world. While prior research has shed light on the characteristics of defects in many classes of software systems, no study has described the properties of ENS defects nor identified a systematic technique to expose them. The most common automated approach to detecting ENS defects is feedback-driven randomized dynamic analysis ("fuzzing"), a costly and unpredictable technique.   This paper provides the first systematic characterization of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in ENS. We analyzed 61 vulnerabilities across 6 open-source ENS. Most of these ENS defects are concentrated in the transport and network layers of the network stack, require reaching different states in the network protocol, and can be triggered by only 1-2 modifications to a single packet. We therefore propose a novel systematic testing framework that focuses on the transport and network layers, uses seeds that cover a network protocol's states, and systematically modifies packet fields. We evaluated this framework on 4 ENS and replicated 12 of the 14 reported IP/TCP/UDP vulnerabilities. On recent versions of these ENSs, it discovered 7 novel defects (6 assigned CVES) during a bounded systematic test that covered all protocol states and made up to 3 modifications per packet. We found defects in 3 of the 4 ENS we tested that had not been found by prior fuzzing research. Our results suggest that fuzzing should be deferred until after systematic testing is employed.

> System-on-Chips (SoCs) form the crux of modern computing systems. SoCs enable high-level integration through the utilization of multiple Intellectual Property (IP) cores. However, the integration of multiple IP cores also presents unique challenges owing to their inherent vulnerabilities, thereby compromising the security of the entire system. Hence, it is imperative to perform hardware security validation to address these concerns. The efficiency of this validation procedure is contingent on the quality of the SoC security properties provided. However, generating security properties with traditional approaches often requires expert intervention and is limited to a few IPs, thereby resulting in a time-consuming and non-robust process. To address this issue, we, for the first time, propose a novel and automated Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based Security Property Generator (NSPG). Specifically, our approach utilizes hardware documentation in order to propose the first hardware security-specific language model, HS-BERT, for extracting security properties dedicated to hardware design. To evaluate our proposed technique, we trained the HS-BERT model using sentences from RISC-V, OpenRISC, MIPS, OpenSPARC, and OpenTitan SoC documentation. When assessedb on five untrained OpenTitan hardware IP documents, NSPG was able to extract 326 security properties from 1723 sentences. This, in turn, aided in identifying eight security bugs in the OpenTitan SoC design presented in the hardware hacking competition, Hack@DAC 2022.

> Though many deep learning (DL)-based vulnerability detection approaches have been proposed and indeed achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in the generalization as well as the practical usage. More precisely, existing DL-based approaches (1) perform negatively on prediction tasks among functions that are lexically similar but have contrary semantics; (2) provide no intuitive developer-oriented explanations to the detected results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named SVulD, a function-level Subtle semantic embedding for Vulnerability Detection along with intuitive explanations, to alleviate the above limitations. Specifically, SVulD firstly trains a model to learn distinguishing semantic representations of functions regardless of their lexical similarity. Then, for the detected vulnerable functions, SVulD provides natural language explanations (e.g., root cause) of results to help developers intuitively understand the vulnerabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of SVulD, we conduct large-scale experiments on a widely used practical vulnerability dataset and compare it with four state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by considering five performance measures. The experimental results indicate that SVulD outperforms all SOTAs with a substantial improvement (i.e., 23.5%-68.0% in terms of F1-score, 15.9%-134.8% in terms of PR-AUC and 7.4%-64.4% in terms of Accuracy). Besides, we conduct a user-case study to evaluate the usefulness of SVulD for developers on understanding the vulnerable code and the participants' feedback demonstrates that SVulD is helpful for development practice.

> As a distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) enables large-scale clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. However, due to the lack of data auditing for untrusted clients, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, especially backdoor attacks. By using poisoned data for local training or directly changing the model parameters, attackers can easily inject backdoors into the model, which can trigger the model to make misclassification of targeted patterns in images. To address these issues, we propose a novel data-free trigger-generation-based defense approach based on the two characteristics of backdoor attacks: i) triggers are learned faster than normal knowledge, and ii) trigger patterns have a greater effect on image classification than normal class patterns. Our approach generates the images with newly learned knowledge by identifying the differences between the old and new global models, and filters trigger images by evaluating the effect of these generated images. By using these trigger images, our approach eliminates poisoned models to ensure the updated global model is benign. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can defend against almost all the existing types of backdoor attacks and outperform all the seven state-of-the-art defense methods with both IID and non-IID scenarios. Especially, our approach can successfully defend against the backdoor attack even when 80\% of the clients are malicious.

> Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach enabling multiple clients to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) collaboratively without sharing their local training data. However, FL is susceptible to backdoor (or targeted poisoning) attacks. These attacks are initiated by malicious clients who seek to compromise the learning process by introducing specific behaviors into the learned model that can be triggered by carefully crafted inputs. Existing FL safeguards have various limitations: They are restricted to specific data distributions or reduce the global model accuracy due to excluding benign models or adding noise, are vulnerable to adaptive defense-aware adversaries, or require the server to access local models, allowing data inference attacks.   This paper presents a novel defense mechanism, CrowdGuard, that effectively mitigates backdoor attacks in FL and overcomes the deficiencies of existing techniques. It leverages clients' feedback on individual models, analyzes the behavior of neurons in hidden layers, and eliminates poisoned models through an iterative pruning scheme. CrowdGuard employs a server-located stacked clustering scheme to enhance its resilience to rogue client feedback. The evaluation results demonstrate that CrowdGuard achieves a 100% True-Positive-Rate and True-Negative-Rate across various scenarios, including IID and non-IID data distributions. Additionally, CrowdGuard withstands adaptive adversaries while preserving the original performance of protected models. To ensure confidentiality, CrowdGuard uses a secure and privacy-preserving architecture leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on both client and server sides.

> The volume, variety, and velocity of change in vulnerabilities and exploits have made incident threat analysis challenging with human expertise and experience along. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) are to describe how and why attackers exploit vulnerabilities. However, a TTP description written by one security professional can be interpreted very differently by another, leading to confusion in cybersecurity operations or even business, policy, and legal decisions. Meanwhile, advancements in AI have led to the increasing use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to assist the various tasks in cyber operations. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP tasks have significantly improved because of the LLM's semantic understanding and scalability. This leads us to question how well LLMs can interpret TTPs or general cyberattack descriptions to inform analysts of the intended purposes of cyberattacks. We propose to analyze and compare the direct use of LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) versus supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of small-scale-LLMs (e.g., BERT) to study their capabilities in predicting ATT&CK tactics. Our results reveal that the small-scale-LLMs with SFT provide a more focused and clearer differentiation between the ATT&CK tactics (if such differentiation exists). On the other hand, direct use of LLMs offer a broader interpretation of cyberattack techniques. When treating more general cases, despite the power of LLMs, inherent ambiguity exists and limits their predictive power. We then summarize the challenges and recommend research directions on LLMs to treat the inherent ambiguity of TTP descriptions used in various cyber operations.

> Malicious domain detection (MDD) is an open security challenge that aims to detect if an Internet domain is associated with cyber-attacks. Among many approaches to this problem, graph neural networks (GNNs) are deemed highly effective. GNN-based MDD uses DNS logs to represent Internet domains as nodes in a maliciousness graph (DMG) and trains a GNN to infer their maliciousness by leveraging identified malicious domains. Since this method relies on accessible DNS logs to construct DMGs, it exposes a vulnerability for adversaries to manipulate their domain nodes' features and connections within DMGs. Existing research mainly concentrates on threat models that manipulate individual attacker nodes. However, adversaries commonly generate multiple domains to achieve their goals economically and avoid detection. Their objective is to evade discovery across as many domains as feasible. In this work, we call the attack that manipulates several nodes in the DMG concurrently a multi-instance evasion attack. We present theoretical and empirical evidence that the existing single-instance evasion techniques for are inadequate to launch multi-instance evasion attacks against GNN-based MDDs. Therefore, we introduce MintA, an inference-time multi-instance adversarial attack on GNN-based MDDs. MintA enhances node and neighborhood evasiveness through optimized perturbations and operates successfully with only black-box access to the target model, eliminating the need for knowledge about the model's specifics or non-adversary nodes. We formulate an optimization challenge for MintA, achieving an approximate solution. Evaluating MintA on a leading GNN-based MDD technique with real-world data showcases an attack success rate exceeding 80%. These findings act as a warning for security experts, underscoring GNN-based MDDs' susceptibility to practical attacks that can undermine their effectiveness and benefits.

> Machine Learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly those from query-based black-box attacks. Despite various efforts to detect and prevent such attacks, there is a need for a more comprehensive approach to logging, analyzing, and sharing evidence of attacks. While classic security benefits from well-established forensics and intelligence sharing, Machine Learning is yet to find a way to profile its attackers and share information about them. In response, this paper introduces SEA, a novel ML security system to characterize black-box attacks on ML systems for forensic purposes and to facilitate human-explainable intelligence sharing. SEA leverages the Hidden Markov Models framework to attribute the observed query sequence to known attacks. It thus understands the attack's progression rather than just focusing on the final adversarial examples. Our evaluations reveal that SEA is effective at attack attribution, even on their second occurrence, and is robust to adaptive strategies designed to evade forensics analysis. Interestingly, SEA's explanations of the attack behavior allow us even to fingerprint specific minor implementation bugs in attack libraries. For example, we discover that the SignOPT and Square attacks implementation in ART v1.14 sends over 50% specific zero difference queries. We thoroughly evaluate SEA on a variety of settings and demonstrate that it can recognize the same attack's second occurrence with 90+% Top-1 and 95+% Top-3 accuracy.

> Timing attacks are considered one of the most damaging side-channel attacks. These attacks exploit timing fluctuations caused by certain operations to disclose confidential information to an attacker. For instance, in asymmetric encryption, operations such as multiplication and division can cause time-varying execution times that can be ill-treated to obtain an encryption key. Whilst several efforts have been devoted to exploring the various aspects of timing attacks, particularly in cryptography, little attention has been paid to empirically studying the timing attack-related vulnerabilities in non-cryptographic software. By inspecting these software vulnerabilities, this study aims to gain an evidence-based understanding of weaknesses in non-cryptographic software that may help timing attacks succeed. We used qualitative and quantitative research approaches to systematically study the timing attack-related vulnerabilities reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) from March 2003 to December 2022. Our analysis was focused on the modifications made to the code for patching the identified vulnerabilities. We found that a majority of the timing attack-related vulnerabilities were introduced due to not following known secure coding practices. The findings of this study are expected to help the software security community gain evidence-based information about the nature and causes of the vulnerabilities related to timing attacks.

> It is becoming increasingly important to understand the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. One of the fundamental problems in adversarial machine learning is to quantify how much training data is needed in the presence of evasion attacks, where data is corrupted at test time. In this thesis, we work with the exact-in-the-ball notion of robustness and study the feasibility of adversarially robust learning from the perspective of learning theory, considering sample complexity.   We first explore the setting where the learner has access to random examples only, and show that distributional assumptions are essential. We then focus on learning problems with distributions on the input data that satisfy a Lipschitz condition and show that robustly learning monotone conjunctions has sample complexity at least exponential in the adversary's budget (the maximum number of bits it can perturb on each input). However, if the adversary is restricted to perturbing $O(\log n)$ bits, then one can robustly learn conjunctions and decision lists w.r.t. log-Lipschitz distributions.   We then study learning models where the learner is given more power. We first consider local membership queries, where the learner can query the label of points near the training sample. We show that, under the uniform distribution, the exponential dependence on the adversary's budget to robustly learn conjunctions remains inevitable. We then introduce a local equivalence query oracle, which returns whether the hypothesis and target concept agree in a given region around a point in the training sample, and a counterexample if it exists. We show that if the query radius is equal to the adversary's budget, we can develop robust empirical risk minimization algorithms in the distribution-free setting. We give general query complexity upper and lower bounds, as well as for concrete concept classes.

> Offensive security-tests are a common way to pro-actively discover potential vulnerabilities. They are performed by specialists, often called penetration-testers or white-hat hackers. The chronic lack of available white-hat hackers prevents sufficient security test coverage of software. Research into automation tries to alleviate this problem by improving the efficiency of security testing. To achieve this, researchers and tool builders need a solid understanding of how hackers work, their assumptions, and pain points.   In this paper, we present a first data-driven exploratory qualitative study of twelve security professionals, their work and problems occurring therein. We perform a thematic analysis to gain insights into the execution of security assignments, hackers' thought processes and encountered challenges.   This analysis allows us to conclude with recommendations for researchers and tool builders to increase the efficiency of their automation and identify novel areas for research.

> The Internet of Things (IoT) market is rapidly growing and is expected to double from 2020 to 2025. The increasing use of IoT devices, particularly in smart homes, raises crucial concerns about user privacy and security as these devices often handle sensitive and critical information. Inadequate security designs and implementations by IoT vendors can lead to significant vulnerabilities.   To address these IoT device vulnerabilities, institutions, and organizations have published IoT security best practices (BPs) to guide manufacturers in ensuring the security of their products. However, there is currently no standardized approach for evaluating the effectiveness of individual BP recommendations. This leads to manufacturers investing effort in implementing less effective BPs while potentially neglecting measures with greater impact.   In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating the security impact of IoT BPs and ranking them based on their effectiveness in protecting against security threats. Our approach involves translating identified BPs into concrete test cases that can be applied to real-world IoT devices to assess their effectiveness in mitigating vulnerabilities. We applied this methodology to evaluate the security impact of nine commodity IoT products, discovering 18 vulnerabilities. By empirically assessing the actual impact of BPs on device security, IoT designers and implementers can prioritize their security investments more effectively, improving security outcomes and optimizing limited security budgets.

- *Yuxi Mi, Yiheng Sun, Jihong Guan, Shuigeng Zhou*

> Federated learning has seen increased adoption in recent years in response to the growing regulatory demand for data privacy. However, the opaque local training process of federated learning also sparks rising concerns about model faithfulness. For instance, studies have revealed that federated learning is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, whereby a compromised participant can stealthily modify the model's behavior in the presence of backdoor triggers. This paper proposes an effective defense against the attack by examining shared model updates. We begin with the observation that the embedding of backdoors influences the participants' local model weights in terms of the magnitude and orientation of their model gradients, which can manifest as distinguishable disparities. We enable a robust identification of backdoors by studying the statistical distribution of the models' subsets of gradients. Concretely, we first segment the model gradients into fragment vectors that represent small portions of model parameters. We then employ anomaly detection to locate the distributionally skewed fragments and prune the participants with the most outliers. We embody the findings in a novel defense method, ARIBA. We demonstrate through extensive analyses that our proposed methods effectively mitigate state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with minimal impact on task utility.

> Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars each year and take up ~50% of the development time. Once a bug is reported, the assigned developer attempts to identify and understand the source code responsible for the bug and then corrects the code. Over the last five decades, there has been significant research on automatically finding or correcting software bugs. However, there has been little research on automatically explaining the bugs to the developers, which is essential but a highly challenging task. In this paper, we propose Bugsplainer, a novel web-based debugging solution that generates natural language explanations for software bugs by learning from a large corpus of bug-fix commits. Bugsplainer leverages code structures to reason about a bug and employs the fine-tuned version of a text generation model, CodeT5, to generate the explanations.

> Cyber-security vulnerabilities are usually published in form of short natural language descriptions (e.g., in form of MITRE's CVE list) that over time are further manually enriched with labels such as those defined by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In the Vulnerability AI (Analytics and Intelligence) project, we investigated different types of semantic vulnerability embeddings based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques to obtain a concise representation of the vulnerability space. We also evaluated their use as a foundation for machine learning applications that can support cyber-security researchers and analysts in risk assessment and other related activities. The particular applications we explored and briefly summarize in this report are clustering, classification, and visualization, as well as a new logic-based approach to evaluate theories about the vulnerability space.

> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently become a popular data augmentation technique used by machine learning practitioners. However, they have been shown to suffer from the so-called mode collapse failure mode, which makes them vulnerable to exacerbating biases on already skewed datasets, resulting in the generated data distribution being less diverse than the training distribution. To this end, we address the problem of quantifying the extent to which mode collapse occurs. This study is a systematic effort focused on the evaluation of state-of-the-art metrics that can potentially quantify biases in GAN-augmented data. We show that, while several such methods are available, there is no single metric that quantifies bias exacerbation reliably over the span of different image domains.

> Package managers such as NPM have become essential for software development. The NPM repository hosts over 2 million packages and serves over 43 billion downloads every week. Unfortunately, the NPM dependency solver has several shortcomings. 1) NPM is greedy and often fails to install the newest versions of dependencies; 2) NPM's algorithm leads to duplicated dependencies and bloated code, which is particularly bad for web applications that need to minimize code size; 3) NPM's vulnerability fixing algorithm is also greedy, and can even introduce new vulnerabilities; and 4) NPM's ability to duplicate dependencies can break stateful frameworks and requires a lot of care to workaround. Although existing tools try to address these problems they are either brittle, rely on post hoc changes to the dependency tree, do not guarantee optimality, or are not composable.   We present PacSolve, a unifying framework and implementation for dependency solving which allows for customizable constraints and optimization goals. We use PacSolve to build MaxNPM, a complete, drop-in replacement for NPM, which empowers developers to combine multiple objectives when installing dependencies. We evaluate MaxNPM with a large sample of packages from the NPM ecosystem and show that it can: 1) reduce more vulnerabilities in dependencies than NPM's auditing tool in 33% of cases; 2) chooses newer dependencies than NPM in 14% of cases; and 3) chooses fewer dependencies than NPM in 21% of cases. All our code and data is open and available.

> The future of automated driving (AD) is rooted in the development of robust, fair and explainable artificial intelligence methods. Upon request, automated vehicles must be able to explain their decisions to the driver and the car passengers, to the pedestrians and other vulnerable road users and potentially to external auditors in case of accidents. However, nowadays, most explainable methods still rely on quantitative analysis of the AD scene representations captured by multiple sensors. This paper proposes a novel representation of AD scenes, called Qualitative eXplainable Graph (QXG), dedicated to qualitative spatiotemporal reasoning of long-term scenes. The construction of this graph exploits the recent Qualitative Constraint Acquisition paradigm. Our experimental results on NuScenes, an open real-world multi-modal dataset, show that the qualitative eXplainable graph of an AD scene composed of 40 frames can be computed in real-time and light in space storage which makes it a potentially interesting tool for improved and more trustworthy perception and control processes in AD.

> Enlightened by the big success of pre-training in natural language processing, pre-trained models for programming languages have been widely used to promote code intelligence in recent years. In particular, BERT has been used for bug localization tasks and impressive results have been obtained. However, these BERT-based bug localization techniques suffer from two issues. First, the pre-trained BERT model on source code does not adequately capture the deep semantics of program code. Second, the overall bug localization models neglect the necessity of large-scale negative samples in contrastive learning for representations of changesets and ignore the lexical similarity between bug reports and changesets during similarity estimation. We address these two issues by 1) proposing a novel directed, multiple-label code graph representation named Semantic Flow Graph (SFG), which compactly and adequately captures code semantics, 2) designing and training SemanticCodeBERT based on SFG, and 3) designing a novel Hierarchical Momentum Contrastive Bug Localization technique (HMCBL). Evaluation results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in bug localization.

> Writing logging messages is a well-established conventional programming practice, and it is of vital importance for a wide variety of software development activities. The logging mechanism in Solidity programming is enabled by the high-level event feature, but up to now there lacks study for understanding Solidity event logging practices in the wild. To fill this gap, we in this paper provide the first quantitative characteristic study of the current Solidity event logging practices using 2,915 popular Solidity projects hosted on GitHub. The study methodically explores the pervasiveness of event logging, the goodness of current event logging practices, and in particular the reasons for event logging code evolution, and delivers 8 original and important findings. The findings notably include the existence of a large percentage of independent event logging code modifications, and the underlying reasons for different categories of independent event logging code modifications are diverse (for instance, bug fixing and gas saving). We additionally give the implications of our findings, and these implications can enlighten developers, researchers, tool builders, and language designers to improve the event logging practices. To illustrate the potential benefits of our study, we develop a proof-of-concept checker on top of one of our findings and the checker effectively detects problematic event logging code that consumes extra gas in 35 popular GitHub projects and 9 project owners have already confirmed the detected issues.

> Spurred by the recent rapid increase in the development and distribution of large language models (LLMs) across industry and academia, much recent work has drawn attention to safety- and security-related threats and vulnerabilities of LLMs, including in the context of potentially criminal activities. Specifically, it has been shown that LLMs can be misused for fraud, impersonation, and the generation of malware; while other authors have considered the more general problem of AI alignment. It is important that developers and practitioners alike are aware of security-related problems with such models. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing - predominantly scientific - efforts on identifying and mitigating threats and vulnerabilities arising from LLMs. We present a taxonomy describing the relationship between threats caused by the generative capabilities of LLMs, prevention measures intended to address such threats, and vulnerabilities arising from imperfect prevention measures. With our work, we hope to raise awareness of the limitations of LLMs in light of such security concerns, among both experienced developers and novel users of such technologies.

> Security critical software, e.g., OpenSSL, comes with numerous side-channel leakages left unpatched due to a lack of resources or experts. The situation will only worsen as the pace of code development accelerates, with developers relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate code. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs in generating patches for vulnerable code with microarchitectural side-channel leakages. For this, we investigate the generative abilities of powerful LLMs by carefully crafting prompts following a zero-shot learning approach. All generated code is dynamically analyzed by leakage detection tools, which are capable of pinpointing information leakage at the instruction level leaked either from secret dependent accesses or branches or vulnerable Spectre gadgets, respectively. Carefully crafted prompts are used to generate candidate replacements for vulnerable code, which are then analyzed for correctness and for leakage resilience. From a cost/performance perspective, the GPT4-based configuration costs in API calls a mere few cents per vulnerability fixed. Our results show that LLM-based patching is far more cost-effective and thus provides a scalable solution. Finally, the framework we propose will improve in time, especially as vulnerability detection tools and LLMs mature.

> Various approaches are proposed to help under-resourced security researchers to detect and analyze software vulnerabilities. It is still incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive for security researchers to fix vulnerabilities. The time lag between reporting and fixing a vulnerability causes software systems to suffer from significant exposure to possible attacks. Recently, some techniques have proposed applying pre-trained models to fix security vulnerabilities and have proved their success in improving repair accuracy. However, the effectiveness of existing pre-trained models has not been systematically analyzed, and little is known about their advantages and disadvantages.   To bridge this gap, we perform the first extensive study on applying various pre-trained models to vulnerability repair. The results show that studied pre-trained models consistently outperform the state-of-the-art technique VRepair with a prediction accuracy of 32.94%~44.96%. We also investigate the impact of major phases in the vulnerability repair workflow. Surprisingly, a simplistic approach adopting transfer learning improves the prediction accuracy of pre-trained models by 9.40% on average. Besides, we provide additional discussion to illustrate the capacity and limitations of pre-trained models. Finally, we further pinpoint various practical guidelines for advancing pre-trained model-based vulnerability repair. Our study highlights the promising future of adopting pre-trained models to patch real-world vulnerabilities.

> Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as the connection between places and physical objects (i.e., things) over the internet/network via smart computing devices. We observed that IoT software developers share solutions to programming questions as code examples on three Stack Exchange Q&A sites: Stack Overflow (SO), Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. Previous research studies found vulnerabilities/weaknesses in C/C++ code examples shared in Stack Overflow. However, the studies did not investigate C/C++ code examples related to IoT. The studies investigated SO code examples only. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of all IoT C/C++ code examples shared in the three Stack Exchange sites, i.e., SO, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. From the 11,329 obtained code snippets from the three sites, we identify 29 distinct CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) types in 609 snippets. These CWE types can be categorized into 8 general weakness categories, and we observe that evaluation, memory, and initialization related weaknesses are the most common to be introduced by users when posting programming solutions. Furthermore, we find that 39.58% of the vulnerable code snippets contain instances of CWE types that can be mapped to real-world occurrences of those CWE types (i.e. CVE instances). The most number vulnerable IoT code examples was found in Arduino, followed by SO, and Raspberry Pi. Memory type vulnerabilities are on the rise in the sites. For example, from the 3595 mapped CVE instances, we find that 28.99% result in Denial of Service (DoS) errors, which is particularly harmful for network reliant IoT devices such as smart cars. Our study results can guide various IoT stakeholders to be aware of such vulnerable IoT code examples and to inform IoT researchers during their development of tools that can help prevent developers the sharing of such vulnerable code examples in the sites.

> A dynamic SBox using a chaotic map is a cryptography technique that changes the SBox during encryption based on iterations of a chaotic map, adding an extra layer of confusion and security to symmetric encryption algorithms like AES. The chaotic map introduces unpredictability, non-linearity, and key dependency, enhancing the overall security of the encryption process. The existing work on dynamic SBox using chaotic maps lacks standardized guidelines and extensive security analysis, leaving potential vulnerabilities and performance concerns unaddressed. Key management and the sensitivity of chaotic maps to initial conditions are challenges that need careful consideration. The main objective of using a dynamic SBox with a chaotic map in cryptography systems is to enhance the security and robustness of symmetric encryption algorithms. The method of dynamic SBox using a chaotic map involves initializing the SBox, selecting a chaotic map, iterating the map to generate chaotic values, and updating the SBox based on these values during the encryption process to enhance security and resist cryptanalytic attacks. This article proposes a novel chaotic map that can be utilized to create a fresh, lively SBox. The performance assessment of the suggested S resilience Box against various attacks involves metrics such as nonlinearity (NL), strict avalanche criterion (SAC), bit independence criterion (BIC), linear approximation probability (LP), and differential approximation probability (DP). These metrics help gauge the Box ability to handle and respond to different attack scenarios. Assess the cryptography strength of the proposed S-Box for usage in practical security applications, it is compared to other recently developed SBoxes. The comparative research shows that the suggested SBox has the potential to be an important advancement in the field of data security.

> During software development, balancing security and non security issues is challenging. We focus on security awareness and approaches taken by non-security experts using software development issue trackers when considering security. We first analyse interfaces from prominent issue trackers to see how they support security communication and how they integrate security scoring. Then, we investigate through a small scale user study what criteria developers take when prioritising issues, in particular observing their attitudes to security.   We find projects make reference to CVSS summaries (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), often alongside CVE reports (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), but issue trackers do not often have interfaces designed for this. Users in our study were not comfortable with CVSS analysis, though were able to reason in a manner compatible with CVSS. Detailed explanations and advice were seen as helpful in making security decisions. This suggests that adding improvements to communication through CVSS-like questioning in issue tracking software can elicit better security interactions.

> The security trade confidentiality, integrity and availability are the main pillar of the information systems as every organization emphasize of the security. From last few decades, digital data is the main asset for every digital or non-digital organization. The proliferation of easily accessible attack software on the internet has lowered the barrier for individuals without hacking skills to engage in malicious activities. An Industrial organization operates a server that (Confluence) serves as a learning platform for newly hired employees or Management training officers, thereby making it vulnerable to potential attacks using readily available internet-based software. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to implement a security system capable of detecting and preventing attacks, as well as conducting investigations. This research project aims to develop a comprehensive security system that can detect attack attempts, initiate preventive measures, and carry out investigations by analyzing attack logs. The study adopted a survey methodology and spanned a period of four months, from March 1, 2023, to June 31, 2023. The outcome of this research is a robust security system that effectively identifies attack attempts, blocks the attacker's IP address, and employs network forensic techniques for investigation purposes. The findings indicate that deploying Snort in IPS mode on PfSense enables the detection of attacks targeting e-learning servers, triggering automatic preventive measures such as IP address blocking. The alerts generated by Snort facilitate investigative actions through network forensics, allowing for accurate reporting on the detrimental effects of the attacks.

> This book chapter delves into the pressing need to "queer" the ethics of AI to challenge and re-evaluate the normative suppositions and values that underlie AI systems. The chapter emphasizes the ethical concerns surrounding the potential for AI to perpetuate discrimination, including binarism, and amplify existing inequalities due to the lack of representative datasets and the affordances and constraints depending on technology readiness. The chapter argues that a critical examination of the neoliberal conception of equality that often underpins non-discrimination law is necessary and cannot stress more the need to create alternative interdisciplinary approaches that consider the complex and intersecting factors that shape individuals' experiences of discrimination. By exploring such approaches centering on intersectionality and vulnerability-informed design, the chapter contends that designers and developers can create more ethical AI systems that are inclusive, equitable, and responsive to the needs and experiences of all individuals and communities, particularly those who are most vulnerable to discrimination and harm.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning representations on graphs, such as social networks. However, their vulnerability to privacy inference attacks restricts their practicality, especially in high-stake domains. To address this issue, privacy-preserving GNNs have been proposed, focusing on preserving node and/or link privacy. This work takes a step back and investigates how GNNs contribute to privacy leakage. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we identify message passing under structural bias as the core component that allows GNNs to \textit{propagate} and \textit{amplify} privacy leakage. Building upon these findings, we propose a principled privacy-preserving GNN framework that effectively safeguards both node and link privacy, referred to as dual-privacy preservation. The framework comprises three major modules: a Sensitive Information Obfuscation Module that removes sensitive information from node embeddings, a Dynamic Structure Debiasing Module that dynamically corrects the structural bias, and an Adversarial Learning Module that optimizes the privacy-utility trade-off. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in protecting both node and link privacy while preserving high utility for downstream tasks, such as node classification.

> Defining test oracles is crucial and central to test development, but manual construction of oracles is expensive. While recent neural-based automated test oracle generation techniques have shown promise, their real-world effectiveness remains a compelling question requiring further exploration and understanding. This paper investigates the effectiveness of TOGA, a recently developed neural-based method for automatic test oracle generation by Dinella et al. TOGA utilizes EvoSuite-generated test inputs and generates both exception and assertion oracles. In a Defects4j study, TOGA outperformed specification, search, and neural-based techniques, detecting 57 bugs, including 30 unique bugs not detected by other methods. To gain a deeper understanding of its applicability in real-world settings, we conducted a series of external, extended, and conceptual replication studies of TOGA.   In a large-scale study involving 25 real-world Java systems, 223.5K test cases, and 51K injected faults, we evaluate TOGA's ability to improve fault-detection effectiveness relative to the state-of-the-practice and the state-of-the-art. We find that TOGA misclassifies the type of oracle needed 24% of the time and that when it classifies correctly around 62% of the time it is not confident enough to generate any assertion oracle. When it does generate an assertion oracle, more than 47% of them are false positives, and the true positive assertions only increase fault detection by 0.3% relative to prior work. These findings expose limitations of the state-of-the-art neural-based oracle generation technique, provide valuable insights for improvement, and offer lessons for evaluating future automated oracle generation methods.

> Online Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (O-JIT-SDP) uses an online model to predict whether a new software change will introduce a bug or not. However, existing studies neglect the interaction of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) staff with the model, which may miss the opportunity to improve the prediction accuracy through the feedback from SQA staff. To tackle this problem, we propose Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) O-JIT-SDP that integrates feedback from SQA staff to enhance the prediction process. Furthermore, we introduce a performance evaluation framework that utilizes a k-fold distributed bootstrap method along with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. This framework facilitates thorough pairwise comparisons of alternative classification algorithms using a prequential evaluation approach. Our proposal enables continuous statistical testing throughout the prequential process, empowering developers to make real-time decisions based on robust statistical evidence. Through experimentation across 10 GitHub projects, we demonstrate that our evaluation framework enhances the credibility of model evaluation, and the incorporation of HITL feedback elevates the prediction performance of online JIT-SDP models. These advancements hold the potential to significantly enhance the value of O-JIT-SDP for industrial applications.

> Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been very effective in addressing the issue of various graph-structured related tasks. However, recent research has shown that GCNs are vulnerable to a new type of threat called a backdoor attack, where the adversary can inject a hidden backdoor into GCNs so that the attacked model performs well on benign samples, but its prediction will be maliciously changed to the attacker-specified target label if the hidden backdoor is activated by the attacker-defined trigger. A semantic backdoor attack is a new type of backdoor attack on deep neural networks (DNNs), where a naturally occurring semantic feature of samples can serve as a backdoor trigger such that the infected DNN models will misclassify testing samples containing the predefined semantic feature even without the requirement of modifying the testing samples. Since the backdoor trigger is a naturally occurring semantic feature of the samples, semantic backdoor attacks are more imperceptible and pose a new and serious threat. In this paper, we investigate whether such semantic backdoor attacks are possible for GCNs and propose a semantic backdoor attack against GCNs (SBAG) under the context of graph classification to reveal the existence of this security vulnerability in GCNs. SBAG uses a certain type of node in the samples as a backdoor trigger and injects a hidden backdoor into GCN models by poisoning training data. The backdoor will be activated, and the GCN models will give malicious classification results specified by the attacker even on unmodified samples as long as the samples contain enough trigger nodes. We evaluate SBAG on four graph datasets and the experimental results indicate that SBAG is effective.

- *Truc Nguyen, My T. Thai*

- `2007.08600v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08600v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08600v5)

> Since 2016, sharding has become an auspicious solution to tackle the scalability issue in legacy blockchain systems. Despite its potential to strongly boost the blockchain throughput, sharding comes with its own security issues. To ease the process of deciding which shard to place transactions, existing sharding protocols use a hash-based transaction sharding in which the hash value of a transaction determines its output shard. Unfortunately, we show that this mechanism opens up a loophole that could be exploited to conduct a single-shard flooding attack, a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, to overwhelm a single shard that ends up reducing the performance of the system as a whole.   To counter the single-shard flooding attack, we propose a countermeasure that essentially eliminates the loophole by rejecting the use of hash-based transaction sharding. The countermeasure leverages the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to let blockchain's validators securely execute a transaction sharding algorithm with a negligible overhead. We provide a formal specification for the countermeasure and analyze its security properties in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept is developed to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our solution.

> Language generation models have been an increasingly powerful enabler for many applications. Many such models offer free or affordable API access, which makes them potentially vulnerable to model extraction attacks through distillation. To protect intellectual property (IP) and ensure fair use of these models, various techniques such as lexical watermarking and synonym replacement have been proposed. However, these methods can be nullified by obvious countermeasures such as "synonym randomization". To address this issue, we propose GINSEW, a novel method to protect text generation models from being stolen through distillation. The key idea of our method is to inject secret signals into the probability vector of the decoding steps for each target token. We can then detect the secret message by probing a suspect model to tell if it is distilled from the protected one. Experimental results show that GINSEW can effectively identify instances of IP infringement with minimal impact on the generation quality of protected APIs. Our method demonstrates an absolute improvement of 19 to 29 points on mean average precision (mAP) in detecting suspects compared to previous methods against watermark removal attacks.

- *Zhilin Zhao, Longbing Cao, Kun-Yu Lin*

> In deep neural learning, a discriminator trained on in-distribution (ID) samples may make high-confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This triggers a significant matter for robust, trustworthy and safe deep learning. The issue is primarily caused by the limited ID samples observable in training the discriminator when OOD samples are unavailable. We propose a general approach for \textit{fine-tuning discriminators by implicit generators} (FIG). FIG is grounded on information theory and applicable to standard discriminators without retraining. It improves the ability of a standard discriminator in distinguishing ID and OOD samples by generating and penalizing its specific OOD samples. According to the Shannon entropy, an energy-based implicit generator is inferred from a discriminator without extra training costs. Then, a Langevin dynamic sampler draws specific OOD samples for the implicit generator. Lastly, we design a regularizer fitting the design principle of the implicit generator to induce high entropy on those generated OOD samples. The experiments on different networks and datasets demonstrate that FIG achieves the state-of-the-art OOD detection performance.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have exploded a new heatwave of AI for their ability to engage end-users in human-level conversations with detailed and articulate answers across many knowledge domains. In response to their fast adoption in many industrial applications, this survey concerns their safety and trustworthiness. First, we review known vulnerabilities and limitations of the LLMs, categorising them into inherent issues, attacks, and unintended bugs. Then, we consider if and how the Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques, which have been widely developed for traditional software and deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks as independent processes to check the alignment of their implementations against the specifications, can be integrated and further extended throughout the lifecycle of the LLMs to provide rigorous analysis to the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs and their applications. Specifically, we consider four complementary techniques: falsification and evaluation, verification, runtime monitoring, and regulations and ethical use. In total, 370+ references are considered to support the quick understanding of the safety and trustworthiness issues from the perspective of V&V. While intensive research has been conducted to identify the safety and trustworthiness issues, rigorous yet practical methods are called for to ensure the alignment of LLMs with safety and trustworthiness requirements.

> Artificial intelligence (AI) promises immense benefits across sectors, yet also poses risks from dual-use potentials, biases, and unintended behaviors. This paper reviews emerging issues with opaque and uncontrollable AI systems and proposes an integrative framework called violet teaming to develop reliable and responsible AI. Violet teaming combines adversarial vulnerability probing (red teaming) with solutions for safety and security (blue teaming) while prioritizing ethics and social benefit. It emerged from AI safety research to manage risks proactively by design. The paper traces the evolution of red, blue, and purple teaming toward violet teaming, and then discusses applying violet techniques to address biosecurity risks of AI in biotechnology. Additional sections review key perspectives across law, ethics, cybersecurity, macrostrategy, and industry best practices essential for operationalizing responsible AI through holistic technical and social considerations. Violet teaming provides both philosophy and method for steering AI trajectories toward societal good. With conscience and wisdom, the extraordinary capabilities of AI can enrich humanity. But without adequate precaution, the risks could prove catastrophic. Violet teaming aims to empower moral technology for the common welfare.

- `2205.10292v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10292v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10292v3)

> Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT) can be used for on-demand recharging of Electric Vehicles (EV) while driving. However, DWPT raises numerous security and privacy concerns. Recently, researchers demonstrated that DWPT systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In an EV charging scenario, an attacker can prevent the authorized customer from charging, obtain a free charge by billing a victim user and track a target vehicle. State-of-the-art authentication schemes relying on centralized solutions are either vulnerable to various attacks or have high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for a dynamic scenario. In this paper, we propose Quick Electric Vehicle SEcure Charging (QEVSEC), a novel, secure, and efficient authentication protocol for the dynamic charging of EVs. Our idea for QEVSEC originates from multiple vulnerabilities we found in the state-of-the-art protocol that allows tracking of user activity and is susceptible to replay attacks. Based on these observations, the proposed protocol solves these issues and achieves lower computational complexity by using only primitive cryptographic operations in a very short message exchange. QEVSEC provides scalability and a reduced cost in each iteration, thus lowering the impact on the power needed from the grid.

> In recent years, artificial intelligence has had a conspicuous growth in almost every aspect of life. One of the most applicable areas is security code review, in which a lot of AI-based tools and approaches have been proposed. Recently, ChatGPT has caught a huge amount of attention with its remarkable performance in following instructions and providing a detailed response. Regarding the similarities between natural language and code, in this paper, we study the feasibility of using ChatGPT for vulnerability detection in Python source code. Toward this goal, we feed an appropriate prompt along with vulnerable data to ChatGPT and compare its results on two datasets with the results of three widely used Static Application Security Testing tools (Bandit, Semgrep and SonarQube). We implement different kinds of experiments with ChatGPT and the results indicate that ChatGPT reduces the false positive and false negative rates and has the potential to be used for Python source code vulnerability detection.

> Bug fixing holds significant importance in software development and maintenance. Recent research has made notable progress in exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatic bug fixing. However, existing studies often overlook the collaborative nature of bug resolution, treating it as a single-stage process. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel stage-wise framework named STEAM in this paper. The objective of STEAM is to simulate the interactive behavior of multiple programmers involved in various stages across the bug's life cycle. Taking inspiration from bug management practices, we decompose the bug fixing task into four distinct stages: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification. These stages are performed interactively by LLMs, aiming to imitate the collaborative abilities of programmers during the resolution of software bugs. By harnessing the collective contribution, STEAM effectively enhances the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We implement STEAM by employing the powerful dialogue-based LLM -- ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely adopted bug-fixing benchmark demonstrates that STEAM has achieved a new state-of-the-art level of bug-fixing performance.

> Developers interrupting their participation in a project might slowly forget critical information about the code, such as its intended purpose, structure, the impact of external dependencies, and the approach used for implementation. Forgetting the implementation details can have detrimental effects on software maintenance, comprehension, knowledge sharing, and developer productivity, resulting in bugs, and other issues that can negatively influence the software development process. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that developers have a clear understanding of the codebase and can work efficiently and effectively even after long interruptions. This registered report proposes an empirical study aimed at investigating the impact of the developer's activity breaks duration and different code quality properties. In particular, we aim at understanding if the amount of activity in a project impact the code quality, and if developers with different activity profiles show different impacts on code quality. The results might be useful to understand if it is beneficial to promote the practice of developing multiple projects in parallel, or if it is more beneficial to reduce the number of projects each developer contributes.

> Rapid progress is being made in developing large, pretrained, task-agnostic foundational vision models such as CLIP, ALIGN, DINOv2, etc. In fact, we are approaching the point where these models do not have to be finetuned downstream, and can simply be used in zero-shot or with a lightweight probing head. Critically, given the complexity of working at this scale, there is a bottleneck where relatively few organizations in the world are executing the training then sharing the models on centralized platforms such as HuggingFace and torch.hub. The goal of this work is to identify several key adversarial vulnerabilities of these models in an effort to make future designs more robust. Intuitively, our attacks manipulate deep feature representations to fool an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector which will be required when using these open-world-aware models to solve closed-set downstream tasks. Our methods reliably make in-distribution (ID) images (w.r.t. a downstream task) be predicted as OOD and vice versa while existing in extremely low-knowledge-assumption threat models. We show our attacks to be potent in whitebox and blackbox settings, as well as when transferred across foundational model types (e.g., attack DINOv2 with CLIP)! This work is only just the beginning of a long journey towards adversarially robust foundational vision models.

> Local differential privacy techniques for numerical data typically transform a dataset to ensure a bound on the likelihood that, given a query, a malicious user could infer information on the original samples. Queries are often solely based on users and their requirements, limiting the design of the perturbation to processes that, while privatizing the results, do not jeopardize their usefulness. In this paper, we propose a privatization technique called Zeal, where perturbator and aggregator are designed as a unit, resulting in a locally differentially private mechanism that, by-design, improves the compressibility of the perturbed dataset compared to the original, saves on transmitted bits for data collection and protects against a privacy vulnerabilities due to floating point arithmetic that affect other state-of-the-art schemes. We prove that the utility error on querying the average is invariant to the bias introduced by Zeal in a wide range of conditions, and that under the same circumstances, Zeal also guarantee protection against the aforementioned vulnerability. Our numerical results show up to 94% improvements in compression and up to 95% more efficient data transmissions, while keeping utility errors within 2%.

> Detecting online sexual predatory behaviours and abusive language on social media platforms has become a critical area of research due to the growing concerns about online safety, especially for vulnerable populations such as children and adolescents. Researchers have been exploring various techniques and approaches to develop effective detection systems that can identify and mitigate these risks. Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has opened a new opportunity to address this problem more effectively. This paper proposes an approach to detection of online sexual predatory chats and abusive language using the open-source pretrained Llama 2 7B-parameter model, recently released by Meta GenAI. We fine-tune the LLM using datasets with different sizes, imbalance degrees, and languages (i.e., English, Roman Urdu and Urdu). Based on the power of LLMs, our approach is generic and automated without a manual search for a synergy between feature extraction and classifier design steps like conventional methods in this domain. Experimental results show a strong performance of the proposed approach, which performs proficiently and consistently across three distinct datasets with five sets of experiments. This study's outcomes indicate that the proposed method can be implemented in real-world applications (even with non-English languages) for flagging sexual predators, offensive or toxic content, hate speech, and discriminatory language in online discussions and comments to maintain respectful internet or digital communities. Furthermore, it can be employed for solving text classification problems with other potential applications such as sentiment analysis, spam and phishing detection, sorting legal documents, fake news detection, language identification, user intent recognition, text-based product categorization, medical record analysis, and resume screening.

> Modern systems mitigate Rowhammer using victim refresh, which refreshes the two neighbours of an aggressor row when it encounters a specified number of activations. Unfortunately, complex attack patterns like Half-Double break victim-refresh, rendering current systems vulnerable. Instead, recently proposed secure Rowhammer mitigations rely on performing mitigative action on the aggressor rather than the victims. Such schemes employ mitigative actions such as row-migration or access-control and include AQUA, SRS, and Blockhammer. While these schemes incur only modest slowdowns at Rowhammer thresholds of few thousand, they incur prohibitive slowdowns (15%-600%) for lower thresholds that are likely in the near future. The goal of our paper is to make secure Rowhammer mitigations practical at such low thresholds.   Our paper provides the key insights that benign application encounter thousands of hot rows (receiving more activations than the threshold) due to the memory mapping, which places spatially proximate lines in the same row to maximize row-buffer hitrate. Unfortunately, this causes row to receive activations for many frequently used lines. We propose Rubix, which breaks the spatial correlation in the line-to-row mapping by using an encrypted address to access the memory, reducing the likelihood of hot rows by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. To aid row-buffer hits, Rubix randomizes a group of 1-4 lines. We also propose Rubix-D, which dynamically changes the line-to-row mapping. Rubix-D minimizes hot-rows and makes it much harder for an adversary to learn the spatial neighbourhood of a row. Rubix reduces the slowdown of AQUA (from 15% to 1%), SRS (from 60% to 2%), and Blockhammer (from 600% to 3%) while incurring a storage of less than 1 Kilobyte.

> Federated learning is known to be vulnerable to both security and privacy issues. Existing research has focused either on preventing poisoning attacks from users or on concealing the local model updates from the server, but not both. However, integrating these two lines of research remains a crucial challenge since they often conflict with one another with respect to the threat model. In this work, we develop a principle framework that offers both privacy guarantees for users and detection against poisoning attacks from them. With a new threat model that includes both an honest-but-curious server and malicious users, we first propose a secure aggregation protocol using homomorphic encryption for the server to combine local model updates in a private manner. Then, a zero-knowledge proof protocol is leveraged to shift the task of detecting attacks in the local models from the server to the users. The key observation here is that the server no longer needs access to the local models for attack detection. Therefore, our framework enables the central server to identify poisoned model updates without violating the privacy guarantees of secure aggregation.

> Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) based perception systems have been the foundation in supporting many industrial applications and domains, such as self-driving cars, robotic arms, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Over the past few years, the fast progress in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) has brought a fast-increasing trend to empower MSF systems by deep learning techniques to further improve performance, especially on intelligent systems and their perception systems. Although quite a few AI-enabled MSF perception systems and techniques have been proposed, up to the present, limited benchmarks that focus on MSF perception are publicly available. Given that many intelligent systems such as self-driving cars are operated in safety-critical contexts where perception systems play an important role, there comes an urgent need for a more in-depth understanding of the performance and reliability of these MSF systems. To bridge this gap, we initiate an early step in this direction and construct a public benchmark of AI-enabled MSF-based perception systems including three commonly adopted tasks (i.e., object detection, object tracking, and depth completion). Based on this, to comprehensively understand MSF systems' robustness and reliability, we design 14 common and realistic corruption patterns to synthesize large-scale corrupted datasets. We further perform a systematic evaluation of these systems through our large-scale evaluation. Our results reveal the vulnerability of the current AI-enabled MSF perception systems, calling for researchers and practitioners to take robustness and reliability into account when designing AI-enabled MSF.

> Code models, such as CodeBERT and CodeT5, offer general-purpose representations of code and play a vital role in supporting downstream automated software engineering tasks. Most recently, code models were revealed to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A code model that is backdoor-attacked can behave normally on clean examples but will produce pre-defined malicious outputs on examples injected with triggers that activate the backdoors. Existing backdoor attacks on code models use unstealthy and easy-to-detect triggers. This paper aims to investigate the vulnerability of code models with stealthy backdoor attacks. To this end, we propose AFRAIDOOR (Adversarial Feature as Adaptive Backdoor). AFRAIDOOR achieves stealthiness by leveraging adversarial perturbations to inject adaptive triggers into different inputs. We evaluate AFRAIDOOR on three widely adopted code models (CodeBERT, PLBART and CodeT5) and two downstream tasks (code summarization and method name prediction). We find that around 85% of adaptive triggers in AFRAIDOOR bypass the detection in the defense process. By contrast, only less than 12% of the triggers from previous work bypass the defense. When the defense method is not applied, both AFRAIDOOR and baselines have almost perfect attack success rates. However, once a defense is applied, the success rates of baselines decrease dramatically to 10.47% and 12.06%, while the success rate of AFRAIDOOR are 77.05% and 92.98% on the two tasks. Our finding exposes security weaknesses in code models under stealthy backdoor attacks and shows that the state-of-the-art defense method cannot provide sufficient protection. We call for more research efforts in understanding security threats to code models and developing more effective countermeasures.

To facilitate the reuse of Rust code, crates.io, as a central package registry of the Rust ecosystem, hosts thousands of third-party Rust packages. The openness of crates.io enables the growth of the Rust ecosystem but comes with security risks by severe security advisories. Although Rust guarantees a software program to be safe via programming language features and strict compile-time checking, the unsafe keyword in Rust allows developers to bypass compiler safety checks for certain regions of code. Prior studies empirically investigate the memory safety and concurrency bugs in the Rust ecosystem, as well as the usage of unsafe keywords in practice. Nonetheless, the literature lacks a systematic investigation of the security risks in the Rust ecosystem.   In this paper, we perform a comprehensive investigation into the security risks present in the Rust ecosystem, asking ``what are the characteristics of the vulnerabilities, what are the characteristics of the vulnerable packages, and how are the vulnerabilities fixed in practice?''. To facilitate the study, we first compile a dataset of 433 vulnerabilities, 300 vulnerable code repositories, and 218 vulnerability fix commits in the Rust ecosystem, spanning over 7 years. With the dataset, we characterize the types, life spans, and evolution of the disclosed vulnerabilities. We then characterize the popularity, categorization, and vulnerability density of the vulnerable Rust packages, as well as their versions and code regions affected by the disclosed vulnerabilities. Finally, we characterize the complexity of vulnerability fixes and localities of corresponding code changes, and inspect how practitioners fix vulnerabilities in Rust packages with various localities.

- `2308.07309v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07309v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07309v2)

> Crypto-wallets or digital asset wallets are a crucial aspect of managing cryptocurrencies and other digital assets such as NFTs. However, these wallets are not immune to security threats, particularly from the growing risk of quantum computing. The use of traditional public-key cryptography systems in digital asset wallets makes them vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers, which may increase in the future. Moreover, current digital wallets require users to keep track of seed-phrases, which can be challenging and lead to additional security risks. To overcome these challenges, a new algorithm is proposed that uses post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to enhance the security of digital asset wallets. The research focuses on the use of the Lattice-based Threshold Secret Sharing Scheme (LTSSS), Kyber Algorithm for key generation and ZKP for wallet unlocking, providing a more secure and user-friendly alternative to seed-phrase, brain and multi-sig protocol wallets. This algorithm also includes several innovative security features such as recovery of wallets in case of downtime of the server, and the ability to rekey the private key associated with a specific username-password combination, offering improved security and usability. The incorporation of PQC and ZKP provides a robust and comprehensive framework for securing digital assets in the present and future. This research aims to address the security challenges faced by digital asset wallets and proposes practical solutions to ensure their safety in the era of quantum computing.

> OAuth protocols have been widely adopted to simplify user authentication and service authorization for third-party applications. However, little effort has been devoted to automatically checking the security of the libraries that service providers widely use. In this paper, we formalize the OAuth specifications and security best practices, and design Cerberus, an automated static analyzer, to find logical flaws and identify vulnerabilities in the implementation of OAuth service provider libraries. To efficiently detect security violations in a large codebase of service provider implementation, Cerberus employs a query-driven algorithm for answering queries about OAuth specifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cerberus by evaluating it on datasets of popular OAuth libraries with millions of downloads. Among these high-profile libraries, Cerberus has identified 47 vulnerabilities from ten classes of logical flaws, 24 of which were previously unknown. We got acknowledged by the developers of eight libraries and had three accepted CVEs.

> The growth of open-source software has increased the risk of hidden vulnerabilities that can affect downstream software applications. This concern is further exacerbated by software vendors' practice of silently releasing security patches without explicit warnings or common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) notifications. This lack of transparency leaves users unaware of potential security threats, giving attackers an opportunity to take advantage of these vulnerabilities. In the complex landscape of software patches, grasping the nuanced semantics of a patch is vital for ensuring secure software maintenance. To address this challenge, we introduce a multilevel Semantic Embedder for security patch detection, termed MultiSEM. This model harnesses word-centric vectors at a fine-grained level, emphasizing the significance of individual words, while the coarse-grained layer adopts entire code lines for vector representation, capturing the essence and interrelation of added or removed lines. We further enrich this representation by assimilating patch descriptions to obtain a holistic semantic portrait. This combination of multi-layered embeddings offers a robust representation, balancing word complexity, understanding code-line insights, and patch descriptions. Evaluating MultiSEM for detecting patch security, our results demonstrate its superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art models with promising margins: a 22.46\% improvement on PatchDB and a 9.21\% on SPI-DB in terms of the F1 metric.

> We study an adversary who attacks a Proof-of-Work (POW) blockchain by selfishly constructing an alternative longest chain. We characterize optimal strategies employed by the adversary when a difficulty adjustment rule al\`a Bitcoin applies. As time (namely the times-tamp specified in each block) in most permissionless POW blockchains is somewhat subjective, we focus on two extreme scenarios: when time is completely verifiable, and when it is completely unverifiable. We conclude that an adversary who faces a difficulty adjustment rule will find a longest-chain attack very challenging when timestamps are verifiable. POW blockchains with frequent difficulty adjustments relative to time reporting flexibility will be substantially more vulnerable to longest-chain attacks. Our main fining provides guidance on the design of difficulty adjustment rules and demonstrates the importance of timestamp verifiability.

> Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), such as the convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have been successfully applied in the field of computer vision, they are demonstrated to be vulnerable to well-sought Adversarial Examples (AEs) that can easily fool the DNNs. The research in AEs has been active, and many adversarial attacks and explanations have been proposed since they were discovered in 2014. The mystery of the AE's existence is still an open question, and many studies suggest that DNN training algorithms have blind spots. The salient objects usually do not overlap with boundaries; hence, the boundaries are not the DNN model's attention. Nevertheless, recent studies show that the boundaries can dominate the behavior of the DNN models. Hence, this study aims to look at the AEs from a different perspective and proposes an imperceptible adversarial attack that systemically attacks the input image boundary for finding the AEs. The experimental results have shown that the proposed boundary attacking method effectively attacks six CNN models and the ViT using only 32% of the input image content (from the boundaries) with an average success rate (SR) of 95.2% and an average peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.37 dB. Correlation analyses are conducted, including the relation between the adversarial boundary's width and the SR and how the adversarial boundary changes the DNN model's attention. This paper's discoveries can potentially advance the understanding of AEs and provide a different perspective on how AEs can be constructed.

> Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) has been proven vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in realistic large-scale unsupervised datasets due to over-confident pseudo-labeling OODs as in-distribution (ID). A key underlying problem is class-wise latent space spreading from closed seen space to open unseen space, and the bias is further magnified in SSL's self-training loops. To close the ID distribution set so that OODs are better rejected for safe SSL, we propose Prototype Fission(PF) to divide class-wise latent spaces into compact sub-spaces by automatic fine-grained latent space mining, driven by coarse-grained labels only. Specifically, we form multiple unique learnable sub-class prototypes for each class, optimized towards both diversity and consistency. The Diversity Modeling term encourages samples to be clustered by one of the multiple sub-class prototypes, while the Consistency Modeling term clusters all samples of the same class to a global prototype. Instead of "opening set", i.e., modeling OOD distribution, Prototype Fission "closes set" and makes it hard for OOD samples to fit in sub-class latent space. Therefore, PF is compatible with existing methods for further performance gains. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in open-set SSL settings in terms of successfully forming sub-classes, discriminating OODs from IDs and improving overall accuracy. Codes will be released.

> As powerful tools for representation learning on graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) have played an important role in applications including social networks, recommendation systems, and online web services. However, GNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly degrade their effectiveness. Recent state-of-the-art approaches in adversarial attacks rely on gradient-based meta-learning to selectively perturb a single edge with the highest attack score until they reach the budget constraint. While effective in identifying vulnerable links, these methods are plagued by high computational costs. By leveraging continuous relaxation and parameterization of the graph structure, we propose a novel attack method called Differentiable Graph Attack (DGA) to efficiently generate effective attacks and meanwhile eliminate the need for costly retraining. Compared to the state-of-the-art, DGA achieves nearly equivalent attack performance with 6 times less training time and 11 times smaller GPU memory footprint on different benchmark datasets. Additionally, we provide extensive experimental analyses of the transferability of the DGA among different graph models, as well as its robustness against widely-used defense mechanisms.

> Adversarial example detection plays a vital role in adaptive cyber defense, especially in the face of rapidly evolving attacks. In adaptive cyber defense, the nature and characteristics of attacks continuously change, making it crucial to have robust mechanisms in place to detect and counter these threats effectively. By incorporating adversarial example detection techniques, adaptive cyber defense systems can enhance their ability to identify and mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in machine learning models or other systems. Adversarial examples are inputs that are crafted by applying intentional perturbations to natural inputs that result in incorrect classification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and introduces the concept of Space Exploration Features. We utilize the feature vectors obtained from the BERT model's output to capture a new representation of feature space to improve the density estimation method.

> The neural network (NN) becomes one of the most heated type of models in various signal processing applications. However, NNs are extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). To defend AEs, adversarial training (AT) is believed to be the most effective method while due to the intensive computation, AT is limited to be applied in most applications. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we design a generic and efficient AT improvement scheme, namely case-aware adversarial training (CAT). Specifically, the intuition stems from the fact that a very limited part of informative samples can contribute to most of model performance. Alternatively, if only the most informative AEs are used in AT, we can lower the computation complexity of AT significantly as maintaining the defense effect. To achieve this, CAT achieves two breakthroughs. First, a method to estimate the information degree of adversarial examples is proposed for AE filtering. Second, to further enrich the information that the NN can obtain from AEs, CAT involves a weight estimation and class-level balancing based sampling strategy to increase the diversity of AT at each iteration. Extensive experiments show that CAT is faster than vanilla AT by up to 3x while achieving competitive defense effect.

> In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the security of text input fields in web browsers. We find that browsers' coarse-grained permission model violates two security design principles: least privilege and complete mediation. We further uncover two vulnerabilities in input fields, including the alarming discovery of passwords in plaintext within the HTML source code of the web page. To demonstrate the real-world impact of these vulnerabilities, we design a proof-of-concept extension, leveraging techniques from static and dynamic code injection attacks to bypass the web store review process. Our measurements and case studies reveal that these vulnerabilities are prevalent across various websites, with sensitive user information, such as passwords, exposed in the HTML source code of even high-traffic sites like Google and Cloudflare. We find that a significant percentage (12.5\%) of extensions possess the necessary permissions to exploit these vulnerabilities and identify 190 extensions that directly access password fields. Finally, we propose two countermeasures to address these risks: a bolt-on JavaScript package for immediate adoption by website developers allowing them to protect sensitive input fields, and a browser-level solution that alerts users when an extension accesses sensitive input fields. Our research highlights the urgent need for improved security measures to protect sensitive user information online.

> Software development projects rely on issue tracking systems at the core of tracking maintenance tasks such as bug reports, and enhancement requests. Incoming issue-reports on these issue tracking systems must be managed in an effective manner. First, they must be labelled and then assigned to a particular developer with relevant expertise. This handling of issue-reports is critical and requires thorough scanning of the text entered in an issue-report making it a labor-intensive task. In this paper, we present a unified framework called MaintainoMATE, which is capable of automatically categorizing the issue-reports in their respective category and further assigning the issue-reports to a developer with relevant expertise. We use the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), as an underlying model for MaintainoMATE to learn the contextual information for automatic issue-report labeling and assignment tasks. We deploy the framework used in this work as a GitHub application. We empirically evaluate our approach on GitHub issue-reports to show its capability of assigning labels to the issue-reports. We were able to achieve an F1-score close to 80\%, which is comparable to existing state-of-the-art results. Similarly, our initial evaluations show that we can assign relevant developers to the issue-reports with an F1 score of 54\%, which is a significant improvement over existing approaches. Our initial findings suggest that MaintainoMATE has the potential of improving software quality and reducing maintenance costs by accurately automating activities involved in the maintenance processes. Our future work would be directed towards improving the issue-assignment module.

> One of the critical phases in software development is software testing. Testing helps with identifying potential bugs and reducing maintenance costs. The goal of automated test generation tools is to ease the development of tests by suggesting efficient bug-revealing tests. Recently, researchers have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) of code to generate unit tests. While the code coverage of generated tests was usually assessed, the literature has acknowledged that the coverage is weakly correlated with the efficiency of tests in bug detection. To improve over this limitation, in this paper, we introduce MuTAP for improving the effectiveness of test cases generated by LLMs in terms of revealing bugs by leveraging mutation testing. Our goal is achieved by augmenting prompts with surviving mutants, as those mutants highlight the limitations of test cases in detecting bugs. MuTAP is capable of generating effective test cases in the absence of natural language descriptions of the Program Under Test (PUTs). We employ different LLMs within MuTAP and evaluate their performance on different benchmarks. Our results show that our proposed method is able to detect up to 28% more faulty human-written code snippets. Among these, 17% remained undetected by both the current state-of-the-art fully automated test generation tool (i.e., Pynguin) and zero-shot/few-shot learning approaches on LLMs. Furthermore, MuTAP achieves a Mutation Score (MS) of 93.57% on synthetic buggy code, outperforming all other approaches in our evaluation. Our findings suggest that although LLMs can serve as a useful tool to generate test cases, they require specific post-processing steps to enhance the effectiveness of the generated test cases which may suffer from syntactic or functional errors and may be ineffective in detecting certain types of bugs and testing corner cases PUTs.

> With the large-scale integration and use of neural network models, especially in critical embedded systems, their security assessment to guarantee their reliability is becoming an urgent need. More particularly, models deployed in embedded platforms, such as 32-bit microcontrollers, are physically accessible by adversaries and therefore vulnerable to hardware disturbances. We present the first set of experiments on the use of two fault injection means, electromagnetic and laser injections, applied on neural networks models embedded on a Cortex M4 32-bit microcontroller platform. Contrary to most of state-of-the-art works dedicated to the alteration of the internal parameters or input values, our goal is to simulate and experimentally demonstrate the impact of a specific fault model that is instruction skip. For that purpose, we assessed several modification attacks on the control flow of a neural network inference. We reveal integrity threats by targeting several steps in the inference program of typical convolutional neural network models, which may be exploited by an attacker to alter the predictions of the target models with different adversarial goals.

> A behavioral authentication (BA) system uses the behavioral characteristics of users to verify their identity claims. A BA verification algorithm can be constructed by training a neural network (NN) classifier on users' profiles. The trained NN model classifies the presented verification data, and if the classification matches the claimed identity, the verification algorithm accepts the claim. This classification-based approach removes the need to maintain a profile database. However, similar to other NN architectures, the NN classifier of the BA system is vulnerable to privacy attacks. To protect the privacy of training and test data used in an NN different techniques are widely used. In this paper, our focus is on a non-crypto-based approach, and we used random projection (RP) to ensure data privacy in an NN model. RP is a distance-preserving transformation based on a random matrix. Before sharing the profiles with the verifier, users will transform their profiles by RP and keep their matrices secret. To reduce the computation load in RP, we use sparse random projection, which is very effective for low-compute devices. Along with correctness and security properties, our system can ensure the changeability property of the BA system. We also introduce an ML-based privacy attack, and our proposed system is robust against this and other privacy and security attacks. We implemented our approach on three existing behavioral BA systems and achieved a below 2.0% FRR and a below 1.0% FAR rate. Moreover, the machine learning-based privacy attacker can only recover below 3.0% to 12.0% of features from a portion of the projected profiles. However, these recovered features are not sufficient to know details about the users' behavioral pattern or to be used in a subsequent attack. Our approach is general and can be used in other NN-based BA systems as well as in traditional biometric systems.

> Federated learning (FL) is a framework for training machine learning models in a distributed and collaborative manner. During training, a set of participating clients process their data stored locally, sharing only the model updates obtained by minimizing a cost function over their local inputs. FL was proposed as a stepping-stone towards privacy-preserving machine learning, but it has been shown vulnerable to issues such as leakage of private information, lack of personalization of the model, and the possibility of having a trained model that is fairer to some groups than to others. In this paper, we address the triadic interaction among personalization, privacy guarantees, and fairness attained by models trained within the FL framework. Differential privacy and its variants have been studied and applied as cutting-edge standards for providing formal privacy guarantees. However, clients in FL often hold very diverse datasets representing heterogeneous communities, making it important to protect their sensitive information while still ensuring that the trained model upholds the aspect of fairness for the users. To attain this objective, a method is put forth that introduces group privacy assurances through the utilization of $d$-privacy (aka metric privacy). $d$-privacy represents a localized form of differential privacy that relies on a metric-oriented obfuscation approach to maintain the original data's topological distribution. This method, besides enabling personalized model training in a federated approach and providing formal privacy guarantees, possesses significantly better group fairness measured under a variety of standard metrics than a global model trained within a classical FL template. Theoretical justifications for the applicability are provided, as well as experimental validation on real-world datasets to illustrate the working of the proposed method.

> Deep learning (DL) applications, built upon a heterogeneous and complex DL stack (e.g., Nvidia GPU, Linux, CUDA driver, Python runtime, and TensorFlow), are subject to software and hardware dependencies across the DL stack. One challenge in dependency management across the entire engineering lifecycle is posed by the asynchronous and radical evolution and the complex version constraints among dependencies. Developers may introduce dependency bugs (DBs) in selecting, using and maintaining dependencies. However, the characteristics of DBs in DL stack is still under-investigated, hindering practical solutions to dependency management in DL stack. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study to characterize symptoms, root causes and fix patterns of DBs across the whole DL stack with 446 DBs collected from StackOverflow posts and GitHub issues. For each DB, we first investigate the symptom as well as the lifecycle stage and dependency where the symptom is exposed. Then, we analyze the root cause as well as the lifecycle stage and dependency where the root cause is introduced. Finally, we explore the fix pattern and the knowledge sources that are used to fix it. Our findings from this study shed light on practical implications on dependency management.

> Deep Learning (DL) frameworks are now widely used, simplifying the creation of complex models as well as their integration to various applications even to non DL experts. However, like any other programs, they are prone to bugs. This paper deals with the subcategory of bugs named silent bugs: they lead to wrong behavior but they do not cause system crashes or hangs, nor show an error message to the user. Such bugs are even more dangerous in DL applications and frameworks due to the "black-box" and stochastic nature of the systems (the end user can not understand how the model makes decisions). This paper presents the first empirical study of Keras and TensorFlow silent bugs, and their impact on users' programs. We extracted closed issues related to Keras from the TensorFlow GitHub repository. Out of the 1,168 issues that we gathered, 77 were reproducible silent bugs affecting users' programs. We categorized the bugs based on the effects on the users' programs and the components where the issues occurred, using information from the issue reports. We then derived a threat level for each of the issues, based on the impact they had on the users' programs. To assess the relevance of identified categories and the impact scale, we conducted an online survey with 103 DL developers. The participants generally agreed with the significant impact of silent bugs in DL libraries and acknowledged our findings (i.e., categories of silent bugs and the proposed impact scale). Finally, leveraging our analysis, we provide a set of guidelines to facilitate safeguarding against such bugs in DL frameworks.

> Deep Learning (DL) is increasingly used in safety-critical applications, raising concerns about its reliability. DL suffers from a well-known problem of lacking robustness, especially when faced with adversarial perturbations known as Adversarial Examples (AEs). Despite recent efforts to detect AEs using advanced attack and testing methods, these approaches often overlook the input distribution and perceptual quality of the perturbations. As a result, the detected AEs may not be relevant in practical applications or may appear unrealistic to human observers. This can waste testing resources on rare AEs that seldom occur during real-world use, limiting improvements in DL model dependability.   In this paper, we propose a new robustness testing approach for detecting AEs that considers both the feature level distribution and the pixel level distribution, capturing the perceptual quality of adversarial perturbations. The two considerations are encoded by a novel hierarchical mechanism. First, we select test seeds based on the density of feature level distribution and the vulnerability of adversarial robustness. The vulnerability of test seeds are indicated by the auxiliary information, that are highly correlated with local robustness. Given a test seed, we then develop a novel genetic algorithm based local test case generation method, in which two fitness functions work alternatively to control the perceptual quality of detected AEs. Finally, extensive experiments confirm that our holistic approach considering hierarchical distributions is superior to the state-of-the-arts that either disregard any input distribution or only consider a single (non-hierarchical) distribution, in terms of not only detecting imperceptible AEs but also improving the overall robustness of the DL model under testing.

> Object detection is the foundation of various critical computer-vision tasks such as segmentation, object tracking, and event detection. To train an object detector with satisfactory accuracy, a large amount of data is required. However, due to the intensive workforce involved with annotating large datasets, such a data curation task is often outsourced to a third party or relied on volunteers. This work reveals severe vulnerabilities of such data curation pipeline. We propose MACAB that crafts clean-annotated images to stealthily implant the backdoor into the object detectors trained on them even when the data curator can manually audit the images. We observe that the backdoor effect of both misclassification and the cloaking are robustly achieved in the wild when the backdoor is activated with inconspicuously natural physical triggers. Backdooring non-classification object detection with clean-annotation is challenging compared to backdooring existing image classification tasks with clean-label, owing to the complexity of having multiple objects within each frame, including victim and non-victim objects. The efficacy of the MACAB is ensured by constructively i abusing the image-scaling function used by the deep learning framework, ii incorporating the proposed adversarial clean image replica technique, and iii combining poison data selection criteria given constrained attacking budget. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MACAB exhibits more than 90% attack success rate under various real-world scenes. This includes both cloaking and misclassification backdoor effect even restricted with a small attack budget. The poisoned samples cannot be effectively identified by state-of-the-art detection techniques.The comprehensive video demo is at https://youtu.be/MA7L_LpXkp4, which is based on a poison rate of 0.14% for YOLOv4 cloaking backdoor and Faster R-CNN misclassification backdoor.

> We present a mechanism to manifest unobtainable secrets using a nested Shamir secret sharing scheme to create public/private key pairs for elliptic curves. A threshold secret sharing scheme can be used as a decentralised trust mechanism with applications in identity validation, message decryption, and agreement empowerment. Decentralising trust means that there is no single point vulnerability which could enable compromise of a system. Our primary interest is in twisted Edwards curves as used in EdDSA, and the related Diffie-Hellman key-exchange algorithms. The key generation is also decentralised, so can be used as a decentralised secret RNG suitable for use in other algorithms. The algorithms presented could be used to fill a ``[TBS]'' in the draft IETF specification ``Threshold modes in elliptic curves'' published in 2020 and updated in 2022.

> Pre-trained large language models, such as GPT\nobreakdash-2 and BERT, are often fine-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a downstream task. One natural example is the ``Smart Reply'' application where a pre-trained model is tuned to provide suggested responses for a given query message. Since the tuning data is often sensitive data such as emails or chat transcripts, it is important to understand and mitigate the risk that the model leaks its tuning data. We investigate potential information leakage vulnerabilities in a typical Smart Reply pipeline. We consider a realistic setting where the adversary can only interact with the underlying model through a front-end interface that constrains what types of queries can be sent to the model. Previous attacks do not work in these settings, but require the ability to send unconstrained queries directly to the model. Even when there are no constraints on the queries, previous attacks typically require thousands, or even millions, of queries to extract useful information, while our attacks can extract sensitive data in just a handful of queries. We introduce a new type of active extraction attack that exploits canonical patterns in text containing sensitive data. We show experimentally that it is possible for an adversary to extract sensitive user information present in the training data, even in realistic settings where all interactions with the model must go through a front-end that limits the types of queries. We explore potential mitigation strategies and demonstrate empirically how differential privacy appears to be a reasonably effective defense mechanism to such pattern extraction attacks.

- *Arezoo Rajabi, Surudhi Asokraj, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Jim Ritcey, Radha Poovendran*

- `2308.15673v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15673v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15673v2)

> Machine learning models that use deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. An adversary carrying out a backdoor attack embeds a predefined perturbation called a trigger into a small subset of input samples and trains the DNN such that the presence of the trigger in the input results in an adversary-desired output class. Such adversarial retraining however needs to ensure that outputs for inputs without the trigger remain unaffected and provide high classification accuracy on clean samples. In this paper, we propose MDTD, a Multi-Domain Trojan Detector for DNNs, which detects inputs containing a Trojan trigger at testing time. MDTD does not require knowledge of trigger-embedding strategy of the attacker and can be applied to a pre-trained DNN model with image, audio, or graph-based inputs. MDTD leverages an insight that input samples containing a Trojan trigger are located relatively farther away from a decision boundary than clean samples. MDTD estimates the distance to a decision boundary using adversarial learning methods and uses this distance to infer whether a test-time input sample is Trojaned or not. We evaluate MDTD against state-of-the-art Trojan detection methods across five widely used image-based datasets: CIFAR100, CIFAR10, GTSRB, SVHN, and Flowers102; four graph-based datasets: AIDS, WinMal, Toxicant, and COLLAB; and the SpeechCommand audio dataset. MDTD effectively identifies samples that contain different types of Trojan triggers. We evaluate MDTD against adaptive attacks where an adversary trains a robust DNN to increase (decrease) distance of benign (Trojan) inputs from a decision boundary.

> Malicious use of deepfakes leads to serious public concerns and reduces people's trust in digital media. Although effective deepfake detectors have been proposed, they are substantially vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To evaluate the detector's robustness, recent studies have explored various attacks. However, all existing attacks are limited to 2D image perturbations, which are hard to translate into real-world facial changes. In this paper, we propose adversarial head turn (AdvHeat), the first attempt at 3D adversarial face views against deepfake detectors, based on face view synthesis from a single-view fake image. Extensive experiments validate the vulnerability of various detectors to AdvHeat in realistic, black-box scenarios. For example, AdvHeat based on a simple random search yields a high attack success rate of 96.8% with 360 searching steps. When additional query access is allowed, we can further reduce the step budget to 50. Additional analyses demonstrate that AdvHeat is better than conventional attacks on both the cross-detector transferability and robustness to defenses. The adversarial images generated by AdvHeat are also shown to have natural looks. Our code, including that for generating a multi-view dataset consisting of 360 synthetic views for each of 1000 IDs from FaceForensics++, is available at https://github.com/twowwj/AdvHeaT.

> Since the burgeoning days of IoT, Mirai has been established as the canonical IoT botnet. Not long after the public release of its code, researchers found many Mirai variants compete with one another for many of the same vulnerable hosts. Over time, the myriad Mirai variants evolved to incorporate unique vulnerabilities, defenses, and regional concentrations. In this paper, we ask: have Mirai variants evolved to the point that they are fundamentally distinct? We answer this question by measuring two of the most popular Mirai descendants: Hajime and Mozi. To actively scan both botnets simultaneously, we developed a robust measurement infrastructure, BMS, and ran it for more than eight months. The resulting datasets show that these two popular botnets have diverged in their evolutions from their common ancestor in multiple ways: they have virtually no overlapping IP addresses, they exhibit different behavior to network events such as diurnal rate limiting in China, and more. Collectively, our results show that there is no longer one canonical IoT botnet. We discuss the implications of this finding for researchers and practitioners.

- *Philipp Straubinger, Gordon Fraser*

> Software is infamous for its poor quality and frequent occurrence of bugs. While there is no doubt that thorough testing is an appropriate answer to ensure sufficient quality, the poor state of software generally suggests that developers may not always engage as thoroughly with testing as they should. This observation aligns with the prevailing belief that developers simply do not like writing tests. In order to determine the truth of this belief, we conducted a comprehensive survey with 21 questions aimed at (1) assessing developers' current engagement with testing and (2) identifying factors influencing their inclination toward testing; that is, whether they would actually like to test more but are inhibited by their work environment, or whether they would really prefer to test even less if given the choice. Drawing on 284 responses from professional software developers, we uncover reasons that positively and negatively impact developers' motivation to test. Notably, reasons for motivation to write more tests encompass not only a general pursuit of software quality but also personal satisfaction. However, developers nevertheless perceive testing as mundane and tend to prioritize other tasks. One approach emerging from the responses to mitigate these negative factors is by providing better recognition for developers' testing efforts.

- *Sze Jue Yang, Quang Nguyen, Chee Seng Chan, Khoa D. Doan*

- `2308.16684v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16684v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16684v2)

> The vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks have recently threatened the trustworthiness of machine learning models in practical applications. Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does not require extensive knowledge to click on the "convert" or "save as" button while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%) poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.

> Automated Program Repair has attracted significant research in recent years, leading to diverse techniques that focus on two main directions: search-based and semantic-based program repair. The former techniques often face challenges due to the vast search space, resulting in difficulties in identifying correct solutions, while the latter approaches are constrained by the capabilities of the underlying semantic analyser, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we propose NEVERMORE, a novel learning-based mechanism inspired by the adversarial nature of bugs and fixes. NEVERMORE is built upon the Generative Adversarial Networks architecture and trained on historical bug fixes to generate repairs that closely mimic human-produced fixes. Our empirical evaluation on 500 real-world bugs demonstrates the effectiveness of NEVERMORE in bug-fixing, generating repairs that match human fixes for 21.2% of the examined bugs. Moreover, we evaluate NEVERMORE on the Defects4J dataset, where our approach generates repairs for 4 bugs that remained unresolved by state-of-the-art baselines. NEVERMORE also fixes another 8 bugs which were only resolved by a subset of these baselines. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the impact of input and training styles on NEVERMORE's performance, revealing where the chosen style influences the model's bug-fixing capabilities.

> A major approach for defending against adversarial attacks aims at controlling only image classifiers to be more resilient, and it does not care about visual objects, such as pandas and cars, in images. This means that visual objects themselves cannot take any defensive actions, and they are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In contrast, letters are artificial symbols, and we can freely control their appearance unless losing their readability. In other words, we can make the letters more defensive to the attacks. This paper poses three research questions related to the adversarial vulnerability of letter images: (1) How defensive are the letters against adversarial attacks? (2) Can we estimate how defensive a given letter image is before attacks? (3) Can we control the letter images to be more defensive against adversarial attacks? For answering the first and second questions, we measure the defensibility of letters by employing Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM) and then build a deep regression model for estimating the defensibility of each letter image. We also propose a two-step method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating character images with higher defensibility, which solves the third research question.

> Android Apps are frequently updated to keep up with changing user, hardware, and business demands. Ensuring the correctness of App updates through extensive testing is crucial to avoid potential bugs reaching the end user. Existing Android testing tools generate GUI events focussing on improving the test coverage of the entire App rather than prioritising updates and its impacted elements. Recent research has proposed change-focused testing but relies on random exploration to exercise the updates and impacted GUI elements that is ineffective and slow for large complex Apps with a huge input exploration space. We propose directed testing of App updates with Hawkeye that is able to prioritise executing GUI actions associated with code changes based on deep reinforcement learning from historical exploration data. Our empirical evaluation compares Hawkeye with state-of-the-art model-based and reinforcement learning-based testing tools FastBot2 and ARES using 10 popular open-source and 1 commercial App. We find that Hawkeye is able to generate GUI event sequences targeting changed functions more reliably than FastBot2 and ARES for the open source Apps and the large commercial App. Hawkeye achieves comparable performance on smaller open source Apps with a more tractable exploration space. The industrial deployment of Hawkeye in the development pipeline also shows that Hawkeye is ideal to perform smoke testing for merge requests of a complicated commercial App.

> With the boom of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research of solving Math Word Problem (MWP) has recently made great progress. However, there are few studies to examine the security of LLMs in math solving ability. Instead of attacking prompts in the use of LLMs, we propose a MathAttack model to attack MWP samples which are closer to the essence of security in solving math problems. Compared to traditional text adversarial attack, it is essential to preserve the mathematical logic of original MWPs during the attacking. To this end, we propose logical entity recognition to identify logical entries which are then frozen. Subsequently, the remaining text are attacked by adopting a word-level attacker. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset RobustMath to evaluate the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. Extensive experiments on our RobustMath and two another math benchmark datasets GSM8K and MultiAirth show that MathAttack could effectively attack the math solving ability of LLMs. In the experiments, we observe that (1) Our adversarial samples from higher-accuracy LLMs are also effective for attacking LLMs with lower accuracy (e.g., transfer from larger to smaller-size LLMs, or from few-shot to zero-shot prompts); (2) Complex MWPs (such as more solving steps, longer text, more numbers) are more vulnerable to attack; (3) We can improve the robustness of LLMs by using our adversarial samples in few-shot prompts. Finally, we hope our practice and observation can serve as an important attempt towards enhancing the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. We will release our code and dataset.

> This paper of work examines the SolarWinds attack, designed on Orion Platform security incident. It analyses the persistent threats agents and potential technical attack techniques to gain unauthorized access. In 2020 SolarWinds attack indicates an initial breach disclosure on Orion Platform software by malware distribution on IT and government organizations such as Homeland Security, Microsoft and Intel associated with supply chains leaks consequences from small loopholes in security systems. Hackers increased the number of infected company and businesses networks during the supply-chain attack, hackers were capable to propagate the attack by using a VMware exploit. On the special way they started to target command injections, privilege escalations, and use after free platforms of VMware. In this way, they gained access to Virtual Machines and in the east way pivot other servers. This literature review aim to analyze the security gap regarding to SolarWinds incident on Orion Platform, the impact on industry and financial sectors involving the elements of incident response plan. Therefore, this research paper ensures specifications of proper solutions for possible defense security systems by analyzing a SolarWinds attack case study via system evaluation and monitoring. It concludes with necessary remediation actions on cyber hygiene countermeasures, common vulnerabilities and exposure analysis and solutions.

> Deep Learning (DL) is prevalently used in various industries to improve decision-making and automate processes, driven by the ever-evolving DL libraries and compilers. The correctness of DL systems is crucial for trust in DL applications. As such, the recent wave of research has been studying the automated synthesis of test-cases (i.e., DNN models and their inputs) for fuzzing DL systems. However, existing model generators only subsume a limited number of operators, lacking the ability to pervasively model operator constraints. To address this challenge, we propose NeuRI, a fully automated approach for generating valid and diverse DL models composed of hundreds of types of operators. NeuRI adopts a three-step process: (i) collecting valid and invalid API traces from various sources; (ii) applying inductive program synthesis over the traces to infer the constraints for constructing valid models; and (iii) using hybrid model generation which incorporates both symbolic and concrete operators. Our evaluation shows that NeuRI improves branch coverage of TensorFlow and PyTorch by 24% and 15% over the state-of-the-art model-level fuzzers. NeuRI finds 100 new bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow in four months, with 81 already fixed or confirmed. Of these, 9 bugs are labelled as high priority or security vulnerability, constituting 10% of all high-priority bugs of the period. Open-source developers regard error-inducing tests reported by us as "high-quality" and "common in practice".

> As Large Language Models quickly become ubiquitous, it becomes critical to understand their security vulnerabilities. Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision?   We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples. And, the adversarial examples have transferability, which means that an adversarial example for a DNN model can fool another model with a non-trivial probability. This gave birth to the transfer-based attack where the adversarial examples generated by a surrogate model are used to conduct black-box attacks. There are some work on generating the adversarial examples from a given surrogate model with better transferability. However, training a special surrogate model to generate adversarial examples with better transferability is relatively under-explored. This paper proposes a method for training a surrogate model with dark knowledge to boost the transferability of the adversarial examples generated by the surrogate model. This trained surrogate model is named dark surrogate model (DSM). The proposed method for training a DSM consists of two key components: a teacher model extracting dark knowledge, and the mixing augmentation skill enhancing dark knowledge of training data. We conducted extensive experiments to show that the proposed method can substantially improve the adversarial transferability of surrogate models across different architectures of surrogate models and optimizers for generating adversarial examples, and it can be applied to other scenarios of transfer-based attack that contain dark knowledge, like face verification. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ydc123/Dark_Surrogate_Model}.

> The increasing reliance of software projects on third-party libraries has raised concerns about the security of these libraries due to hidden vulnerabilities. Managing these vulnerabilities is challenging due to the time gap between fixes and public disclosures. Moreover, a significant portion of open-source projects silently fix vulnerabilities without disclosure, impacting vulnerability management. Existing tools like OWASP heavily rely on public disclosures, hindering their effectiveness in detecting unknown vulnerabilities. To tackle this problem, automated identification of vulnerability-fixing commits has emerged. However, identifying silent vulnerability fixes remains challenging. This paper presents VFFINDER, a novel graph-based approach for automated silent vulnerability fix identification. VFFINDER captures structural changes using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and represents them in annotated ASTs. VFFINDER distinguishes vulnerability-fixing commits from non-fixing ones using attention-based graph neural network models to extract structural features. We conducted experiments to evaluate VFFINDER on a dataset of 36K+ fixing and non-fixing commits in 507 real-world C/C++ projects. Our results show that VFFINDER significantly improves the state-of-the-art methods by 39-83% in Precision, 19-148% in Recall, and 30-109% in F1. Especially, VFFINDER speeds up the silent fix identification process by up to 47% with the same review effort of 5% compared to the existing approaches.

> The rise in popularity of text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted widespread public interest. We demonstrate that this technology can be attacked to generate content that subtly manipulates its users. We propose a Backdoor Attack on text-to-image Generative Models (BAGM), which upon triggering, infuses the generated images with manipulative details that are naturally blended in the content. Our attack is the first to target three popular text-to-image generative models across three stages of the generative process by modifying the behaviour of the embedded tokenizer, the language model or the image generative model. Based on the penetration level, BAGM takes the form of a suite of attacks that are referred to as surface, shallow and deep attacks in this article. Given the existing gap within this domain, we also contribute a comprehensive set of quantitative metrics designed specifically for assessing the effectiveness of backdoor attacks on text-to-image models. The efficacy of BAGM is established by attacking state-of-the-art generative models, using a marketing scenario as the target domain. To that end, we contribute a dataset of branded product images.

> Machine learning (ML) models are known to be vulnerable to a number of attacks that target the integrity of their predictions or the privacy of their training data. To carry out these attacks, a black-box adversary must typically possess the ability to query the model and observe its outputs (e.g., labels). In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to enhance such decision-based attacks. To accomplish this, we present an approach that exploits a novel side channel in which the adversary simply measures the execution time of the algorithm used to post-process the predictions of the ML model under attack. The leakage of inference-state elements into algorithmic timing side channels has never been studied before, and we have found that it can contain rich information that facilitates superior timing attacks that significantly outperform attacks based solely on label outputs. In a case study, we investigate leakage from the non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm, which plays a crucial role in the operation of object detectors. In our examination of the timing side-channel vulnerabilities associated with this algorithm, we identified the potential to enhance decision-based attacks. We demonstrate attacks against the YOLOv3 detector, leveraging the timing leakage to successfully evade object detection using adversarial examples, and perform dataset inference. Our experiments show that our adversarial examples exhibit superior perturbation quality compared to a decision-based attack. In addition, we present a new threat model in which dataset inference based solely on timing leakage is performed. To address the timing leakage vulnerability inherent in the NMS algorithm, we explore the potential and limitations of implementing constant-time inference passes as a mitigation strategy.

> Code clones can detrimentally impact software maintenance and manually detecting them in very large codebases is impractical. Additionally, automated approaches find detection of Type 3 and Type 4 (inexact) clones very challenging. While the most recent artificial deep neural networks (for example BERT-based artificial neural networks) seem to be highly effective in detecting such clones, their pairwise comparison of every code pair in the target system(s) is inefficient and scales poorly on large codebases.   We therefore introduce SSCD, a BERT-based clone detection approach that targets high recall of Type 3 and Type 4 clones at scale (in line with our industrial partner's requirements). It does so by computing a representative embedding for each code fragment and finding similar fragments using a nearest neighbour search. SSCD thus avoids the pairwise-comparison bottleneck of other Neural Network approaches while also using parallel, GPU-accelerated search to tackle scalability.   This paper details the approach and an empirical assessment towards configuring and evaluating that approach in industrial setting. The configuration analysis suggests that shorter input lengths and text-only based neural network models demonstrate better efficiency in SSCD, while only slightly decreasing effectiveness. The evaluation results suggest that SSCD is more effective than state-of-the-art approaches like SAGA and SourcererCC. It is also highly efficient: in its optimal setting, SSCD effectively locates clones in the entire 320 million LOC BigCloneBench (a standard clone detection benchmark) in just under three hours.

> Due to the complexity of modern computer systems, novel and unexpected behaviors frequently occur. Such deviations are either normal occurrences, such as software updates and new user activities, or abnormalities, such as misconfigurations, latency issues, intrusions, and software bugs. Regardless, novel behaviors are of great interest to developers, and there is a genuine need for efficient and effective methods to detect them. Nowadays, researchers consider system calls to be the most fine-grained and accurate source of information to investigate the behavior of computer systems. Accordingly, this paper introduces a novelty detection methodology that relies on a probability distribution over sequences of system calls, which can be seen as a language model. Language models estimate the likelihood of sequences, and since novelties deviate from previously observed behaviors by definition, they would be unlikely under the model. Following the success of neural networks for language models, three architectures are evaluated in this work: the widespread LSTM, the state-of-the-art Transformer, and the lower-complexity Longformer. However, large neural networks typically require an enormous amount of data to be trained effectively, and to the best of our knowledge, no massive modern datasets of kernel traces are publicly available. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a new open-source dataset of kernel traces comprising over 2 million web requests with seven distinct behaviors. The proposed methodology requires minimal expert hand-crafting and achieves an F-score and AuROC greater than 95% on most novelties while being data- and task-agnostic. The source code and trained models are publicly available on GitHub while the datasets are available on Zenodo.

> Watermarking is a promising active diagnosis technique for detection of highly sophisticated attacks, but is vulnerable to malicious agents that use eavesdropped data to identify and then remove or replicate the watermark. In this work, we propose a hybrid multiplicative watermarking (HMWM) scheme, where the watermark parameters are periodically updated, following the dynamics of the unobservable states of specifically designed piecewise affine (PWA) hybrid systems. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effects of this scheme on the closed-loop performance, and prove that stability properties are preserved. Additionally, we show that the proposed approach makes it difficult for an eavesdropper to reconstruct the watermarking parameters, both in terms of the associated computational complexity and from a systems theoretic perspective.

> Mutation testing is a powerful technique for assessing and improving test suite quality that artificially introduces bugs and checks whether the test suites catch them. However, it is also computationally expensive and thus does not scale to large systems and projects. One promising recent approach to tackling this scalability problem uses machine learning to predict whether the tests will detect the synthetic bugs, without actually running those tests. However, existing predictive mutation testing approaches still misclassify 33% of detection outcomes on a randomly sampled set of mutant-test suite pairs. We introduce MutationBERT, an approach for predictive mutation testing that simultaneously encodes the source method mutation and test method, capturing key context in the input representation. Thanks to its higher precision, MutationBERT saves 33% of the time spent by a prior approach on checking/verifying live mutants. MutationBERT, also outperforms the state-of-the-art in both same project and cross project settings, with meaningful improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score. We validate our input representation, and aggregation approaches for lifting predictions from the test matrix level to the test suite level, finding similar improvements in performance. MutationBERT not only enhances the state-of-the-art in predictive mutation testing, but also presents practical benefits for real-world applications, both in saving developer time and finding hard to detect mutants.

> Signed graphs are well-suited for modeling social networks as they capture both positive and negative relationships. Signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) are commonly employed to predict link signs (i.e., positive and negative) in such graphs due to their ability to handle the unique structure of signed graphs. However, real-world signed graphs are vulnerable to malicious attacks by manipulating edge relationships, and existing adversarial graph attack methods do not consider the specific structure of signed graphs. SGNNs often incorporate balance theory to effectively model the positive and negative links. Surprisingly, we find that the balance theory that they rely on can ironically be exploited as a black-box attack. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box attack called balance-attack that aims to decrease the balance degree of the signed graphs. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this NP-hard optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on five popular SGNN models and four real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of our proposed attack method. By addressing these challenges, our research contributes to a better understanding of the limitations and resilience of robust models when facing attacks on SGNNs. This work contributes to enhancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social network modeling. Our PyTorch implementation of the attack is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/JialongZhou666/Balance-Attack.git.

> Recent work has connected adversarial attack methods and algorithmic recourse methods: both seek minimal changes to an input instance which alter a model's classification decision. It has been shown that traditional adversarial training, which seeks to minimize a classifier's susceptibility to malicious perturbations, increases the cost of generated recourse; with larger adversarial training radii correlating with higher recourse costs. From the perspective of algorithmic recourse, however, the appropriate adversarial training radius has always been unknown. Another recent line of work has motivated adversarial training with adaptive training radii to address the issue of instance-wise variable adversarial vulnerability, showing success in domains with unknown attack radii. This work studies the effects of adaptive adversarial training on algorithmic recourse costs. We establish that the improvements in model robustness induced by adaptive adversarial training show little effect on algorithmic recourse costs, providing a potential avenue for affordable robustness in domains where recoursability is critical.

> High frequency reporting of energy consumption data in smart grids can be used to infer sensitive information regarding the consumer's life style and poses serious security and privacy threats. Differential privacy (DP) based privacy models for smart grids ensure privacy when analysing energy consumption data for billing and load monitoring. However, DP models for smart grids are vulnerable to collusion attack where an adversary colludes with malicious smart meters and un-trusted aggregator in order to get private information from other smart meters. We first show the vulnerability of DP based privacy model for smart grids against collusion attacks to establish the need of a collusion resistant model privacy model. Then, we propose an Enhanced Differential Private Noise Cancellation Model for Load Monitoring and Billing for Smart Meters (E-DPNCT) which not only provides resistance against collusion attacks but also protects the privacy of the smart grid data while providing accurate billing and load monitoring. We use differential privacy with a split noise cancellation protocol with multiple master smart meters (MSMs) to achieve colluison resistance. We did extensive comparison of our E-DPNCT model with state of the art attack resistant privacy preserving models such as EPIC for collusion attack. We simulate our E-DPNCT model with real time data which shows significant improvement in privacy attack scenarios. Further, we analyze the impact of selecting different sensitivity parameters for calibrating DP noise over the privacy of customer electricity profile and accuracy of electricity data aggregation such as load monitoring and billing.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in the task of graph classification and its diverse downstream real-world applications. Despite the huge success in learning graph representations, current GNN models have demonstrated their vulnerability to potentially existent adversarial examples on graph-structured data. Existing approaches are either limited to structure attacks or restricted to local information, urging for the design of a more general attack framework on graph classification, which faces significant challenges due to the complexity of generating local-node-level adversarial examples using the global-graph-level information. To address this "global-to-local" attack challenge, we present a novel and general framework to generate adversarial examples via manipulating graph structure and node features. Specifically, we make use of Graph Class Activation Mapping and its variant to produce node-level importance corresponding to the graph classification task. Then through a heuristic design of algorithms, we can perform both feature and structure attacks under unnoticeable perturbation budgets with the help of both node-level and subgraph-level importance. Experiments towards attacking four state-of-the-art graph classification models on six real-world benchmarks verify the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework.

> Cryptographic key exchange protocols traditionally rely on computational conjectures such as the hardness of prime factorisation to provide security against eavesdropping attacks. Remarkably, quantum key distribution protocols like the one proposed by Bennett and Brassard provide information-theoretic security against such attacks, a much stronger form of security unreachable by classical means. However, quantum protocols realised so far are subject to a new class of attacks exploiting implementation defects in the physical devices involved, as demonstrated in numerous ingenious experiments. Following the pioneering work of Ekert proposing the use of entanglement to bound an adversary's information from Bell's theorem, we present here the experimental realisation of a complete quantum key distribution protocol immune to these vulnerabilities. We achieve this by combining theoretical developments on finite-statistics analysis, error correction, and privacy amplification, with an event-ready scheme enabling the rapid generation of high-fidelity entanglement between two trapped-ion qubits connected by an optical fibre link. The secrecy of our key is guaranteed device-independently: it is based on the validity of quantum theory, and certified by measurement statistics observed during the experiment. Our result shows that provably secure cryptography with real-world devices is possible, and paves the way for further quantum information applications based on the device-independence principle.

> Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) leverages AI approaches to handle the massive amount of data generated during the operations of software systems. Prior works have proposed various AIOps solutions to support different tasks in system operations and maintenance, such as anomaly detection. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of open-source AIOps projects to understand the characteristics of AIOps in practice. We first carefully identify a set of AIOps projects from GitHub and analyze their repository metrics (e.g., the used programming languages). Then, we qualitatively examine the projects to understand their input data, analysis techniques, and goals. Finally, we assess the quality of these projects using different quality metrics, such as the number of bugs. To provide context, we also sample two sets of baseline projects from GitHub: a random sample of machine learning projects and a random sample of general-purposed projects. By comparing different metrics between our identified AIOps projects and these baselines, we derive meaningful insights. Our results reveal a recent and growing interest in AIOps solutions. However, the quality metrics indicate that AIOps projects suffer from more issues than our baseline projects. We also pinpoint the most common issues in AIOps approaches and discuss potential solutions to address these challenges. Our findings offer valuable guidance to researchers and practitioners, enabling them to comprehend the current state of AIOps practices and shed light on different ways of improving AIOps' weaker aspects. To the best of our knowledge, this work marks the first attempt to characterize open-source AIOps projects.

> Given the exponential expansion of the internet, the possibilities of security attacks and cybercrimes have increased accordingly. However, poorly implemented security mechanisms in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices make them susceptible to cyberattacks, which can directly affect users. IoT forensics is thus needed for investigating and mitigating such attacks. While many works have examined IoT applications and challenges, only a few have focused on both the forensic and security issues in IoT. Therefore, this paper reviews forensic and security issues associated with IoT in different fields. Future prospects and challenges in IoT research and development are also highlighted. As demonstrated in the literature, most IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of standardized security measures. Unauthorized users could get access, compromise data, and even benefit from control of critical infrastructure. To fulfil the security-conscious needs of consumers, IoT can be used to develop a smart home system by designing a FLIP-based system that is highly scalable and adaptable. Utilizing a blockchain-based authentication mechanism with a multi-chain structure can provide additional security protection between different trust domains. Deep learning can be utilized to develop a network forensics framework with a high-performing system for detecting and tracking cyberattack incidents. Moreover, researchers should consider limiting the amount of data created and delivered when using big data to develop IoT-based smart systems. The findings of this review will stimulate academics to seek potential solutions for the identified issues, thereby advancing the IoT field.

> Time series classification (TSC) has emerged as a critical task in various domains, and deep neural models have shown superior performance in TSC tasks. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations can significantly impact the prediction results. Existing adversarial methods often suffer from over-parameterization or random logit perturbation, hindering their effectiveness. Additionally, increasing the attack success rate (ASR) typically involves generating more noise, making the attack more easily detectable. To address these limitations, we propose SWAP, a novel attacking method for TSC models. SWAP focuses on enhancing the confidence of the second-ranked logits while minimizing the manipulation of other logits. This is achieved by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target logit distribution and the predictive logit distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that SWAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an ASR exceeding 50% and an 18% increase compared to existing methods.

> This paper addresses a critical challenge in cybersecurity: the gap between vulnerability information represented by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and the resulting cyberattack actions. CVEs provide insights into vulnerabilities, but often lack details on potential threat actions (tactics, techniques, and procedures, or TTPs) within the ATT&CK framework. This gap hinders accurate CVE categorization and proactive countermeasure initiation. The paper introduces the TTPpredictor tool, which uses innovative techniques to analyze CVE descriptions and infer plausible TTP attacks resulting from CVE exploitation. TTPpredictor overcomes challenges posed by limited labeled data and semantic disparities between CVE and TTP descriptions. It initially extracts threat actions from unstructured cyber threat reports using Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) techniques. These actions, along with their contextual attributes, are correlated with MITRE's attack functionality classes. This automated correlation facilitates the creation of labeled data, essential for categorizing novel threat actions into threat functionality classes and TTPs. The paper presents an empirical assessment, demonstrating TTPpredictor's effectiveness with accuracy rates of approximately 98% and F1-scores ranging from 95% to 98% in precise CVE classification to ATT&CK techniques. TTPpredictor outperforms state-of-the-art language model tools like ChatGPT. Overall, this paper offers a robust solution for linking CVEs to potential attack techniques, enhancing cybersecurity practitioners' ability to proactively identify and mitigate threats.

> Most seismic risk assessment methods focus on estimating the damages to the built environment and the consequent socioeconomic losses without fully taking into account the social aspect of risk. Yet, human behaviour is a key element in predicting the human impact of an earthquake, therefore, it is important to include it in quantitative risk assessment studies. In this study, an interdisciplinary approach simulating pedestrians' evacuation during earthquakes at the city scale is developed using an agent-based model. The model integrates the seismic hazard, the physical vulnerability as well as individuals' behaviours and mobility. The simulator is applied to the case of Beirut, Lebanon. Lebanon is at the heart of the Levant fault system that has generated several Mw>7 earthquakes, the latest being in 1759. It is one of the countries with the highest seismic risk in the Mediterranean region. This is due to the high seismic vulnerability of the buildings due to the absence of mandatory seismic regulation until 2012, the high level of urbanization, and the lack of adequate spatial planning and risk prevention policies. Beirut as the main residential, economic and institutional hub of Lebanon is densely populated. To accommodate the growing need for urban development, constructions have almost taken over all of the green areas of the city; squares and gardens are disappearing to give place to skyscrapers. However, open spaces are safe places to shelter, away from debris, and therefore play an essential role in earthquake evacuation. Despite the massive urbanization, there are a few open spaces but locked gates and other types of anthropogenic barriers often limit their access. To simulate this complex context, pedestrians' evacuation simulations are run in a highly realistic spatial environment implemented in GAMA [1]. Previous data concerning soil and buildings in Beirut [2, 3] are complemented by new geographic data extracted from high-resolution Pleiades satellite images. The seismic loading is defined as a peak ground acceleration of 0.3g, as stated in Lebanese seismic regulations. Building damages are estimated using an artificial neural network trained to predict the mean damage [4] based on the seismic loading as well as the soil and building vibrational properties [5]. Moreover, the quantity and the footprint of the generated debris around each building are also estimated and included in the model. We simulate how topography, buildings, debris, and access to open spaces, affect individuals' mobility. Two city configurations are implemented: 1. Open spaces are accessible without any barriers; 2. Access to some open spaces is blocked. The first simulation results show that while 52% of the population is able to arrive to an open space within 5 minutes after an earthquake, this number is reduced to 39% when one of the open spaces is locked. These results show that the presence of accessible open spaces in a city and their proximity to the residential buildings is a crucial factor for ensuring people's safety when an earthquake occurs.

> Geographical location is a crucial element of humanitarian response, outlining vulnerable populations, ongoing events, and available resources. Latest developments in Natural Language Processing may help in extracting vital information from the deluge of reports and documents produced by the humanitarian sector. However, the performance and biases of existing state-of-the-art information extraction tools are unknown. In this work, we develop annotated resources to fine-tune the popular Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools Spacy and roBERTa to perform geotagging of humanitarian texts. We then propose a geocoding method FeatureRank which links the candidate locations to the GeoNames database. We find that not only does the humanitarian-domain data improves the performance of the classifiers (up to F1 = 0.92), but it also alleviates some of the bias of the existing tools, which erroneously favor locations in the Western countries. Thus, we conclude that more resources from non-Western documents are necessary to ensure that off-the-shelf NER systems are suitable for the deployment in the humanitarian sector.

> The widespread adoption of the Android operating system has made malicious Android applications an appealing target for attackers. Machine learning-based (ML-based) Android malware detection (AMD) methods are crucial in addressing this problem; however, their vulnerability to adversarial examples raises concerns. Current attacks against ML-based AMD methods demonstrate remarkable performance but rely on strong assumptions that may not be realistic in real-world scenarios, e.g., the knowledge requirements about feature space, model parameters, and training dataset. To address this limitation, we introduce AdvDroidZero, an efficient query-based attack framework against ML-based AMD methods that operates under the zero knowledge setting. Our extensive evaluation shows that AdvDroidZero is effective against various mainstream ML-based AMD methods, in particular, state-of-the-art such methods and real-world antivirus solutions.

> The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are pivotal information for proactive cybersecurity measures, including service patching, security hardening, and more. However, CVEs typically offer low-level, product-oriented descriptions of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, often lacking the essential attack semantic information required for comprehensive weakness characterization and threat impact estimation. This critical insight is essential for CVE prioritization and the identification of potential countermeasures, particularly when dealing with a large number of CVEs. Current industry practices involve manual evaluation of CVEs to assess their attack severities using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and mapping them to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for potential mitigation identification. Unfortunately, this manual analysis presents a major bottleneck in the vulnerability analysis process, leading to slowdowns in proactive cybersecurity efforts and the potential for inaccuracies due to human errors. In this research, we introduce our novel predictive model and tool (called CVEDrill) which revolutionizes CVE analysis and threat prioritization. CVEDrill accurately estimates the CVSS vector for precise threat mitigation and priority ranking and seamlessly automates the classification of CVEs into the appropriate CWE hierarchy classes. By harnessing CVEDrill, organizations can now implement cybersecurity countermeasure mitigation with unparalleled accuracy and timeliness, surpassing in this domain the capabilities of state-of-the-art tools like ChaptGPT.

> In the past couple of decades, significant research efforts are devoted to the prediction of software bugs. However, most existing work in this domain treats all bugs the same, which is not the case in practice. It is important for a defect prediction method to estimate the severity of the identified bugs so that the higher-severity ones get immediate attention. In this study, we investigate source code metrics, source code representation using large language models (LLMs), and their combination in predicting bug severity labels of two prominent datasets. We leverage several source metrics at method-level granularity to train eight different machine-learning models. Our results suggest that Decision Tree and Random Forest models outperform other models regarding our several evaluation metrics. We then use the pre-trained CodeBERT LLM to study the source code representations' effectiveness in predicting bug severity. CodeBERT finetuning improves the bug severity prediction results significantly in the range of 29%-140% for several evaluation metrics, compared to the best classic prediction model on source code metric. Finally, we integrate source code metrics into CodeBERT as an additional input, using our two proposed architectures, which both enhance the CodeBERT model effectiveness.

> Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is emerging as a peer-to-peer financial ecosystem, enabling participants to trade products on a permissionless blockchain. Built on blockchain and smart contracts, the DeFi ecosystem has experienced explosive growth in recent years. Unfortunately, smart contracts hold a massive amount of value, making them an attractive target for attacks. So far, attacks against smart contracts and DeFi protocols have resulted in billions of dollars in financial losses, severely threatening the security of the entire DeFi ecosystem. Researchers have proposed various security tools for smart contracts and DeFi protocols as countermeasures. However, a comprehensive investigation of these efforts is still lacking, leaving a crucial gap in our understanding of how to enhance the security posture of the smart contract and DeFi landscape.   To fill the gap, this paper reviews the progress made in the field of smart contract and DeFi security from the perspective of both vulnerability detection and automated repair. First, we analyze the DeFi smart contract security issues and challenges. Specifically, we lucubrate various DeFi attack incidents and summarize the attacks into six categories. Then, we present an empirical study of 42 state-of-the-art techniques that can detect smart contract and DeFi vulnerabilities. In particular, we evaluate the effectiveness of traditional smart contract bug detection tools in analyzing complex DeFi protocols. Additionally, we investigate 8 existing automated repair tools for smart contracts and DeFi protocols, providing insight into their advantages and disadvantages. To make this work useful for as wide of an audience as possible, we also identify several open issues and challenges in the DeFi ecosystem that should be addressed in the future.

> The rapid proliferation of AI-generated text online is profoundly reshaping the information landscape. Among various types of AI-generated text, AI-generated news presents a significant threat as it can be a prominent source of misinformation online. While several recent efforts have focused on detecting AI-generated text in general, these methods require enhanced reliability, given concerns about their vulnerability to simple adversarial attacks. Furthermore, due to the eccentricities of news writing, applying these detection methods for AI-generated news can produce false positives, potentially damaging the reputation of news organizations. To address these challenges, we leverage the expertise of an interdisciplinary team to develop a framework, J-Guard, capable of steering existing supervised AI text detectors for detecting AI-generated news while boosting adversarial robustness. By incorporating stylistic cues inspired by the unique journalistic attributes, J-Guard effectively distinguishes between real-world journalism and AI-generated news articles. Our experiments on news articles generated by a vast array of AI models, including ChatGPT (GPT3.5), demonstrate the effectiveness of J-Guard in enhancing detection capabilities while maintaining an average performance decrease of as low as 7% when faced with adversarial attacks.

> Code review is a fundamental process in software development that plays a critical role in ensuring code quality and reducing the likelihood of errors and bugs. However, code review might be complex, subjective, and time-consuming. Comment generation and code refinement are two key tasks of this process and their automation has traditionally been addressed separately in the literature using different approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning architecture, DISCOREV, based on cross-task knowledge distillation that addresses these two tasks simultaneously. In our approach, the fine-tuning of the comment generation model is guided by the code refinement model. We implemented this guidance using two strategies, feedback-based learning objective and embedding alignment objective. We evaluated our approach based on cross-task knowledge distillation by comparing it to the state-of-the-art methods that are based on independent training and fine-tuning. Our results show that our approach generates better review comments as measured by the BLEU score.

> A new class of vulnerabilities related to speculative and out-of-order execution, fault-injection, and microarchitectural side channels rose to attention in 2018. The techniques behind the transient execution vulnerabilities were not new, but the combined application of the techniques was more sophisticated, and the security impact more severe, than previously considered possible. Numerous mitigations have been proposed and implemented for variants of the transient execution vulnerabilities. While Meltdown-type exception-based transient execution vulnerabilities have proven to be tractable, Spectre-type vulnerabilities and other speculation-based transient execution vulnerabilities have been far more resistant to countermeasures. A few proposed mitigations have been widely adopted by hardware vendors and software developers, but combining those commonly deployed mitigations does not produce an effective and comprehensive solution, it only protects against a small subset of the variants. Over the years, newly proposed mitigations have been trending towards more effective and comprehensive approaches with better performance, and yet, older mitigations remain the most popular despite limited security benefits and prohibitive performance penalties. If we continue this way, we can look forward to many generations of hardware debilitated by performance penalties from increasing layers of mitigations as new variants are discovered, and yet still vulnerable to both known and future variants.

- *Chin Khor, Robyn Lutz*

- `2309.03392v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03392v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03392v1)

> Variability constraints are an integral part of the requirements for a configurable system. The constraints specified in the requirements on the legal combinations of options define the space of potential valid configurations for the system-to-be. This paper reports on our experience with the variability-related requirements constraints of a flight software framework used by multiple space missions. A challenge that we saw for practitioners using the current framework, now open-sourced, is that the specifications of its variability-related requirements and constraints are dispersed across several documents, rather than being centralized in the software requirements specification. Such dispersion can contribute to misunderstandings of the side-effects of design choices, increased effort for developers, and bugs during operations. Based on our experience, we propose a new software variability model, similar to a product-line feature model, in the flight software framework. We describe the structured technique by which our model is developed, demonstrate its use, and evaluate it on a key service module of the flight software. Results show that our lightweight modeling technique helped find missing and inconsistent variability-related requirements and constraints. More generally, we suggest that a variability modeling technique such as this can be an efficient way for developers to centralize the specification and improve the analysis of dispersed variability-related requirements and constraints in other configurable systems.

> Defects, or bugs, often form during software development. Identifying the root cause of defects is essential to improve code quality, evaluate testing methods, and support defect prediction. Examples of defect-inducing changes can be found using the SZZ algorithm to trace the textual history of defect-fixing changes back to the defect-inducing changes that they fix in line-based code. The line-based approach of the SZZ method is ineffective for visual code that represents source code graphically rather than textually. In this paper we adapt SZZ for visual code and present the "SZZ Visual Code" (SZZ-VC) algorithm, that finds changes in visual code based on the differences of graphical elements rather than differences of lines to detect defect-inducing changes. We validated the algorithm for an industry-made AAA video game and 20 music visual programming defects across 12 open source projects. Our results show that SZZ-VC is feasible for detecting defects in visual code for 3 different visual programming languages.

> Federated learning (FL) is designed to preserve data privacy during model training, where the data remains on the client side (i.e., IoT devices), and only model updates of clients are shared iteratively for collaborative learning. However, this process is vulnerable to privacy attacks and Byzantine attacks: the local model updates shared throughout the FL network will leak private information about the local training data, and they can also be maliciously crafted by Byzantine attackers to disturb the learning. In this paper, we propose a new FL scheme that guarantees rigorous privacy and simultaneously enhances system robustness against Byzantine attacks. Our approach introduces sparsification- and momentum-driven variance reduction into the client-level differential privacy (DP) mechanism, to defend against Byzantine attackers. The security design does not violate the privacy guarantee of the client-level DP mechanism; hence, our approach achieves the same client-level DP guarantee as the state-of-the-art. We conduct extensive experiments on both IID and non-IID datasets and different tasks and evaluate the performance of our approach against different Byzantine attacks by comparing it with state-of-the-art defense methods. The results of our experiments show the efficacy of our framework and demonstrate its ability to improve system robustness against Byzantine attacks while achieving a strong privacy guarantee.

> I explore two questions in this thesis: how can computer science be used to fight human trafficking? And how can computer vision create a sense of touch?   I use natural language processing (NLP) to monitor the United States illicit massage industry (IMI), a multi-billion dollar industry that offers not just therapeutic massages but also commercial sexual services. Employees of this industry are often immigrant women with few job opportunities, leaving them vulnerable to fraud, coercion, and other facets of human trafficking. Monitoring spatiotemporal trends helps prevent trafficking in the IMI. By creating datasets with three publicly-accessible websites: Google Places, Rubmaps, and AMPReviews, combined with NLP techniques such as bag-of-words and Word2Vec, I show how to derive insights into the labor pressures and language barriers that employees face, as well as the income, demographics, and societal pressures affecting sex buyers. I include a call-to-action to other researchers given these datasets. I also consider how to creating synthetic financial data, which can aid with counter-trafficking in the banking sector. I use an agent-based model to create both tabular and payee-recipient graph data.   I then consider the role of computer vision in making tactile sensors. I report on a novel sensor, the Digger Finger, that adapts the Gelsight sensor to finding objects in granular media. Changes include using a wedge shape to facilitate digging, replacing the internal lighting LEDs with fluorescent paint, and adding a vibrator motor to counteract jamming. Finally, I also show how to use a webcam and a printed reference marker, or fiducial, to create a low-cost six-axis force-torque sensor. This sensor is up to a hundred times less expensive than commercial sensors, allowing for a wider range of applications. For this and earlier chapters I release design files and code as open source.

> Despite the fact that the state-of-the-art fuzzers can generate inputs efficiently, existing fuzz drivers still cannot adequately cover entries in libraries. Most of these fuzz drivers are crafted manually by developers, and their quality depends on the developers' understanding of the code. Existing works have attempted to automate the generation of fuzz drivers by learning API usage from code and execution traces. However, the generated fuzz drivers are limited to a few specific call sequences by the code being learned. To address these challenges, we present HOPPER, which can fuzz libraries without requiring any domain knowledge to craft fuzz drivers. It transforms the problem of library fuzzing into the problem of interpreter fuzzing. The interpreters linked against libraries under test can interpret the inputs that describe arbitrary API usage. To generate semantically correct inputs for the interpreter, HOPPER learns the intra- and inter-API constraints in the libraries and mutates the program with grammar awareness. We implemented HOPPER and evaluated its effectiveness on 11 real-world libraries against manually crafted fuzzers and other automatic solutions. Our results show that HOPPER greatly outperformed the other fuzzers in both code coverage and bug finding, having uncovered 25 previously unknown bugs that other fuzzers couldn't. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the proposed intra- and inter-API constraint learning methods can correctly learn constraints implied by the library and, therefore, significantly improve the fuzzing efficiency. The experiment results indicate that HOPPER is able to explore a vast range of API usages for library fuzzing out of the box.

The susceptibility of machine learning models to minor input perturbations renders them vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful in learning rich network representations that aid the performance of downstream tasks. However, recent studies showed that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks involving node injection and network perturbation. Among these, node injection attacks are more practical as they don't require manipulation in the existing network and can be performed more realistically. In this paper, we propose a novel problem statement - a class-specific poison attack on graphs in which the attacker aims to misclassify specific nodes in the target class into a different class using node injection. Additionally, nodes are injected in such a way that they camouflage as benign nodes. We propose NICKI, a novel attacking strategy that utilizes an optimization-based approach to sabotage the performance of GNN-based node classifiers. NICKI works in two phases - it first learns the node representation and then generates the features and edges of the injected nodes. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four benchmark networks show that NICKI is consistently better than four baseline attacking strategies for misclassifying nodes in the target class. We also show that the injected nodes are properly camouflaged as benign, thus making the poisoned graph indistinguishable from its clean version w.r.t various topological properties.

> The severity of recent vulnerabilities discovered on modern CPUs, e.g., Spectre [1], highlights how information leakage can have devas-tating effects to the security of computer systems. At the same time, it suggests that confidentiality should be promoted as a normal part of program verification, to discover and mitigate such vulnerabili-ties early in development. The theory we propose is primarily based on Bank's theory [2], a framework for reasoning about confidentiali-ty properties formalised in the Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) [3]. We mechanised our encoding in the current implementa-tion of UTP in the Isabelle theorem prover, Isabelle/UTP [4]. We have identified some theoretical issues in Bank's original framework. Finally, we demonstrate how our mechanisation can be used to for-mally verify of some of the examples from Bank's work.

> Real-world graphs naturally exhibit hierarchical or cyclical structures that are unfit for the typical Euclidean space. While there exist graph neural networks that leverage hyperbolic or spherical spaces to learn representations that embed such structures more accurately, these methods are confined under the message-passing paradigm, making the models vulnerable against side-effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing. More recent work have proposed global attention-based graph Transformers that can easily model long-range interactions, but their extensions towards non-Euclidean geometry are yet unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Fully Product-Stereographic Transformer, a generalization of Transformers towards operating entirely on the product of constant curvature spaces. When combined with tokenized graph Transformers, our model can learn the curvature appropriate for the input graph in an end-to-end fashion, without the need of additional tuning on different curvature initializations. We also provide a kernelized approach to non-Euclidean attention, which enables our model to run in time and memory cost linear to the number of nodes and edges while respecting the underlying geometry. Experiments on graph reconstruction and node classification demonstrate the benefits of generalizing Transformers to the non-Euclidean domain.

> Many large-scale distributed multi-agent systems exchange information over low-power communication networks. In particular, agents intermittently communicate state and control signals in robotic network applications, often with limited power over an unlicensed spectrum, prone to eavesdropping and denial-of-service attacks. In this paper, we argue that a widely popular low-power communication protocol known as LoRa is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks by an unauthenticated attacker if it can successfully identify a target signal's bandwidth and spreading factor. Leveraging a structural pattern in the LoRa signal's instantaneous frequency representation, we relate the problem of jointly inferring the two unknown parameters to a classification problem, which can be efficiently implemented using neural networks.

> This paper provides the first systematic analysis of a synergistic threat model encompassing memory corruption vulnerabilities and microarchitectural side-channel vulnerabilities. We study speculative shield bypass attacks that leverage speculative execution attacks to leak secrets that are critical to the security of memory corruption mitigations (i.e., the shields), and then use the leaked secrets to bypass the mitigation mechanisms and successfully conduct memory corruption exploits, such as control-flow hijacking. We start by systematizing a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art memory corruption mitigations focusing on hardware-software co-design solutions. The taxonomy helps us to identify 10 likely vulnerable defense schemes out of 20 schemes that we analyze. Next, we develop a graph-based model to analyze the 10 likely vulnerable defenses and reason about possible countermeasures. Finally, we present three proof-of-concept attacks targeting an already-deployed mitigation mechanism and two state-of-the-art academic proposals.

> Federated Learning (FL) facilitates decentralized machine learning model training, preserving data privacy, lowering communication costs, and boosting model performance through diversified data sources. Yet, FL faces vulnerabilities such as poisoning attacks, undermining model integrity with both untargeted performance degradation and targeted backdoor attacks. Preventing backdoors proves especially challenging due to their stealthy nature.   Prominent mitigation techniques against poisoning attacks rely on monitoring certain metrics and filtering malicious model updates. While shown effective in evaluations, we argue that previous works didn't consider realistic real-world adversaries and data distributions. We define a new notion of strong adaptive adversaries, capable of adapting to multiple objectives simultaneously. Through extensive empirical tests, we show that existing defense methods can be easily circumvented in this adversary model. We also demonstrate, that existing defenses have limited effectiveness when no assumptions are made about underlying data distributions.   We introduce Metric-Cascades (MESAS), a novel defense method for more realistic scenarios and adversary models. MESAS employs multiple detection metrics simultaneously to identify poisoned model updates, creating a complex multi-objective optimization problem for adaptive attackers. In our extensive evaluation featuring nine backdoors and three datasets, MESAS consistently detects even strong adaptive attackers. Furthermore, MESAS outperforms existing defenses in distinguishing backdoors from data distribution-related distortions within and across clients. MESAS is the first defense robust against strong adaptive adversaries, effective in real-world data scenarios, with an average overhead of just 24.37 seconds.

> We consider the exploration-exploitation dilemma in finite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL). When the state space is large or continuous, traditional tabular approaches are unfeasible and some form of function approximation is mandatory. In this paper, we introduce an optimistically-initialized variant of the popular randomized least-squares value iteration (RLSVI), a model-free algorithm where exploration is induced by perturbing the least-squares approximation of the action-value function. Under the assumption that the Markov decision process has low-rank transition dynamics, we prove that the frequentist regret of RLSVI is upper-bounded by $\widetilde O(d^2 H^2 \sqrt{T})$ where $ d $ are the feature dimension, $ H $ is the horizon, and $ T $ is the total number of steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first frequentist regret analysis for randomized exploration with function approximation.

> Sharding is a prominent technique for scaling blockchains. By dividing the network into smaller components known as shards, a sharded blockchain can process transactions in parallel without introducing inconsistencies through the coordination of intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols. However, we observe a critical security issue with sharded systems: transaction ordering manipulations can occur when coordinating intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols, leaving the system vulnerable to attack. Specifically, we identify a novel security issue known as finalization fairness, which can be exploited through a front-running attack. This attack allows an attacker to manipulate the execution order of transactions, even if the victim's transaction has already been processed and added to the blockchain by a fair intra-shard consensus.   To address the issue, we offer Haechi, a novel cross-shard protocol that is immune to front-running attacks. Haechi introduces an ordering phase between transaction processing and execution, ensuring that the execution order of transactions is the same as the processing order and achieving finalization fairness. To accommodate different consensus speeds among shards, Haechi incorporates a finalization fairness algorithm to achieve a globally fair order with minimal performance loss. By providing a global order, Haechi ensures strong consistency among shards, enabling better parallelism in handling conflicting transactions across shards. These features make Haechi a promising solution for supporting popular smart contracts in the real world. To evaluate Haechi's performance, we implemented the protocol using Tendermint and conducted extensive experiments on a geo-distributed AWS environment. Our results demonstrate that Haechi achieves finalization fairness with little performance sacrifice compared to existing cross-shard consensus protocols.

> Deep neural networks are valuable assets considering their commercial benefits and huge demands for costly annotation and computation resources. To protect the copyright of DNNs, backdoor-based ownership verification becomes popular recently, in which the model owner can watermark the model by embedding a specific backdoor behavior before releasing it. The defenders (usually the model owners) can identify whether a suspicious third-party model is ``stolen'' from them based on the presence of the behavior. Unfortunately, these watermarks are proven to be vulnerable to removal attacks even like fine-tuning. To further explore this vulnerability, we investigate the parameter space and find there exist many watermark-removed models in the vicinity of the watermarked one, which may be easily used by removal attacks. Inspired by this finding, we propose a mini-max formulation to find these watermark-removed models and recover their watermark behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves the robustness of the model watermarking against parametric changes and numerous watermark-removal attacks. The codes for reproducing our main experiments are available at \url{https://github.com/GuanhaoGan/robust-model-watermarking}.

> Trade disruptions, the pandemic, and the Ukraine war over the past years have adversely affected global supply chains, revealing their vulnerability. Autonomous supply chains are an emerging topic that has gained attention in industry and academia as a means of increasing their monitoring and robustness. While many theoretical frameworks exist, there is only sparse work to facilitate generalisable technical implementation. We address this gap by investigating multi-agent system approaches for implementing autonomous supply chains, presenting an autonomous economic agent-based technical framework. We illustrate this framework with a prototype, studied in a perishable food supply chain scenario, and discuss possible extensions.

> Critical nodes in networks are extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks to trigger negative cascading events such as the spread of misinformation and diseases. Therefore, effective moderation of critical nodes is very vital for mitigating the potential damages caused by such malicious diffusions. The current moderation methods are computationally expensive. Furthermore, they disregard the fundamental metric of information centrality, which measures the dissemination power of nodes.   We investigate the problem of removing $k$ edges from a network to minimize the information centrality of a target node $\lea$ while preserving the network's connectivity. We prove that this problem is computationally challenging: it is NP-complete and its objective function is not supermodular. However, we propose three approximation greedy algorithms using novel techniques such as random walk-based Schur complement approximation and fast sum estimation. One of our algorithms runs in nearly linear time in the number of edges.   To complement our theoretical analysis, we conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on synthetic and real networks with over one million nodes. Across various settings, the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

> Quantum algorithms for solving a wide range of practical problems have been proposed in the last ten years, such as data search and analysis, product recommendation, and credit scoring. The concern about privacy and other ethical issues in quantum computing naturally rises up. In this paper, we define a formal framework for detecting violations of differential privacy for quantum algorithms. A detection algorithm is developed to verify whether a (noisy) quantum algorithm is differentially private and automatically generate bugging information when the violation of differential privacy is reported. The information consists of a pair of quantum states that violate the privacy, to illustrate the cause of the violation. Our algorithm is equipped with Tensor Networks, a highly efficient data structure, and executed both on TensorFlow Quantum and TorchQuantum which are the quantum extensions of famous machine learning platforms -- TensorFlow and PyTorch, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm are confirmed by the experimental results of almost all types of quantum algorithms already implemented on realistic quantum computers, including quantum supremacy algorithms (beyond the capability of classical algorithms), quantum machine learning models, quantum approximate optimization algorithms, and variational quantum eigensolvers with up to 21 quantum bits.

> Adversarial attacks expose vulnerabilities of deep learning models by introducing minor perturbations to the input, which lead to substantial alterations in the output. Our research focuses on the impact of such adversarial attacks on sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, specifically machine translation models. We introduce algorithms that incorporate basic text perturbation heuristics and more advanced strategies, such as the gradient-based attack, which utilizes a differentiable approximation of the inherently non-differentiable translation metric. Through our investigation, we provide evidence that machine translation models display robustness displayed robustness against best performed known adversarial attacks, as the degree of perturbation in the output is directly proportional to the perturbation in the input. However, among underdogs, our attacks outperform alternatives, providing the best relative performance. Another strong candidate is an attack based on mixing of individual characters.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to bugs, just like other types of software systems. A significant uptick in using DNN, and its applications in wide-ranging areas, including safety-critical systems, warrant extensive research on software engineering tools for improving the reliability of DNN-based systems. One such tool that has gained significant attention in the recent years is DNN fault localization. This paper revisits mutation-based fault localization in the context of DNN models and proposes a novel technique, named deepmufl, applicable to a wide range of DNN models. We have implemented deepmufl and have evaluated its effectiveness using 109 bugs obtained from StackOverflow. Our results show that deepmufl detects 53/109 of the bugs by ranking the buggy layer in top-1 position, outperforming state-of-the-art static and dynamic DNN fault localization systems that are also designed to target the class of bugs supported by deepmufl. Moreover, we observed that we can halve the fault localization time for a pre-trained model using mutation selection, yet losing only 7.55% of the bugs localized in top-1 position.

> The rapid growth of interest in quantum computing has brought about the need to secure these powerful machines against a range of physical attacks. As qubit counts increase and quantum computers achieve higher levels of fidelity, their potential to execute novel algorithms and generate sensitive intellectual property becomes more promising. However, there is a significant gap in our understanding of the vulnerabilities these computers face in terms of security and privacy attacks. Among the potential threats are physical attacks, including those orchestrated by malicious insiders within data centers where the quantum computers are located, which could compromise the integrity of computations and resulting data. This paper presents an exploration of fault-injection attacks as one class of physical attacks on quantum computers. This work first introduces a classification of fault-injection attacks and strategies, including the domain of fault-injection attacks, the fault targets, and fault manifestations in quantum computers. The resulting classification highlights the potential threats that exist. By shedding light on the vulnerabilities of quantum computers to fault-injection attacks, this work contributes to the development of robust security measures for this emerging technology.

> The literature on adversarial attacks in computer vision typically focuses on pixel-level perturbations. These tend to be very difficult to interpret. Recent work that manipulates the latent representations of image generators to create "feature-level" adversarial perturbations gives us an opportunity to explore perceptible, interpretable adversarial attacks. We make three contributions. First, we observe that feature-level attacks provide useful classes of inputs for studying representations in models. Second, we show that these adversaries are uniquely versatile and highly robust. We demonstrate that they can be used to produce targeted, universal, disguised, physically-realizable, and black-box attacks at the ImageNet scale. Third, we show how these adversarial images can be used as a practical interpretability tool for identifying bugs in networks. We use these adversaries to make predictions about spurious associations between features and classes which we then test by designing "copy/paste" attacks in which one natural image is pasted into another to cause a targeted misclassification. Our results suggest that feature-level attacks are a promising approach for rigorous interpretability research. They support the design of tools to better understand what a model has learned and diagnose brittle feature associations. Code is available at https://github.com/thestephencasper/feature_level_adv

> The use of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques has shown to be beneficial for software engineering tasks, such as vulnerability detection and type inference. However, training deep NLP models requires significant computational resources. This paper explores techniques that aim at achieving the best usage of resources and available information in these models.   We propose a generic approach, EarlyBIRD, to build composite representations of code from the early layers of a pre-trained transformer model. We empirically investigate the viability of this approach on the CodeBERT model by comparing the performance of 12 strategies for creating composite representations with the standard practice of only using the last encoder layer.   Our evaluation on four datasets shows that several early layer combinations yield better performance on defect detection, and some combinations improve multi-class classification. More specifically, we obtain a +2 average improvement of detection accuracy on Devign with only 3 out of 12 layers of CodeBERT and a 3.3x speed-up of fine-tuning. These findings show that early layers can be used to obtain better results using the same resources, as well as to reduce resource usage during fine-tuning and inference.

> Many software projects implement APIs and algorithms in multiple programming languages. Maintaining such projects is tiresome, as developers have to ensure that any change (e.g., a bug fix or a new feature) is being propagated, timely and without errors, to implementations in other programming languages. In the world of ever-changing software, using rule-based translation tools (i.e., transpilers) or machine learning models for translating code from one language to another provides limited value. Translating each time the entire codebase from one language to another is not the way developers work. In this paper, we target a novel task: translating code changes from one programming language to another using large language models (LLMs). We design and implement the first LLM, dubbed Codeditor, to tackle this task. Codeditor explicitly models code changes as edit sequences and learns to correlate changes across programming languages. To evaluate Codeditor, we collect a corpus of 6,613 aligned code changes from 8 pairs of open-source software projects implementing similar functionalities in two programming languages (Java and C#). Results show that Codeditor outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin on all commonly used automatic metrics. Our work also reveals that Codeditor is complementary to the existing generation-based models, and their combination ensures even greater performance.

> We present SHIFT3D, a differentiable pipeline for generating 3D shapes that are structurally plausible yet challenging to 3D object detectors. In safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, discovering such novel challenging objects can offer insight into unknown vulnerabilities of 3D detectors. By representing objects with a signed distanced function (SDF), we show that gradient error signals allow us to smoothly deform the shape or pose of a 3D object in order to confuse a downstream 3D detector. Importantly, the objects generated by SHIFT3D physically differ from the baseline object yet retain a semantically recognizable shape. Our approach provides interpretable failure modes for modern 3D object detectors, and can aid in preemptive discovery of potential safety risks within 3D perception systems before these risks become critical failures.

> Face verification (FV) using deep neural network models has made tremendous progress in recent years, surpassing human accuracy and seeing deployment in various applications such as border control and smartphone unlocking. However, FV systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks, which manipulate input images to deceive these systems in ways usually unnoticeable to humans. This paper provides an in-depth study of attacks on FV systems. We introduce the DodgePersonation Attack that formulates the creation of face images that impersonate a set of given identities while avoiding being identified as any of the identities in a separate, disjoint set. A taxonomy is proposed to provide a unified view of different types of Adversarial Attacks against FV systems, including Dodging Attacks, Impersonation Attacks, and Master Face Attacks. Finally, we propose the ''One Face to Rule Them All'' Attack which implements the DodgePersonation Attack with state-of-the-art performance on a well-known scenario (Master Face Attack) and which can also be used for the new scenarios introduced in this paper. While the state-of-the-art Master Face Attack can produce a set of 9 images to cover 43.82% of the identities in their test database, with 9 images our attack can cover 57.27% to 58.5% of these identifies while giving the attacker the choice of the identity to use to create the impersonation. Moreover, the 9 generated attack images appear identical to a casual observer.

Our investigation discovered vulnerabilities in the Enhanced Wi-Fi control commands, rendering them susceptible to hijacking attacks. Notably, the study established that even readily available and cost-effective commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi routers could be leveraged as effective tools for executing such attacks. To illustrate this vulnerability, a proof-of-concept remote hijacking attack was carried out on a DJI Mini SE drone, whereby we intercepted the control commands to manipulate the drone's flight trajectory. The findings of this research emphasize the critical necessity of implementing robust security measures to safeguard unmanned aerial vehicles against potential hijacking threats. Considering that civilian drones are now used as war weapons, the study underscores the urgent need for further exploration and advancement in the domain of civilian drone security.

> Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are responsible for automating process control in many industrial systems (e.g. in manufacturing and public infrastructure), and thus it is critical to ensure that they operate correctly and safely. The majority of PLCs are programmed in languages such as Structured Text (ST). However, a lack of formal semantics makes it difficult to ascertain the correctness of their translators and compilers, which vary from vendor-to-vendor. In this work, we develop K-ST, a formal executable semantics for ST in the K framework. Defined with respect to the IEC 61131-3 standard and PLC vendor manuals, K-ST is a high-level reference semantics that can be used to evaluate the correctness and consistency of different ST implementations. We validate K-ST by executing 509 ST programs extracted from Github and comparing the results against existing commercial compilers (i.e., CODESYS, CX-Programmer, and GX Works2). We then apply K-ST to validate the implementation of the open source OpenPLC platform, comparing the executions of several test programs to uncover five bugs and nine functional defects in the compiler.

> Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). Recent success all assumes that users will not notice or disrupt the attack process despite the existence of music/noise-like sounds and spontaneous responses from voice assistants. Nonetheless, in practical user-present scenarios, user awareness may nullify existing attack attempts that launch unexpected sounds or ASR usage. In this paper, we seek to bridge the gap in existing research and extend the attack to user-present scenarios. We propose VRIFLE, an inaudible adversarial perturbation (IAP) attack via ultrasound delivery that can manipulate ASRs as a user speaks. The inherent differences between audible sounds and ultrasounds make IAP delivery face unprecedented challenges such as distortion, noise, and instability. In this regard, we design a novel ultrasonic transformation model to enhance the crafted perturbation to be physically effective and even survive long-distance delivery. We further enable VRIFLE's robustness by adopting a series of augmentation on user and real-world variations during the generation process. In this way, VRIFLE features an effective real-time manipulation of the ASR output from different distances and under any speech of users, with an alter-and-mute strategy that suppresses the impact of user disruption. Our extensive experiments in both digital and physical worlds verify VRIFLE's effectiveness under various configurations, robustness against six kinds of defenses, and universality in a targeted manner. We also show that VRIFLE can be delivered with a portable attack device and even everyday-life loudspeakers.

> Third-party libraries (TPLs) are extensively utilized by developers to expedite the software development process and incorporate external functionalities. Nevertheless, insecure TPL reuse can lead to significant security risks. Existing methods are employed to determine the presence of TPL code in the target binary. Existing methods, which involve extracting strings or conducting function matching, are employed to determine the presence of TPL code in the target binary. However, these methods often yield unsatisfactory results due to the recurrence of strings and the presence of numerous similar non-homologous functions. Additionally, they struggle to identify specific pieces of reused code in the target binary, complicating the detection of complex reuse relationships and impeding downstream tasks. In this paper, we observe that TPL reuse typically involves not just isolated functions but also areas encompassing several adjacent functions on the Function Call Graph (FCG). We introduce LibAM, a novel Area Matching framework that connects isolated functions into function areas on FCG and detects TPLs by comparing the similarity of these function areas. Furthermore, LibAM is the first approach capable of detecting the exact reuse areas on FCG and offering substantial benefits for downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LibAM outperforms all existing TPL detection methods and provides interpretable evidence for TPL detection results by identifying exact reuse areas. We also evaluate LibAM's accuracy on large-scale, real-world binaries in IoT firmware and generate a list of potential vulnerabilities for these devices. Last but not least, by analyzing the detection results of IoT firmware, we make several interesting findings, such as different target binaries always tend to reuse the same code area of TPL.

> Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to reduce manual debugging efforts for developers and improve software reliability. While conventional search-based techniques typically rely on heuristic rules or a redundancy assumption to mine fix patterns, recent years have witnessed the surge of deep learning (DL) based approaches to automate the program repair process in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is often limited by a fixed set of parameters to model the highly complex search space of APR. To ease such burden on the parametric models, in this work, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Patch Generation framework (RAP-Gen) by explicitly leveraging relevant fix patterns retrieved from a codebase of previous bug-fix pairs. Specifically, we build a hybrid patch retriever to account for both lexical and semantic matching based on the raw source code in a language-agnostic manner, which does not rely on any code-specific features. In addition, we adapt a code-aware language model CodeT5 as our foundation model to facilitate both patch retrieval and generation tasks in a unified manner. We adopt a stage-wise approach where the patch retriever first retrieves a relevant external bug-fix pair to augment the buggy input for the CodeT5 patch generator, which synthesizes a ranked list of repair patch candidates. Notably, RAP-Gen is a generic APR framework that can flexibly integrate different patch retrievers and generators to repair various types of bugs. We thoroughly evaluate RAP-Gen on three benchmarks in two programming languages, including the TFix benchmark in JavaScript, and Code Refinement and Defects4J benchmarks in Java, where the bug localization information may or may not be provided. Experimental results show that RAP-Gen significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on all benchmarks, e.g., repairing 15 more bugs on 818 Defects4J bugs.

> To understand and improve DRAM performance, reliability, security and energy efficiency, prior works study characteristics of commodity DRAM chips. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art open source infrastructures capable of conducting such studies are obsolete, poorly supported, or difficult to use, or their inflexibility limit the types of studies they can conduct.   We propose DRAM Bender, a new FPGA-based infrastructure that enables experimental studies on state-of-the-art DRAM chips. DRAM Bender offers three key features at the same time. First, DRAM Bender enables directly interfacing with a DRAM chip through its low-level interface. This allows users to issue DRAM commands in arbitrary order and with finer-grained time intervals compared to other open source infrastructures. Second, DRAM Bender exposes easy-to-use C++ and Python programming interfaces, allowing users to quickly and easily develop different types of DRAM experiments. Third, DRAM Bender is easily extensible. The modular design of DRAM Bender allows extending it to (i) support existing and emerging DRAM interfaces, and (ii) run on new commercial or custom FPGA boards with little effort.   To demonstrate that DRAM Bender is a versatile infrastructure, we conduct three case studies, two of which lead to new observations about the DRAM RowHammer vulnerability. In particular, we show that data patterns supported by DRAM Bender uncovers a larger set of bit-flips on a victim row compared to the data patterns commonly used by prior work. We demonstrate the extensibility of DRAM Bender by implementing it on five different FPGAs with DDR4 and DDR3 support. DRAM Bender is freely and openly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/DRAM-Bender.

> Despite recent success, state-of-the-art learning-based models remain highly vulnerable to input changes such as adversarial examples. In order to obtain certifiable robustness against such perturbations, recent work considers Lipschitz-based regularizers or constraints while at the same time increasing prediction margin. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of significantly decreased accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Calibrated Lipschitz-Margin Loss (CLL) that addresses this issue and improves certified robustness by tackling two problems: Firstly, commonly used margin losses do not adjust the penalties to the shrinking output distribution; caused by minimizing the Lipschitz constant $K$. Secondly, and most importantly, we observe that minimization of $K$ can lead to overly smooth decision functions. This limits the model's complexity and thus reduces accuracy. Our CLL addresses these issues by explicitly calibrating the loss w.r.t. margin and Lipschitz constant, thereby establishing full control over slack and improving robustness certificates even with larger Lipschitz constants. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, our models consistently outperform losses that leave the constant unattended. On CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, CLL improves upon state-of-the-art deterministic $L_2$ robust accuracies. In contrast to current trends, we unlock potential of much smaller models without $K=1$ constraints.

However, no data exists on who is most vulnerable to SMiShing. Prior work in phishing (its e-mail cousin) indicates that this is likely to vary by demographic and contextual factors. In our study, we collect this data from N=1007 U.S. adult mobile phone users. Younger people and college students emerge in this sample as the most vulnerable. Participants struggled to correctly identify legitimate messages and were easily misled when they knew they had an account with the faked message entity. Counterintuitively, participants with higher levels of security training and awareness were less correct in rating possible SMiSH. We recommend next steps for researchers, regulators and telecom providers.

> In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has gained relevance in training collaborative models without sharing sensitive data. Since its birth, Centralized FL (CFL) has been the most common approach in the literature, where a central entity creates a global model. However, a centralized approach leads to increased latency due to bottlenecks, heightened vulnerability to system failures, and trustworthiness concerns affecting the entity responsible for the global model creation. Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) emerged to address these concerns by promoting decentralized model aggregation and minimizing reliance on centralized architectures. However, despite the work done in DFL, the literature has not (i) studied the main aspects differentiating DFL and CFL; (ii) analyzed DFL frameworks to create and evaluate new solutions; and (iii) reviewed application scenarios using DFL. Thus, this article identifies and analyzes the main fundamentals of DFL in terms of federation architectures, topologies, communication mechanisms, security approaches, and key performance indicators. Additionally, the paper at hand explores existing mechanisms to optimize critical DFL fundamentals. Then, the most relevant features of the current DFL frameworks are reviewed and compared. After that, it analyzes the most used DFL application scenarios, identifying solutions based on the fundamentals and frameworks previously defined. Finally, the evolution of existing DFL solutions is studied to provide a list of trends, lessons learned, and open challenges.

> Reinforcement learning (RL) agents are vulnerable to adversarial disturbances, which can deteriorate task performance or compromise safety specifications. Existing methods either address safety requirements under the assumption of no adversary (e.g., safe RL) or only focus on robustness against performance adversaries (e.g., robust RL). Learning one policy that is both safe and robust remains a challenging open problem. The difficulty is how to tackle two intertwined aspects in the worst cases: feasibility and optimality. Optimality is only valid inside a feasible region, while identification of maximal feasible region must rely on learning the optimal policy. To address this issue, we propose a systematic framework to unify safe RL and robust RL, including problem formulation, iteration scheme, convergence analysis and practical algorithm design. This unification is built upon constrained two-player zero-sum Markov games. A dual policy iteration scheme is proposed, which simultaneously optimizes a task policy and a safety policy. The convergence of this iteration scheme is proved. Furthermore, we design a deep RL algorithm for practical implementation, called dually robust actor-critic (DRAC). The evaluations with safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that DRAC achieves high performance and persistent safety under all scenarios (no adversary, safety adversary, performance adversary), outperforming all baselines significantly.

> RGB-D object recognition systems improve their predictive performances by fusing color and depth information, outperforming neural network architectures that rely solely on colors. While RGB-D systems are expected to be more robust to adversarial examples than RGB-only systems, they have also been proven to be highly vulnerable. Their robustness is similar even when the adversarial examples are generated by altering only the original images' colors. Different works highlighted the vulnerability of RGB-D systems; however, there is a lacking of technical explanations for this weakness. Hence, in our work, we bridge this gap by investigating the learned deep representation of RGB-D systems, discovering that color features make the function learned by the network more complex and, thus, more sensitive to small perturbations. To mitigate this problem, we propose a defense based on a detection mechanism that makes RGB-D systems more robust against adversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense improves the performances of RGB-D systems against adversarial examples even when they are computed ad-hoc to circumvent this detection mechanism, and that is also more effective than adversarial training.

> Prompt-based learning has been proved to be an effective way in pre-trained language models (PLMs), especially in low-resource scenarios like few-shot settings. However, the trustworthiness of PLMs is of paramount significance and potential vulnerabilities have been shown in prompt-based templates that could mislead the predictions of language models, causing serious security concerns. In this paper, we will shed light on some vulnerabilities of PLMs, by proposing a prompt-based adversarial attack on manual templates in black box scenarios. First of all, we design character-level and word-level heuristic approaches to break manual templates separately. Then we present a greedy algorithm for the attack based on the above heuristic destructive approaches. Finally, we evaluate our approach with the classification tasks on three variants of BERT series models and eight datasets. And comprehensive experimental results justify the effectiveness of our approach in terms of attack success rate and attack speed.

> Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed participants (e.g., mobile devices) to train a global model without sharing data directly to a central server. Recent studies have revealed that FL is vulnerable to gradient inversion attack (GIA), which aims to reconstruct the original training samples and poses high risk against the privacy of clients in FL. However, most existing GIAs necessitate control over the server and rely on strong prior knowledge including batch normalization and data distribution information. In this work, we propose Client-side poisoning Gradient Inversion (CGI), which is a novel attack method that can be launched from clients. For the first time, we show the feasibility of a client-side adversary with limited knowledge being able to recover the training samples from the aggregated global model. We take a distinct approach in which the adversary utilizes a malicious model that amplifies the loss of a specific targeted class of interest. When honest clients employ the poisoned global model, the gradients of samples belonging to the targeted class are magnified, making them the dominant factor in the aggregated update. This enables the adversary to effectively reconstruct the private input belonging to other clients using the aggregated update. In addition, our CGI also features its ability to remain stealthy against Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs). By optimizing malicious updates and blending benign updates with a malicious replacement vector, our method remains undetected by these defense mechanisms. To evaluate the performance of CGI, we conduct experiments on various benchmark datasets, considering representative Byzantine-robust AGRs, and exploring diverse FL settings with different levels of adversary knowledge about the data. Our results demonstrate that CGI consistently and successfully extracts training input in all tested scenarios.

> Federated Contrastive Learning (FCL) is an emerging privacy-preserving paradigm in distributed learning for unlabeled data. In FCL, distributed parties collaboratively learn a global encoder with unlabeled data, and the global encoder could be widely used as a feature extractor to build models for many downstream tasks. However, FCL is also vulnerable to many security threats (e.g., backdoor attacks) due to its distributed nature, which are seldom investigated in existing solutions. In this paper, we study the backdoor attack against FCL as a pioneer research, to illustrate how backdoor attacks on distributed local clients act on downstream tasks. Specifically, in our system, malicious clients can successfully inject a backdoor into the global encoder by uploading poisoned local updates, thus downstream models built with this global encoder will also inherit the backdoor. We also investigate how to inject backdoors into multiple downstream models, in terms of two different backdoor attacks, namely the \textit{centralized attack} and the \textit{decentralized attack}. Experiment results show that both the centralized and the decentralized attacks can inject backdoors into downstream models effectively with high attack success rates. Finally, we evaluate two defense methods against our proposed backdoor attacks in FCL, which indicates that the decentralized backdoor attack is more stealthy and harder to defend.

> Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASNs) are predominantly used for underwater environments and find applications in many areas. However, a lack of security considerations, the unstable and challenging nature of the underwater environment, and the resource-constrained nature of the sensor nodes used for UW-ASNs (which makes them incapable of adopting security primitives) make the UW-ASN prone to vulnerabilities. This paper proposes an Adaptive decentralised Intrusion Detection and Prevention System called AIDPS for UW-ASNs. The proposed AIDPS can improve the security of the UW-ASNs so that they can efficiently detect underwater-related attacks (e.g., blackhole, grayhole and flooding attacks). To determine the most effective configuration of the proposed construction, we conduct a number of experiments using several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (e.g., Adaptive Random Forest (ARF), light gradient-boosting machine, and K-nearest neighbours) and concept drift detection algorithms (e.g., ADWIN, kdqTree, and Page-Hinkley). Our experimental results show that incremental ARF using ADWIN provides optimal performance when implemented with One-class support vector machine (SVM) anomaly-based detectors. Furthermore, our extensive evaluation results also show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art bench-marking methods while providing a wider range of desirable features such as scalability and complexity.

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance in various vision-related tasks. The success of ViTs motivates adversaries to perform backdoor attacks on ViTs. Although the vulnerability of traditional CNNs to backdoor attacks is well-known, backdoor attacks on ViTs are seldom-studied. Compared to CNNs capturing pixel-wise local features by convolutions, ViTs extract global context information through patches and attentions. Na\"ively transplanting CNN-specific backdoor attacks to ViTs yields only a low clean data accuracy and a low attack success rate. In this paper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack $TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor attacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan composed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM memory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT further uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the Trojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the vulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with benign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT model is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show that flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model using the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one. We perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models. TrojViT can classify $99.64\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping $345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.Our codes are available at https://github.com/mxzheng/TrojViT

> Content Security Policy (CSP) is an effective security mechanism that prevents the exploitation of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities on websites by specifying the sources from which their web pages can load resources, such as scripts and styles. CSP nonces enable websites to allow the execution of specific inline scripts and styles without relying on a whitelist. In this study, we measure and analyze the use of CSP nonces in the wild, specifically looking for nonce reuse, short nonces, and invalid nonces. We find that, of the 2271 sites that deploy a nonce-based policy, 598 of them reuse the same nonce value in more than one response, potentially enabling attackers to bypass protection offered by the CSP against XSS attacks. We analyze the causes of the nonce reuses to identify whether they are introduced by the server-side code or if the nonces are being cached by web caches. Moreover, we investigate whether nonces are only reused within the same session or for different sessions, as this impacts the effectiveness of CSP in preventing XSS attacks. Finally, we discuss the possibilities for attackers to bypass the CSP and achieve XSS in different nonce reuse scenarios.

> Due to the modern relevance of blockchain technology, smart contracts present both substantial risks and benefits. Vulnerabilities within them can trigger a cascade of consequences, resulting in significant losses. Many current papers primarily focus on classifying smart contracts for malicious intent, often relying on limited contract characteristics, such as bytecode or opcode. This paper proposes a novel, two-layered framework: 1) classifying and 2) directly repairing malicious contracts. Slither's vulnerability report is combined with source code and passed through a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier (RFC) and Large Language Models (LLMs), classifying and repairing each suggested vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuned and prompt-engineered LLMs. The smart contract repair models, built from pre-trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and fine-tuned Llama-2-7B models, reduced the overall vulnerability count by 97.5% and 96.7% respectively. A manual inspection of repaired contracts shows that all retain functionality, indicating that the proposed method is appropriate for automatic batch classification and repair of vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

> Software plays a crucial role in our daily lives, and therefore the quality and security of software systems have become increasingly important. However, vulnerabilities in software still pose a significant threat, as they can have serious consequences. Recent advances in automated program repair have sought to automatically detect and fix bugs using data-driven techniques. Sophisticated deep learning methods have been applied to this area and have achieved promising results. However, existing benchmarks for training and evaluating these techniques remain limited, as they tend to focus on a single programming language and have relatively small datasets. Moreover, many benchmarks tend to be outdated and lack diversity, focusing on a specific codebase. Worse still, the quality of bug explanations in existing datasets is low, as they typically use imprecise and uninformative commit messages as explanations.   To address these issues, we propose an automated collecting framework REEF to collect REal-world vulnErabilities and Fixes from open-source repositories. We develop a multi-language crawler to collect vulnerabilities and their fixes, and design metrics to filter for high-quality vulnerability-fix pairs. Furthermore, we propose a neural language model-based approach to generate high-quality vulnerability explanations, which is key to producing informative fix messages. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach can collect high-quality vulnerability-fix pairs and generate strong explanations. The dataset we collect contains 4,466 CVEs with 30,987 patches (including 236 CWE) across 7 programming languages with detailed related information, which is superior to existing benchmarks in scale, coverage, and quality. Evaluations by human experts further confirm that our framework produces high-quality vulnerability explanations.

> To date, over 40 Automated Program Repair (APR) tools have been designed with varying bug-fixing strategies, which have been demonstrated to have complementary performance in terms of being effective for different bug classes. Intuitively, it should be feasible to improve the overall bug-fixing performance of APR via assembling existing tools. Unfortunately, simply invoking all available APR tools for a given bug can result in unacceptable costs on APR execution as well as on patch validation (via expensive testing). Therefore, while assembling existing tools is appealing, it requires an efficient strategy to reconcile the need to fix more bugs and the requirements for practicality. In light of this problem, we propose a Preference-based Ensemble Program Repair framework (P-EPR), which seeks to effectively rank APR tools for repairing different bugs. P-EPR is the first non-learning-based APR ensemble method that is novel in its exploitation of repair patterns as a major source of knowledge for ranking APR tools and its reliance on a dynamic update strategy that enables it to immediately exploit and benefit from newly derived repair results. Experimental results show that P-EPR outperforms existing strategies significantly both in flexibility and effectiveness.

> The growing dependence of software projects on external libraries has generated apprehensions regarding the security of these libraries because of concealed vulnerabilities. Handling these vulnerabilities presents difficulties due to the temporal delay between remediation and public exposure. Furthermore, a substantial fraction of open-source projects covertly address vulnerabilities without any formal notification, influencing vulnerability management. Established solutions like OWASP predominantly hinge on public announcements, limiting their efficacy in uncovering undisclosed vulnerabilities. To address this challenge, the automated identification of vulnerability-fixing commits has come to the forefront. In this paper, we present VFFINDER, a novel graph-based approach for automated silent vulnerability fix identification. VFFINDER captures structural changes using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and represents them in annotated ASTs. To precisely capture the meaning of code changes, the changed code is represented in connection with the related unchanged code. In VFFINDER, the structure of the changed code and related unchanged code are captured and the structural changes are represented in annotated Abstract Syntax Trees (aAST). VFFINDER distinguishes vulnerability-fixing commits from non-fixing ones using attention-based graph neural network models to extract structural features expressed in aASTs. We conducted experiments to evaluate VFFINDER on a dataset of 11K+ vulnerability fixing commits in 507 real-world C/C++ projects. Our results show that VFFINDER significantly improves the state-of-the-art methods by 272-420% in Precision, 22-70% in Recall, and 3.2X-8.2X in F1. Especially, VFFINDER speeds up the silent fix identification process by up to 121% with the same effort reviewing 50K LOC compared to the existing approaches.

> People use web search engines to find information before forming opinions, which can lead to practical decisions with different levels of impact. The cognitive effort of search can leave opinionated users vulnerable to cognitive biases, e.g., the confirmation bias. In this paper, we investigate whether stance labels and their explanations can help users consume more diverse search results. We automatically classify and label search results on three topics (i.e., intellectual property rights, school uniforms, and atheism) as against, neutral, and in favor, and generate explanations for these labels. In a user study (N =203), we then investigate whether search result stance bias (balanced vs biased) and the level of explanation (plain text, label only, label and explanation) influence the diversity of search results clicked. We find that stance labels and explanations lead to a more diverse search result consumption. However, we do not find evidence for systematic opinion change among users in this context. We believe these results can help designers of search engines to make more informed design decisions.

> This paper presents VulnSense framework, a comprehensive approach to efficiently detect vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts using a multimodal learning approach on graph-based and natural language processing (NLP) models. Our proposed framework combines three types of features from smart contracts comprising source code, opcode sequences, and control flow graph (CFG) extracted from bytecode. We employ Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to extract and analyze these features. The final layer of our multimodal approach consists of a fully connected layer used to predict vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. Addressing limitations of existing vulnerability detection methods relying on single-feature or single-model deep learning techniques, our method surpasses accuracy and effectiveness constraints. We assess VulnSense using a collection of 1.769 smart contracts derived from the combination of three datasets: Curated, SolidiFI-Benchmark, and Smartbugs Wild. We then make a comparison with various unimodal and multimodal learning techniques contributed by GNN, BiLSTM and BERT architectures. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, achieving an average accuracy of 77.96\% across all three categories of vulnerable smart contracts.

In this work, we introduce a modified trimmed-inner-product algorithm to robustly estimate the covariance in an online scenario even in the presence of arbitrary and adversarial data attacks. At each time step, data points, drawn nominally independently and identically from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, arrive. However, a certain fraction of these points may have been arbitrarily corrupted. We propose an online algorithm to estimate the sparse inverse covariance (i.e., precision) matrix despite this corruption. We provide the error-bound and convergence properties of the estimates to the true precision matrix under our algorithms.

> 3D object detection is an essential perception task in autonomous driving to understand the environments. The Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations have significantly improved the performance of 3D detectors with camera inputs on popular benchmarks. However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the robustness of these vision-dependent BEV models, which is closely related to the safety of autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we evaluate the natural and adversarial robustness of various representative models under extensive settings, to fully understand their behaviors influenced by explicit BEV features compared with those without BEV. In addition to the classic settings, we propose a 3D consistent patch attack by applying adversarial patches in the 3D space to guarantee the spatiotemporal consistency, which is more realistic for the scenario of autonomous driving. With substantial experiments, we draw several findings: 1) BEV models tend to be more stable than previous methods under different natural conditions and common corruptions due to the expressive spatial representations; 2) BEV models are more vulnerable to adversarial noises, mainly caused by the redundant BEV features; 3) Camera-LiDAR fusion models have superior performance under different settings with multi-modal inputs, but BEV fusion model is still vulnerable to adversarial noises of both point cloud and image. These findings alert the safety issue in the applications of BEV detectors and could facilitate the development of more robust models.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown unprecedented success in object detection tasks. However, it was also discovered that DNNs are vulnerable to multiple kinds of attacks, including Backdoor Attacks. Through the attack, the attacker manages to embed a hidden backdoor into the DNN such that the model behaves normally on benign data samples, but makes attacker-specified judgments given the occurrence of a predefined trigger. Although numerous backdoor attacks have been experimented on image classification, backdoor attacks on object detection tasks have not been properly investigated and explored. As object detection has been adopted as an important module in multiple security-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose even more severe threats. Inspired by the inherent property of deep learning-based object detectors, we propose a simple yet effective backdoor attack method against object detection without modifying the ground truth annotations, specifically focusing on the object disappearance attack and object generation attack. Extensive experiments and ablation studies prove the effectiveness of our attack on the benchmark object detection dataset MSCOCO2017, on which we achieve an attack success rate of more than 92% with a poison rate of only 5%.

To achieve the highest assurance evaluation level, we develop a fine-grained formal specification of the Zephyr RTOS buddy memory management, which closely follows the C code easing validation of the specification and the source code. The rely-guarantee-based compositional verification technique has been enforced over the formal model. To support formal verification of the security property, we extend our rely-guarantee framework PiCore by a compositional reasoning approach for integrity. Whilst the security verification of the design shows that it preserves the integrity property, the verification of the functional properties shows several problems. These verification issues are translated into finding three bugs in the C implementation of Zephyr, after inspecting the source code corresponding to the design lines breaking the properties.

> Operating systems provide an abstraction layer between the hardware and higher-level software. Many abstractions, such as threads, processes, containers, and virtual machines, are mechanisms to provide isolation. New application scenarios frequently introduce new isolation mechanisms. Implementing each isolation mechanism as an independent abstraction makes it difficult to reason about the state and resources shared among different tasks, leading to security vulnerabilities and performance interference. We present OSmosis, an isolation model that expresses the precise level of resource sharing, a framework in which to implement isolation mechanisms based on the model, and an implementation of the framework on seL4. The OSmosis model lets the user determine the degree of isolation guarantee that they need from the system. This determination empowers developers to make informed decisions about isolation and performance trade-offs, and the framework enables them to create mechanisms with the desired degree of isolation.

- `2309.09308v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09308v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09308v1)

> Automated program repair (APR) aims to fix software bugs without human intervention and template-based APR has been widely investigated with promising results. However, it is challenging for template-based APR to select the appropriate donor code, which is an important repair ingredient for generating candidate patches. Inappropriate donor code may cause plausible but incorrect patch generation even with correct fix patterns, limiting the repair performance.   In this paper, we aim to revisit template-based APR, and propose GAMMA, to directly leverage large pre-trained language models for donor code generation. Our main insight is that instead of retrieving donor code in the local buggy file, we can directly predict the correct code tokens based on the context code snippets and repair patterns by a cloze task. Specifically, (1) GAMMA revises a variety of fix templates from state-of-the-art template-based APR techniques (i.e., TBar) and transforms them into mask patterns. (2) GAMMA adopts a pre-trained language model to predict the correct code for masked code as a fill-in-the-blank task. The experimental results demonstrate that GAMMA correctly repairs 82 bugs on Defects4J-v1.2, which achieves 20.59\% (14 bugs) and 26.15\% (17 bugs) improvement over the previous state-of-the-art template-based approach TBar and learning-based one Recoder. Furthermore, GAMMA repairs 45 bugs and 22 bugs from the additional Defects4J-v2.0 and QuixBugs, indicating the generalizability of GAMMA in addressing the dataset overfitting issue. We also prove that adopting other pre-trained language models can provide substantial advancement, e.g., CodeBERT-based and ChatGPT-based GAMMA is able to fix 80 and 67 bugs on Defects4J-v1.2, indicating the scalability of GAMMA. Overall, our study highlights the promising future of adopting pre-trained models to generate correct patches on top of fix patterns.

> Existing research primarily focuses on backdoor attacks and defenses within the generic federated learning scenario, where all clients collaborate to train a single global model. A recent study conducted by Qin et al. (2023) marks the initial exploration of backdoor attacks within the personalized federated learning (pFL) scenario, where each client constructs a personalized model based on its local data. Notably, the study demonstrates that pFL methods with \textit{parameter decoupling} can significantly enhance robustness against backdoor attacks. However, in this paper, we whistleblow that pFL methods with parameter decoupling are still vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The resistance of pFL methods with parameter decoupling is attributed to the heterogeneous classifiers between malicious clients and benign counterparts. We analyze two direct causes of the heterogeneous classifiers: (1) data heterogeneity inherently exists among clients and (2) poisoning by malicious clients further exacerbates the data heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose a two-pronged attack method, BapFL, which comprises two simple yet effective strategies: (1) poisoning only the feature encoder while keeping the classifier fixed and (2) diversifying the classifier through noise introduction to simulate that of the benign clients. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets under varying conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of six widely used defense methods and find that BapFL still poses a significant threat even in the presence of the best defense, Multi-Krum. We hope to inspire further research on attack and defense strategies in pFL scenarios. The code is available at: https://github.com/BapFL/code.

> Directed fuzzing is a dynamic testing technique that focuses exploration on specific, pre targeted program locations. Like other types of fuzzers, directed fuzzers are most effective when maximizing testing speed and precision. To this end, recent directed fuzzers have begun leveraging path pruning: preventing the wasteful testing of program paths deemed irrelevant to reaching a desired target location. Yet, despite code pruning's substantial speedup, current approaches are imprecise failing to capture indirect control flow requiring additional dynamic analyses that diminish directed fuzzers' speeds. Thus, without code pruning that is both fast and precise, directed fuzzers' effectiveness will continue to remain limited. This paper aims to tackle the challenge of upholding both speed and precision in pruning-based directed fuzzing. We show that existing pruning approaches fail to recover common case indirect control flow; and identify opportunities to enhance them with lightweight heuristics namely, function signature matching enabling them to maximize precision without the burden of dynamic analysis. We implement our enhanced pruning as a prototype, TOPr (Target Oriented Pruning), and evaluate it against the leading pruning based and pruning agnostic directed fuzzers SieveFuzz and AFLGo. We show that TOPr's enhanced pruning outperforms these fuzzers in (1) speed (achieving 222% and 73% higher test case throughput, respectively); (2) reachability (achieving 149% and 9% more target relevant coverage, respectively); and (3) bug discovery time (triggering bugs faster 85% and 8%, respectively). Furthermore, TOPr's balance of speed and precision enables it to find 24 new bugs in 5 open source applications, with 18 confirmed by developers, 12 bugs labelled as "Priority - 1. High", and 12 bugs fixed, underscoring the effectiveness of our framework.

> Conducting safety simulations in various simulators, such as the Gazebo simulator, became a very popular means of testing vehicles against potential safety risks (i.e. crashes). However, this was not the case with security testing. Performing security testing in a simulator is very difficult because security attacks are performed on a different abstraction level. In addition, the attacks themselves are becoming more sophisticated, which directly contributes to the difficulty of executing them in a simulator. In this paper, we attempt to tackle the aforementioned gap by investigating possible attacks that can be simulated, and then performing their simulations. The presented approach shows that attacks targeting the LiDAR and GPS components of unmanned aerial vehicles can be simulated. This is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities of the ROS and MAVLink protocol and injecting malicious processes into an application. As a result, messages with arbitrary values can be spoofed to the corresponding topics, which allows attackers to update relevant parameters and cause a potential crash of a vehicle. This was tested in multiple scenarios, thereby proving that it is indeed possible to simulate certain attack types, such as spoofing and jamming.

> The identification of vulnerabilities is a continuous challenge in software projects. This is due to the evolution of methods that attackers employ as well as the constant updates to the software, which reveal additional issues. As a result, new and innovative approaches for the identification of vulnerable software are needed. In this paper, we present VULNERLIZER, which is a novel framework for cross-analysis between vulnerabilities and software libraries. It uses CVE and software library data together with clustering algorithms to generate links between vulnerabilities and libraries. In addition, the training of the model is conducted in order to reevaluate the generated associations. This is achieved by updating the assigned weights. Finally, the approach is then evaluated by making the predictions using the CVE data from the test set. The results show that the VULNERLIZER has a great potential in being able to predict future vulnerable libraries based on an initial input CVE entry or a software library. The trained model reaches a prediction accuracy of 75% or higher.

> Self-adaptive systems offer several attack surfaces due to the communication via different channels and the different sensors required to observe the environment. Often, attacks cause safety to be compromised as well, making it necessary to consider these two aspects together. Furthermore, the approaches currently used for safety and security analysis do not sufficiently take into account the intermediate steps of an adaptation. Current work in this area ignores the fact that a self-adaptive system also reveals possible vulnerabilities (even if only temporarily) during the adaptation. To address this issue, we propose a modeling approach that takes into account the different relevant aspects of a system, its adaptation process, as well as safety hazards and security attacks. We present several models that describe different aspects of a self-adaptive system and we outline our idea of how these models can then be combined into an Attack-Fault Tree. This allows modeling aspects of the system on different levels of abstraction and co-evolve the models using transformations according to the adaptation of the system. Finally, analyses can then be performed as usual on the resulting Attack-Fault Tree.

> Image steganography is the art of concealing secret information in images in a way that is imperceptible to unauthorized parties. Recent advances show that is possible to use a fixed neural network (FNN) for secret embedding and extraction. Such fixed neural network steganography (FNNS) achieves high steganographic performance without training the networks, which could be more useful in real-world applications. However, the existing FNNS schemes are vulnerable in the sense that anyone can extract the secret from the stego-image. To deal with this issue, we propose a key-based FNNS scheme to improve the security of the FNNS, where we generate key-controlled perturbations from the FNN for data embedding. As such, only the receiver who possesses the key is able to correctly extract the secret from the stego-image using the FNN. In order to improve the visual quality and undetectability of the stego-image, we further propose an adaptive perturbation optimization strategy by taking the perturbation cost into account. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme is capable of preventing unauthorized secret extraction from the stego-images. Furthermore, our scheme is able to generate stego-images with higher visual quality than the state-of-the-art FNNS scheme, especially when the FNN is a neural network for ordinary learning tasks.

> Static analysis tools have gained popularity among developers for finding potential bugs, but their widespread adoption is hindered by the accomnpanying high false alarm rates (up to 90%). To address this challenge, previous studies proposed the concept of actionable warnings, and apply machine-learning methods to distinguish actionable warnings from false alarms. Despite these efforts, our preliminary study suggests that the current methods used to collect actionable warnings are rather shaky and unreliable, resulting in a large proportion of invalid actionable warnings. In this work, we mined 68,274 reversions from Top-500 Github C repositories to create a substantia actionable warning dataset and assigned weak labels to each warning's likelihood of being a real bug. To automatically identify actionable warnings and recommend those with a high probability of being real bugs (AWHB), we propose a two-stage framework called ACWRecommender. In the first stage, our tool use a pre-trained model, i.e., UniXcoder, to identify actionable warnings from a huge number of SA tool's reported warnings. In the second stage, we rerank valid actionable warnings to the top by using weakly supervised learning. Experimental results showed that our tool outperformed several baselines for actionable warning detection (in terms of F1-score) and performed better for AWHB recommendation (in terms of nDCG and MRR). Additionaly, we also performed an in-the-wild evaluation, we manually validated 24 warnings out of 2,197 reported warnings on 10 randomly selected projects, 22 of which were confirmed by developers as real bugs, demonstrating the practical usage of our tool.

> Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs), which organize visual-text factual knowledge, have recently been successfully applied to tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, and recommendation system. Since most MKGs are far from complete, extensive knowledge graph completion studies have been proposed focusing on the multimodal entity, relation extraction and link prediction. However, different tasks and modalities require changes to the model architecture, and not all images/objects are relevant to text input, which hinders the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid transformer with multi-level fusion to address those issues. Specifically, we leverage a hybrid transformer architecture with unified input-output for diverse multimodal knowledge graph completion tasks. Moreover, we propose multi-level fusion, which integrates visual and text representation via coarse-grained prefix-guided interaction and fine-grained correlation-aware fusion modules. We conduct extensive experiments to validate that our MKGformer can obtain SOTA performance on four datasets of multimodal link prediction, multimodal RE, and multimodal NER.

> Joint safety and security analysis of cyber-physical systems is a necessary step to correctly capture inter-dependencies between these properties. Attack-Fault Trees represent a combination of dynamic Fault Trees and Attack Trees and can be used to model and model-check a holistic view on both safety and security. Manually creating a complete AFT for the whole system is, however, a daunting task. It needs to span multiple abstraction layers, e.g., abstract application architecture and data flow as well as system and library dependencies that are affected by various vulnerabilities. We present an AFT generation tool-chain that facilitates this task using partial Fault and Attack Trees that are either manually created or mined from vulnerability databases. We semi-automatically create two system models that provide the necessary information to automatically combine these partial Fault and Attack Trees into complete AFTs using graph transformation rules.

> Along with the development of large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, many existing approaches and tools for software security are changing. It is, therefore, essential to understand how security-aware these models are and how these models impact software security practices and education. In exercises of a software security course at our university, we ask students to identify and fix vulnerabilities we insert in a web application using state-of-the-art tools. After ChatGPT, especially the GPT-4 version of the model, we want to know how the students can possibly use ChatGPT to complete the exercise tasks. We input the vulnerable code to ChatGPT and measure its accuracy in vulnerability identification and fixing. In addition, we investigated whether ChatGPT can provide a proper source of information to support its outputs. Results show that ChatGPT can identify 20 of the 28 vulnerabilities we inserted in the web application in a white-box setting, reported three false positives, and found four extra vulnerabilities beyond the ones we inserted. ChatGPT makes nine satisfactory penetration testing and fixing recommendations for the ten vulnerabilities we want students to fix and can often point to related sources of information.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to possess strong representation abilities over graph data. However, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and even minor perturbations to the graph structure can significantly degrade their performance. Existing methods either are ineffective against sophisticated attacks or require the optimization of dense adjacency matrices, which is time-consuming and prone to local minima. To remedy this problem, we propose an Efficient Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN) defense method, which aims to learn low-rank and sparse graph structures for defending against adversarial attacks, ensuring effective defense with greater efficiency. Specifically, ELR-GNN consists of two modules: a Coarse Low-Rank Estimation Module and a Fine-Grained Estimation Module. The first module adopts the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to initialize the low-rank adjacency matrix estimation, which serves as a starting point for optimizing the low-rank matrix. In the second module, the initial estimate is refined by jointly learning a low-rank sparse graph structure with the GNN model. Sparsity is incorporated into the learned low-rank adjacency matrix by pruning weak connections, which can reduce redundant data while maintaining valuable information. As a result, instead of using the dense adjacency matrix directly, ELR-GNN can learn a low-rank and sparse estimate of it in a simple, efficient and easy to optimize manner. The experimental results demonstrate that ELR-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN defense methods in the literature, in addition to being very efficient and easy to train.

> Joint source and channel coding (JSCC) has attracted increasing attention due to its robustness and high efficiency. However, JSCC is vulnerable to privacy leakage due to the high relevance between the source image and channel input. In this paper, we propose a disentangled information bottleneck guided privacy-protective JSCC (DIB-PPJSCC) for image transmission, which aims at protecting private information as well as achieving superior communication performance at the legitimate receiver. In particular, we propose a DIB objective to disentangle private and public information. The goal is to compress the private information in the public subcodewords, preserve the private information in the private subcodewords and improve the reconstruction quality simultaneously. In order to optimize JSCC neural networks using the DIB objective, we derive a differentiable estimation of the DIB objective based on the variational approximation and the density-ratio trick. Additionally, we design a password-based privacy-protective (PP) algorithm which can be jointly optimized with JSCC neural networks to encrypt the private subcodewords. Specifically, we employ a private information encryptor to encrypt the private subcodewords before transmission, and a corresponding decryptor to recover the private information at the legitimate receiver. A loss function for jointly training the encryptor, decryptor and JSCC decoder is derived based on the maximum entropy principle, which aims at maximizing the eavesdropping uncertainty as well as improving the reconstruction quality. Experimental results show that DIB-PPJSCC can reduce the eavesdropping accuracy on private information up to $15\%$ and reduce $10\%$ inference time compared to existing privacy-protective JSCC and traditional separate methods.

> On open source software (OSS) platforms such as GitHub, forking and accepting pull-requests is an important approach for OSS projects to receive contributions, especially from external contributors who cannot directly commit into the source repositories. Having a large number of forks is often considered as an indicator of a project being popular. While extensive studies have been conducted to understand the reasons of forking, communications between forks, features and impacts of forks, there are few quantitative measures that can provide a simple yet informative way to gain insights about an OSS project's forks besides their count. Inspired by studies on biodiversity and OSS team diversity, in this paper, we propose an approach to measure the diversity of an OSS project's forks (i.e., its fork population). We devise a novel fork entropy metric based on Rao's quadratic entropy to measure such diversity according to the forks' modifications to project files. With properties including symmetry, continuity, and monotonicity, the proposed fork entropy metric is effective in quantifying the diversity of a project's fork population. To further examine the usefulness of the proposed metric, we conduct empirical studies with data retrieved from fifty projects on GitHub. We observe significant correlations between a project's fork entropy and different outcome variables including the project's external productivity measured by the number of external contributors' commits, acceptance rate of external contributors' pull-requests, and the number of reported bugs. We also observe significant interactions between fork entropy and other factors such as the number of forks. The results suggest that fork entropy effectively enriches our understanding of OSS projects' forks beyond the simple number of forks, and can potentially support further research and applications.

> Deep learning has been widely used in source code classification tasks, such as code classification according to their functionalities, code authorship attribution, and vulnerability detection. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of deep learning makes it hard to interpret and understand why a classifier (i.e., classification model) makes a particular prediction on a given example. This lack of interpretability (or explainability) might have hindered their adoption by practitioners because it is not clear when they should or should not trust a classifier's prediction. The lack of interpretability has motivated a number of studies in recent years. However, existing methods are neither robust nor able to cope with out-of-distribution examples. In this paper, we propose a novel method to produce \underline{Rob}ust \underline{in}terpreters for a given deep learning-based code classifier; the method is dubbed Robin. The key idea behind Robin is a novel hybrid structure combining an interpreter and two approximators, while leveraging the ideas of adversarial training and data augmentation. Experimental results show that on average the interpreter produced by Robin achieves a 6.11\% higher fidelity (evaluated on the classifier), 67.22\% higher fidelity (evaluated on the approximator), and 15.87x higher robustness than that of the three existing interpreters we evaluated. Moreover, the interpreter is 47.31\% less affected by out-of-distribution examples than that of LEMNA.

> With a rise in false, inaccurate, and misleading information in propaganda, news, and social media, real-world Question Answering (QA) systems face the challenges of synthesizing and reasoning over misinformation-polluted contexts to derive correct answers. This urgency gives rise to the need to make QA systems robust to misinformation, a topic previously unexplored. We study the risk of misinformation to QA models by investigating the sensitivity of open-domain QA models to corpus pollution with misinformation documents. We curate both human-written and model-generated false documents that we inject into the evidence corpus of QA models and assess the impact on the performance of these systems. Experiments show that QA models are vulnerable to even small amounts of evidence contamination brought by misinformation, with large absolute performance drops on all models. Misinformation attack brings more threat when fake documents are produced at scale by neural models or the attacker targets hacking specific questions of interest. To defend against such a threat, we discuss the necessity of building a misinformation-aware QA system that integrates question-answering and misinformation detection in a joint fashion.

Adversarial motivations behind quantum Trojans are analyzed. By consolidating diverse threats into a unified perspective, this quantum Trojan taxonomy provides insights guiding threat modeling, risk analysis, detection mechanisms, and security best practices customized for this novel computing paradigm.

> Software often fails in the field, however reproducing and debugging field failures is very challenging: the failure-inducing input may be missing, and the program setup can be complicated and hard to reproduce by the developers. In this paper, we propose to generate fault signatures from the failure locations and the original source code to reproduce the faults in small executable programs. We say that a fault signature reproduces the fault in the original program if the two failed in the same location, triggered the same error conditions after executing the same selective sequences of failure-inducing statements. A fault signature aims to contain only sufficient statements that can reproduce the faults. That way, it provides some context to inform how a fault is developed and also avoids unnecessary complexity and setups that may block fault diagnosis. To compute fault signatures from the failures, we applied a path-sensitive static analysis tool to generate a path that leads to the fault, and then applied an existing syntactic patching tool to convert the path into an executable program. Our evaluation on real-world bugs from Corebench, BugBench, and Manybugs shows that fault signatures can reproduce the fault for the original programs. Because fault signatures are less complex, automatic test input generation tools generated failure-inducing inputs that could not be generated by using the entire programs. Some failure-inducing inputs can be directly transferred to the original programs. Our experimental data are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5430155.

> In this paper we consider the setting where machine learning models are retrained on updated datasets in order to incorporate the most up-to-date information or reflect distribution shifts. We investigate whether one can infer information about these updates in the training data (e.g., changes to attribute values of records). Here, the adversary has access to snapshots of the machine learning model before and after the change in the dataset occurs. Contrary to the existing literature, we assume that an attribute of a single or multiple training data points are changed rather than entire data records are removed or added. We propose attacks based on the difference in the prediction confidence of the original model and the updated model. We evaluate our attack methods on two public datasets along with multi-layer perceptron and logistic regression models. We validate that two snapshots of the model can result in higher information leakage in comparison to having access to only the updated model. Moreover, we observe that data records with rare values are more vulnerable to attacks, which points to the disparate vulnerability of privacy attacks in the update setting. When multiple records with the same original attribute value are updated to the same new value (i.e., repeated changes), the attacker is more likely to correctly guess the updated values since repeated changes leave a larger footprint on the trained model. These observations point to vulnerability of machine learning models to attribute inference attacks in the update setting.

> As video games evolve into expansive, detailed worlds, visual quality becomes essential, yet increasingly challenging. Traditional testing methods, limited by resources, face difficulties in addressing the plethora of potential bugs. Machine learning offers scalable solutions; however, heavy reliance on large labeled datasets remains a constraint. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel method, utilizing unlabeled gameplay and domain-specific augmentations to generate datasets & self-supervised objectives used during pre-training or multi-task settings for downstream visual bug detection. Our methodology uses weak-supervision to scale datasets for the crafted objectives and facilitates both autonomous and interactive weak-supervision, incorporating unsupervised clustering and/or an interactive approach based on text and geometric prompts. We demonstrate on first-person player clipping/collision bugs (FPPC) within the expansive Giantmap game world, that our approach is very effective, improving over a strong supervised baseline in a practical, very low-prevalence, low data regime (0.336 $\rightarrow$ 0.550 F1 score). With just 5 labeled "good" exemplars (i.e., 0 bugs), our self-supervised objective alone captures enough signal to outperform the low-labeled supervised settings. Building on large-pretrained vision models, our approach is adaptable across various visual bugs. Our results suggest applicability in curating datasets for broader image and video tasks within video games beyond visual bugs.

> Creating resilient machine learning (ML) systems has become necessary to ensure production-ready ML systems that acquire user confidence seamlessly. The quality of the input data and the model highly influence the successful end-to-end testing in data-sensitive systems. However, the testing approaches of input data are not as systematic and are few compared to model testing. To address this gap, this paper presents the Fault Injection for Undesirable Learning in input Data (FIUL-Data) testing framework that tests the resilience of ML models to multiple intentionally-triggered data faults. Data mutators explore vulnerabilities of ML systems against the effects of different fault injections. The proposed framework is designed based on three main ideas: The mutators are not random; one data mutator is applied at an instance of time, and the selected ML models are optimized beforehand. This paper evaluates the FIUL-Data framework using data from analytical chemistry, comprising retention time measurements of anti-sense oligonucleotide. Empirical evaluation is carried out in a two-step process in which the responses of selected ML models to data mutation are analyzed individually and then compared with each other. The results show that the FIUL-Data framework allows the evaluation of the resilience of ML models. In most experiments cases, ML models show higher resilience at larger training datasets, where gradient boost performed better than support vector regression in smaller training sets. Overall, the mean squared error metric is useful in evaluating the resilience of models due to its higher sensitivity to data mutation.

> Automatic Speech Recognition systems have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate the command executed on the device. Recent research has focused on exploring methods to create such attacks, however, some issues relating to Over-The-Air (OTA) attacks have not been properly addressed. In our work, we examine the needed properties of robust attacks compatible with the OTA model, and we design a method of generating attacks with arbitrary such desired properties, namely the invariance to synchronization, and the robustness to filtering: this allows a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack against ASR systems. We achieve these characteristics by constructing attacks in a modified frequency domain through an inverse Fourier transform. We evaluate our method on standard keyword classification tasks and analyze it in OTA, and we analyze the properties of the cross-domain attacks to explain the efficiency of the approach.

> To mitigate climate change, the share of renewable energies in power production needs to be increased. Renewables introduce new challenges to power grids regarding the dynamic stability due to decentralization, reduced inertia, and volatility in production. Since dynamic stability simulations are intractable and exceedingly expensive for large grids, graph neural networks (GNNs) are a promising method to reduce the computational effort of analyzing the dynamic stability of power grids. As a testbed for GNN models, we generate new, large datasets of dynamic stability of synthetic power grids, and provide them as an open-source resource to the research community. We find that GNNs are surprisingly effective at predicting the highly non-linear targets from topological information only. For the first time, performance that is suitable for practical use cases is achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of these models to accurately identify particular vulnerable nodes in power grids, so-called troublemakers. Last, we find that GNNs trained on small grids generate accurate predictions on a large synthetic model of the Texan power grid, which illustrates the potential for real-world applications.

> Developers expend a significant amount of time in editing code for a variety of reasons such as bug fixing or adding new features. Designing effective methods to predict code edits has been an active yet challenging area of research due to the diversity of code edits and the difficulty of capturing the developer intent. In this work, we address these challenges by endowing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) of code with the knowledge of prior, relevant edits. The generative capability of the LLMs helps address the diversity in code changes and conditioning code generation on prior edits helps capture the latent developer intent. We evaluate two well-known LLMs, Codex and CodeT5, in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings respectively. In our experiments with two datasets, the knowledge of prior edits boosts the performance of the LLMs significantly and enables them to generate 29% and 54% more correctly edited code in top-1 suggestions relative to the current state-of-the-art symbolic and neural approaches, respectively.

> Many researchers studying online communities seek to make them better. However, beyond a small set of widely-held values, such as combating misinformation and abuse, determining what 'better' means can be challenging, as community members may disagree, values may be in conflict, and different communities may have differing preferences as a whole. In this work, we present the first study that elicits values directly from members across a diverse set of communities. We survey 212 members of 627 unique subreddits and ask them to describe their values for their communities in their own words. Through iterative categorization of 1,481 responses, we develop and validate a comprehensive taxonomy of community values, consisting of 29 subcategories within nine top-level categories, enabling principled, quantitative study of community values by researchers. Using our taxonomy, we reframe existing research problems, such as managing influxes of new members, as tensions between different values, and we identify understudied values, such as those regarding content quality and community size. We call for greater attention to vulnerable community members' values, and we make our codebook public for use in future research.

> Synthetic data is seen as the most promising solution to share individual-level data while preserving privacy. Shadow modeling-based Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have become the standard approach to evaluate the privacy risk of synthetic data. While very effective, they require a large number of datasets to be created and models trained to evaluate the risk posed by a single record. The privacy risk of a dataset is thus currently evaluated by running MIAs on a handful of records selected using ad-hoc methods. We here propose what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first principled vulnerable record identification technique for synthetic data publishing, leveraging the distance to a record's closest neighbors. We show our method to strongly outperform previous ad-hoc methods across datasets and generators. We also show evidence of our method to be robust to the choice of MIA and to specific choice of parameters. Finally, we show it to accurately identify vulnerable records when synthetic data generators are made differentially private. The choice of vulnerable records is as important as more accurate MIAs when evaluating the privacy of synthetic data releases, including from a legal perspective. We here propose a simple yet highly effective method to do so. We hope our method will enable practitioners to better estimate the risk posed by synthetic data publishing and researchers to fairly compare ever improving MIAs on synthetic data.

> Federated Learning (FL) has revolutionized how we train deep neural networks by enabling decentralized collaboration while safeguarding sensitive data and improving model performance. However, FL faces two crucial challenges: the diverse nature of data held by individual clients and the vulnerability of the FL system to security breaches. This paper introduces an innovative solution named Estimated Mean Aggregation (EMA) that not only addresses these challenges but also provides a fundamental reference point as a $\mathsf{baseline}$ for advanced aggregation techniques in FL systems. EMA's significance lies in its dual role: enhancing model security by effectively handling malicious outliers through trimmed means and uncovering data heterogeneity to ensure that trained models are adaptable across various client datasets. Through a wealth of experiments, EMA consistently demonstrates high accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) compared to alternative methods, establishing itself as a robust baseline for evaluating the effectiveness and security of FL aggregation methods. EMA's contributions thus offer a crucial step forward in advancing the efficiency, security, and versatility of decentralized deep learning in the context of FL.

> Interpretable AI tools are often motivated by the goal of understanding model behavior in out-of-distribution (OOD) contexts. Despite the attention this area of study receives, there are comparatively few cases where these tools have identified previously unknown bugs in models. We argue that this is due, in part, to a common feature of many interpretability methods: they analyze model behavior by using a particular dataset. This only allows for the study of the model in the context of features that the user can sample in advance. To address this, a growing body of research involves interpreting models using \emph{feature synthesis} methods that do not depend on a dataset.   In this paper, we benchmark the usefulness of interpretability tools on debugging tasks. Our key insight is that we can implant human-interpretable trojans into models and then evaluate these tools based on whether they can help humans discover them. This is analogous to finding OOD bugs, except the ground truth is known, allowing us to know when an interpretation is correct. We make four contributions. (1) We propose trojan discovery as an evaluation task for interpretability tools and introduce a benchmark with 12 trojans of 3 different types. (2) We demonstrate the difficulty of this benchmark with a preliminary evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art feature attribution/saliency tools. Even under ideal conditions, given direct access to data with the trojan trigger, these methods still often fail to identify bugs. (3) We evaluate 7 feature-synthesis methods on our benchmark. (4) We introduce and evaluate 2 new variants of the best-performing method from the previous evaluation.

> Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have emerged as tools to facilitate the management of software dependencies, vulnerabilities, licenses, and the supply chain. While significant effort has been devoted to increasing SBOM awareness and developing SBOM formats and tools, recent studies have shown that SBOMs are still an early technology not yet adequately adopted in practice. Expanding on previous research, this paper reports a comprehensive study that investigates the current challenges stakeholders encounter when creating and using SBOMs. The study surveyed 138 practitioners belonging to five stakeholder groups (practitioners familiar with SBOMs, members of critical open source projects, AI/ML, cyber-physical systems, and legal practitioners) using differentiated questionnaires, and interviewed 8 survey respondents to gather further insights about their experience. We identified 12 major challenges facing the creation and use of SBOMs, including those related to the SBOM content, deficiencies in SBOM tools, SBOM maintenance and verification, and domain-specific challenges. We propose and discuss 4 actionable solutions to the identified challenges and present the major avenues for future research and development.

> In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive approach to bolstering the security, reliability, and comprehensibility of OpenAirInterface5G (OAI5G), an open-source software framework for the exploration, development, and testing of 5G wireless communication systems. Firstly, we employ AFL++, a powerful fuzzing tool, to fuzzy-test OAI5G with respect to its configuration files rigorously. This extensive testing process helps identify errors, defects, and security vulnerabilities that may evade conventional testing methods. Secondly, we harness the capabilities of Large Language Models such as Google Bard to automatically decipher and document the meanings of parameters within the OAI5G codebase that are used in fuzzing. This automated parameter interpretation streamlines subsequent analyses and facilitates more informed decision-making. Together, these two techniques contribute to fortifying the OAI5G system, making it more robust, secure, and understandable for developers and analysts alike.

A number of effective attacks using neural networks have already been published, but reducing their cost in terms of the amount of computing resources and data required is an ever-present goal, which we pursue in this work. We focus on the ANSSI Side-Channel Attack Database (ASCAD), and produce a JAX-based framework for deep-learning-based SCA, with which we reproduce a selection of previous results and build upon them in an attempt to improve their performance. We also investigate the effectiveness of various Transformer-based models.

> While anonymity networks like Tor aim to protect the privacy of their users, they are vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks such as Website Fingerprinting (WF) and Flow Correlation (FC). Recent implementations of WF and FC attacks, such as Tik-Tok and DeepCoFFEA, have shown that the attacks can be effectively carried out, threatening user privacy. Consequently, there is a need for effective traffic analysis defense.   There are a variety of existing defenses, but most are either ineffective, incur high latency and bandwidth overhead, or require additional infrastructure. As a result, we aim to design a traffic analysis defense that is efficient and highly resistant to both WF and FC attacks. We propose DeTorrent, which uses competing neural networks to generate and evaluate traffic analysis defenses that insert 'dummy' traffic into real traffic flows. DeTorrent operates with moderate overhead and without delaying traffic. In a closed-world WF setting, it reduces an attacker's accuracy by 61.5%, a reduction 10.5% better than the next-best padding-only defense. Against the state-of-the-art FC attacker, DeTorrent reduces the true positive rate for a $10^{-5}$ false positive rate to about .12, which is less than half that of the next-best defense. We also demonstrate DeTorrent's practicality by deploying it alongside the Tor network and find that it maintains its performance when applied to live traffic.

> Individual differences in personality determine our preferences, traits and values, which should similarly hold for the way we express ourselves. With current advancements and transformations of technology and society, text-based communication has become ordinary and often even surpasses natural voice conversations -- with distinct challenges and opportunities. In this exploratory work, we investigate the impact of personality on the tendency how players of a team-based collaborative alternate reality game express themselves affectively. We collected chat logs from eleven players over two weeks, labeled them according to their affective state, and assessed the connection between them and the five-factor personality domains and facets. After applying multi-linear regression, we found a series of reasonable correlations between (combinations of) personality variables and expressed affect -- as increased confusion could be predicted by lower self-competence (C1), personal annoyance by vulnerability to stress (N6) and expressing anger occured more often in players that are prone to anxiety (N1), less humble and modest (A5), think less carefully before they act (C6) and have higher neuroticism (N). Expanding the data set, sample size and input modalities in subsequent work, we aim to confirm these findings and reveal even more interesting connections that could inform affective computing and games user research equally.

> Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance as few-shot learners. However, their security risks under such settings are largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a pilot study showing that PLMs as few-shot learners are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks while existing defenses are inadequate due to the unique challenges of few-shot scenarios. To address such challenges, we advocate MDP, a novel lightweight, pluggable, and effective defense for PLMs as few-shot learners. Specifically, MDP leverages the gap between the masking-sensitivity of poisoned and clean samples: with reference to the limited few-shot data as distributional anchors, it compares the representations of given samples under varying masking and identifies poisoned samples as ones with significant variations. We show analytically that MDP creates an interesting dilemma for the attacker to choose between attack effectiveness and detection evasiveness. The empirical evaluation using benchmark datasets and representative attacks validates the efficacy of MDP.

> Node injection attacks on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received increasing attention recently, due to their ability to degrade GNN performance with high attack success rates. However, our study indicates that these attacks often fail in practical scenarios, since defense/detection methods can easily identify and remove the injected nodes. To address this, we devote to camouflage node injection attack, making injected nodes appear normal and imperceptible to defense/detection methods. Unfortunately, the non-Euclidean structure of graph data and the lack of intuitive prior present great challenges to the formalization, implementation, and evaluation of camouflage. In this paper, we first propose and define camouflage as distribution similarity between ego networks of injected nodes and normal nodes. Then for implementation, we propose an adversarial CAmouflage framework for Node injection Attack, namely CANA, to improve attack performance under defense/detection methods in practical scenarios. A novel camouflage metric is further designed under the guide of distribution similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CANA can significantly improve the attack performance under defense/detection methods with higher camouflage or imperceptibility. This work urges us to raise awareness of the security vulnerabilities of GNNs in practical applications.

> Despite achieving great success, graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses focus on developing adversarial training or model modification. In this paper, we propose and formulate graph adversarial immunization, i.e., vaccinating part of graph structure to improve certifiable robustness of graph against any admissible adversarial attack. We first propose edge-level immunization to vaccinate node pairs. Unfortunately, such edge-level immunization cannot defend against emerging node injection attacks, since it only immunizes existing node pairs. To this end, we further propose node-level immunization. To avoid computationally intensive combinatorial optimization associated with adversarial immunization, we develop AdvImmune-Edge and AdvImmune-Node algorithms to effectively obtain the immune node pairs or nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdvImmune methods. In particular, AdvImmune-Node remarkably improves the ratio of robust nodes by 79%, 294%, and 100%, after immunizing only 5% of nodes. Furthermore, AdvImmune methods show excellent defensive performance against various attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art defenses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to improve certifiable robustness from graph data perspective without losing performance on clean graphs, providing new insights into graph adversarial learning.

> Driving behavior is considered a unique driving habit of each driver and has a significant impact on road safety. Classifying driving behavior and introducing policies based on the results can reduce the severity of crashes on the road. Roundabouts are particularly interesting because of the interconnected interaction between different road users at the area of roundabouts, which different driving behavior is hypothesized. This study investigates driving behavior at roundabouts in a mixed traffic environment using a data-driven unsupervised machine learning to classify driving behavior at three roundabouts in Germany. We used a dataset of vehicle kinematics to a group of different vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRUs) at roundabouts and classified them into three categories (i.e., conservative, normal, and aggressive). Results showed that most of the drivers proceeding through a roundabout can be mostly classified into two driving styles: conservative and normal because traffic speeds in roundabouts are relatively lower than in other signalized and unsignalized intersections. Results also showed that about 77% of drivers who interacted with pedestrians or cyclists were classified as conservative drivers compared to about 42% of conservative drivers that did not interact or about 51% from all drivers. It seems that drivers tend to behave abnormally as they interact with VRUs at roundabouts, which increases the risk of crashes when an intersection is multimodal. Results of this study could be helpful in improving the safety of roads by allowing policymakers to determine the effective and suitable safety countermeasures. Results will also be beneficial for the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) as the technology is being deployed in a mixed traffic environment.

> The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture's native virtualization and embedded intelligence facilitate RAN slicing and enable comprehensive end-to-end services in post-5G networks. However, any vulnerabilities could harm security. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) security threats can even threaten O-RAN benefits. This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating the optimal number of predefined VNFs for each slice while addressing secure AI/ML methods for dynamic service admission control and power minimization in the O-RAN architecture. We solve this problem on two-time scales using mathematical methods for determining the predefined number of VNFs on a large time scale and the proximal policy optimization (PPO), a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, for solving dynamic service admission control and power minimization for different slices on a small-time scale. To secure the ML system for O-RAN, we implement a moving target defense (MTD) strategy to prevent poisoning attacks by adding uncertainty to the system. Our experimental results show that the proposed PPO-based service admission control approach achieves an admission rate above 80\% and that the MTD strategy effectively strengthens the robustness of the PPO method against adversarial attacks.

> Misconfigured cloud storage buckets have leaked hundreds of millions of medical, voter, and customer records. These breaches are due to a combination of easily-guessable bucket names and error-prone security configurations, which, together, allow attackers to easily guess and access sensitive data. In this work, we investigate the security of buckets, finding that prior studies have largely underestimated cloud insecurity by focusing on simple, easy-to-guess names. By leveraging prior work in the password analysis space, we introduce Stratosphere, a system that learns how buckets are named in practice in order to efficiently guess the names of vulnerable buckets. Using Stratosphere, we find wide-spread exploitation of buckets and vulnerable configurations continuing to increase over the years. We conclude with recommendations for operators, researchers, and cloud providers.

> The spread of information through social media platforms can create environments possibly hostile to vulnerable communities and silence certain groups in society. To mitigate such instances, several models have been developed to detect hate and offensive speech. Since detecting hate and offensive speech in social media platforms could incorrectly exclude individuals from social media platforms, which can reduce trust, there is a need to create explainable and interpretable models. Thus, we build an explainable and interpretable high performance model based on the XGBoost algorithm, trained on Twitter data. For unbalanced Twitter data, XGboost outperformed the LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT models on hate speech detection with an F1 score of 0.75 compared to 0.38 and 0.37, and 0.38 respectively. When we down-sampled the data to three separate classes of approximately 5000 tweets, XGBoost performed better than LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT; with F1 scores for hate speech detection of 0.79 vs 0.69, 0.77, and 0.66 respectively. XGBoost also performed better than LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT in the down-sampled version for offensive speech detection with F1 score of 0.83 vs 0.88, 0.82, and 0.79 respectively. We use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) on our XGBoost models' outputs to makes it explainable and interpretable compared to LSTM, AutoGluon and ULMFiT that are black-box models.

> Randomized smoothing is the current state-of-the-art method for producing provably robust classifiers. While randomized smoothing typically yields robust $\ell_2$-ball certificates, recent research has generalized provable robustness to different norm balls as well as anisotropic regions. This work considers a classifier architecture that first projects onto a low-dimensional approximation of the data manifold and then applies a standard classifier. By performing randomized smoothing in the low-dimensional projected space, we characterize the certified region of our smoothed composite classifier back in the high-dimensional input space and prove a tractable lower bound on its volume. We show experimentally on CIFAR-10 and SVHN that classifiers without the initial projection are vulnerable to perturbations that are normal to the data manifold and yet are captured by the certified regions of our method. We compare the volume of our certified regions against various baselines and show that our method improves on the state-of-the-art by many orders of magnitude.

To enhance detection capabilities, we implement interval analysis on top of Slither [3], an existing detection tool, and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying certain vulnerabilities that other tools fail to detect.

Researchers have successfully developed methods that can extract typed keystrokes from ambient noise. As the prevalence of keyboard-based input systems continues to expand across various computing platforms, and with the improvement of microphone technology, the potential vulnerability to acoustic side-channel attacks also increases.

> A principal vulnerability of a proof-of-work ("PoW") blockchain is that an attacker can re-write the history of transactions by forking a previously published block and build a new chain segment containing a different sequence of transactions. If the attacker's chain has the most cumulative mining puzzle difficulty, nodes will recognize it as canonical. We propose a modification to PoW protocols, called ADESS, that contains two novel features. The first modification enables a node to identify the attacker chain by comparing the temporal sequence of blocks on competing chains. The second modification penalizes the attacker by requiring it to apply exponentially increasing hashrate in order to make its chain canonical. We demonstrate two things; (i) the expected cost of carrying out a double-spend attack is weakly higher under ADESS compared to the current PoW protocols and (ii) for any value of transaction, there is a penalty setting in ADESS that renders the expected profit of a double-spend attack negative.

> Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are more vulnerable to network attacks due to the high connectivity and diverse communication modes between vehicles and external networks. Deep learning-based Intrusion detection, an effective method for detecting network attacks, can provide functional safety as well as a real-time communication guarantee for vehicles, thereby being widely used for AVs. Existing works well for cyber-attacks such as simple-mode but become a higher false alarm with a resource-limited environment required when the attack is concealed within a contextual feature. In this paper, we present a novel automotive intrusion detection model with lightweight attribution and semantic fusion, named LSF-IDM. Our motivation is based on the observation that, when injected the malicious packets to the in-vehicle networks (IVNs), the packet log presents a strict order of context feature because of the periodicity and broadcast nature of the CAN bus. Therefore, this model first captures the context as the semantic feature of messages by the BERT language framework. Thereafter, the lightweight model (e.g., BiLSTM) learns the fused feature from an input packet's classification and its output distribution in BERT based on knowledge distillation. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in defending against several representative attacks from IVNs. We also perform the difference analysis of the proposed method with lightweight models and Bert to attain a deeper understanding of how the model balance detection performance and model complexity.

> Recent work has proposed stateful defense models (SDMs) as a compelling strategy to defend against a black-box attacker who only has query access to the model, as is common for online machine learning platforms. Such stateful defenses aim to defend against black-box attacks by tracking the query history and detecting and rejecting queries that are "similar" and thus preventing black-box attacks from finding useful gradients and making progress towards finding adversarial attacks within a reasonable query budget. Recent SDMs (e.g., Blacklight and PIHA) have shown remarkable success in defending against state-of-the-art black-box attacks. In this paper, we show that SDMs are highly vulnerable to a new class of adaptive black-box attacks. We propose a novel adaptive black-box attack strategy called Oracle-guided Adaptive Rejection Sampling (OARS) that involves two stages: (1) use initial query patterns to infer key properties about an SDM's defense; and, (2) leverage those extracted properties to design subsequent query patterns to evade the SDM's defense while making progress towards finding adversarial inputs. OARS is broadly applicable as an enhancement to existing black-box attacks - we show how to apply the strategy to enhance six common black-box attacks to be more effective against current class of SDMs. For example, OARS-enhanced versions of black-box attacks improved attack success rate against recent stateful defenses from almost 0% to to almost 100% for multiple datasets within reasonable query budgets.

> With the advancement of deep learning (DL) in various fields, there are many attempts to reveal software vulnerabilities by data-driven approach. Nonetheless, such existing works lack the effective representation that can retain the non-sequential semantic characteristics and contextual relationship of source code attributes. Hence, in this work, we propose XGV-BERT, a framework that combines the pre-trained CodeBERT model and Graph Neural Network (GCN) to detect software vulnerabilities. By jointly training the CodeBERT and GCN modules within XGV-BERT, the proposed model leverages the advantages of large-scale pre-training, harnessing vast raw data, and transfer learning by learning representations for training data through graph convolution. The research results demonstrate that the XGV-BERT method significantly improves vulnerability detection accuracy compared to two existing methods such as VulDeePecker and SySeVR. For the VulDeePecker dataset, XGV-BERT achieves an impressive F1-score of 97.5%, significantly outperforming VulDeePecker, which achieved an F1-score of 78.3%. Again, with the SySeVR dataset, XGV-BERT achieves an F1-score of 95.5%, surpassing the results of SySeVR with an F1-score of 83.5%.

> Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) embedded in IoT devices provide a deployable solution to secure IoT applications at the hardware level. By design, in TEEs, the Trusted Operating System (Trusted OS) is the primary component. It enables the TEE to use security-based design techniques, such as data encryption and identity authentication. Once a Trusted OS has been exploited, the TEE can no longer ensure security. However, Trusted OSes for IoT devices have received little security analysis, which is challenging from several perspectives: (1) Trusted OSes are closed-source and have an unfavorable environment for sending test cases and collecting feedback. (2) Trusted OSes have complex data structures and require a stateful workflow, which limits existing vulnerability detection tools. To address the challenges, we present SyzTrust, the first state-aware fuzzing framework for vetting the security of resource-limited Trusted OSes. SyzTrust adopts a hardware-assisted framework to enable fuzzing Trusted OSes directly on IoT devices as well as tracking state and code coverage non-invasively. SyzTrust utilizes composite feedback to guide the fuzzer to effectively explore more states as well as to increase the code coverage. We evaluate SyzTrust on Trusted OSes from three major vendors: Samsung, Tsinglink Cloud, and Ali Cloud. These systems run on Cortex M23/33 MCUs, which provide the necessary abstraction for embedded TEEs. We discovered 70 previously unknown vulnerabilities in their Trusted OSes, receiving 10 new CVEs so far. Furthermore, compared to the baseline, SyzTrust has demonstrated significant improvements, including 66% higher code coverage, 651% higher state coverage, and 31% improved vulnerability-finding capability. We report all discovered new vulnerabilities to vendors and open source SyzTrust.

> Programmers often struggle to identify and fix bugs in their programs. In recent years, many language models (LMs) have been proposed to fix erroneous programs and support error recovery. However, the LMs tend to generate solutions that differ from the original input programs. This leads to potential comprehension difficulties for users. In this paper, we propose an approach to suggest a correct program with minimal repair edits using CodeT5. We fine-tune a pre-trained CodeT5 on code pairs of wrong and correct programs and evaluate its performance with several baseline models. The experimental results show that the fine-tuned CodeT5 achieves a pass@100 of 91.95% and an average edit distance of the most similar correct program of 6.84, which indicates that at least one correct program can be suggested by generating 100 candidate programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LMs in suggesting program repair with minimal edits for solving introductory programming problems.

> Since the origins of the Internet, various vulnerabilities exploiting the IP fragmentation process have plagued IPv4 protocol, many leading to a wide range of attacks. IPv6 modified the handling of fragmentations and introduced a specific extension header, not solving the related problems, as proved by extensive literature. One of the primary sources of problems has been the overlapping fragments, which result in unexpected or malicious packets when reassembled. To overcome the problem related to fragmentation, the authors of RFC 5722 decided that IPv6 hosts MUST silently drop overlapping fragments.   Since then, several studies have proposed methodologies to check if IPv6 hosts accept overlapping fragments and are still vulnerable to related attacks. However, some of the above methodologies have not been proven complete or need to be more accurate. In this paper we propose a novel model to check IPv6 fragmentation handling specifically suited for the reassembling strategies of modern operating systems. Previous models, indeed, considered OS reassembly policy as byte-based. However, nowadays, reassembly policies are fragment-based, making previous models inadequate. Our model leverages the commutative property of the checksum, simplifying the whole assessing process. Starting with this new model, we were able to better evaluate the RFC-5722 and RFC-9099 compliance of modern operating systems against fragmentation handling. Our results suggest that IPv6 fragmentation can still be considered a threat and that more effort is needed to solve related security issues.

> The development of open-source software (OSS) projects usually have been driven through collaborations among contributors and strongly relies on volunteering. Thus, allocating software practitioners (e.g., contributors) to a particular task is non-trivial and draws attention away from the development. Therefore, a number of bug bounty platforms have emerged to address this problem through bounty rewards. Especially, Gitcoin, a new bounty platform, introduces a bounty reward mechanism that allows individual issue owners (backers) to define a reward value using cryptocurrencies rather than using crowdfunding mechanisms. Although a number of studies have investigated the phenomenon on bounty platforms, those rely on different bounty reward systems. Our study thus investigates the association between the Gitcoin bounties and their outcomes (i.e., success and non-success). We empirically study over 4,000 issues with Gitcoin bounties using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. We also conducted a comparative study with the Bountysource platform to gain insights into the usage of both platforms. Our study highlights the importance of factors such as the length of the project, issue description, type of bounty issue, and the bounty value, which are found to be highly correlated with the outcome of bounty issues. These findings can provide useful guidance to practitioners.

> Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress made in large language models (LLMs). Such advancements, while garnering significant attention, have concurrently elicited various concerns. The potential of these models is undeniably vast; however, they may yield texts that are imprecise, misleading, or even detrimental. Consequently, it becomes paramount to employ alignment techniques to ensure these models to exhibit behaviors consistent with human values.   This survey endeavors to furnish an extensive exploration of alignment methodologies designed for LLMs, in conjunction with the extant capability research in this domain. Adopting the lens of AI alignment, we categorize the prevailing methods and emergent proposals for the alignment of LLMs into outer and inner alignment. We also probe into salient issues including the models' interpretability, and potential vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. To assess LLM alignment, we present a wide variety of benchmarks and evaluation methodologies. After discussing the state of alignment research for LLMs, we finally cast a vision toward the future, contemplating the promising avenues of research that lie ahead.   Our aspiration for this survey extends beyond merely spurring research interests in this realm. We also envision bridging the gap between the AI alignment research community and the researchers engrossed in the capability exploration of LLMs for both capable and safe LLMs.

> One of the most pressing threats to computing systems is software vulnerabilities, which can compromise both hardware and software components. Existing methods for vulnerability detection remain suboptimal. Traditional techniques are both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while machine-learning-based approaches often underperform when applied to complex datasets, due to their inability to capture high-dimensional relationships. Previous deep-learning strategies also fall short in capturing sufficient feature information. Although self-attention mechanisms can process information over long distances, they fail to capture structural information. In this paper, we introduce DefectHunter, an innovative model for vulnerability identification that employs the Conformer mechanism. This mechanism fuses self-attention with convolutional networks to capture both local, position-wise features and global, content-based interactions. Furthermore, we optimize the self-attention mechanisms to mitigate the issue of excessive attention heads introducing extraneous noise by adjusting the denominator. We evaluated DefectHunter against ten baseline methods using six industrial and two highly complex datasets. On the QEMU dataset, DefectHunter exhibited a 20.62\% improvement in accuracy over Pongo-70B, and for the CWE-754 dataset, its accuracy was 14.64\% higher. To investigate how DefectHunter comprehends vulnerabilities, we conducted a case study, which revealed that our model effectively understands the mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities.

> Due to the drawbacks of Federated Learning (FL) such as vulnerability of a single central server, centralized federated learning is shifting to decentralized federated learning, a paradigm which takes the advantages of blockchain. A key enabler for adoption of blockchain-based federated learning is how to select suitable participants to train models collaboratively. Selecting participants by storing and querying the metadata of data owners on blockchain could ensure the reliability of selected data owners, which is helpful to obtain high-quality models in FL. However, querying multi-dimensional metadata on blockchain needs to traverse every transaction in each block, making the query time-consuming. An efficient query method for multi-dimensional metadata in the blockchain for selecting participants in FL is absent and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel data structure to improve the query efficiency within each block named MerkleRB-Tree. In detail, we leverage Minimal Bounding Rectangle(MBR) and bloom-filters for the query process of multi-dimensional continuous-valued attributes and discrete-valued attributes respectively. Furthermore, we migrate the idea of the skip list along with an MBR and a bloom filter at the head of each block to enhance the query efficiency for inter-blocks. The performance analysis and extensive evaluation results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method in blockchain-based FL.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made rapid developments in the recent years. Due to their great ability in modeling graph-structured data, GNNs are vastly used in various applications, including high-stakes scenarios such as financial analysis, traffic predictions, and drug discovery. Despite their great potential in benefiting humans in the real world, recent study shows that GNNs can leak private information, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, can inherit and magnify societal bias from training data and lack interpretability, which have risk of causing unintentional harm to the users and society. For example, existing works demonstrate that attackers can fool the GNNs to give the outcome they desire with unnoticeable perturbation on training graph. GNNs trained on social networks may embed the discrimination in their decision process, strengthening the undesirable societal bias. Consequently, trustworthy GNNs in various aspects are emerging to prevent the harm from GNN models and increase the users' trust in GNNs. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of GNNs in the computational aspects of privacy, robustness, fairness, and explainability. For each aspect, we give the taxonomy of the related methods and formulate the general frameworks for the multiple categories of trustworthy GNNs. We also discuss the future research directions of each aspect and connections between these aspects to help achieve trustworthiness.

> In order to assess the risks of a network system, it is important to investigate the behaviors of attackers after successful exploitation, which is called post-exploitation. Although there are various efficient tools supporting post-exploitation implementation, no application can automate this process. Most of the steps of this process are completed by experts who have profound knowledge of security, known as penetration testers or pen-testers. To this end, our study proposes the Raij\=u framework, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven automation approach that assists pen-testers in quickly implementing the process of post-exploitation for security-level evaluation in network systems. We implement two RL algorithms, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train specialized agents capable of making intelligent actions, which are Metasploit modules to automatically launch attacks of privileges escalation, gathering hashdump, and lateral movement. By leveraging RL, we aim to empower these agents with the ability to autonomously select and execute actions that can exploit vulnerabilities in target systems. This approach allows us to automate certain aspects of the penetration testing workflow, making it more efficient and responsive to emerging threats and vulnerabilities. The experiments are performed in four real environments with agents trained in thousands of episodes. The agents automatically select actions and launch attacks on the environments and achieve over 84\% of successful attacks with under 55 attack steps given. Moreover, the A2C algorithm has proved extremely effective in the selection of proper actions for automation of post-exploitation.

> The swift advancement in the scales and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) positions them as promising tools for a variety of downstream tasks. In addition to the pursuit of better performance and the avoidance of violent feedback on a certain prompt, to ensure the responsibility of the LLM, much attention is drawn to the robustness of LLMs. However, existing evaluation methods mostly rely on traditional question answering datasets with predefined supervised labels, which do not align with the superior generation capabilities of contemporary LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel rational evaluation approach that leverages pre-trained reward models as diagnostic tools to evaluate the longer conversation generated from more challenging open questions by LLMs, which we refer to as the Reward Model for Reasonable Robustness Evaluation (TREvaL). Longer conversations manifest the comprehensive grasp of language models in terms of their proficiency in understanding questions, a capability not entirely encompassed by individual words or letters, which may exhibit oversimplification and inherent biases. Our extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that TREvaL provides an innovative method for evaluating the robustness of an LLM. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that LLMs frequently exhibit vulnerability to word-level perturbations that are commonplace in daily language usage. Notably, we are surprised to discover that robustness tends to decrease as fine-tuning (SFT and RLHF) is conducted. The code of TREval is available in https://github.com/Harry-mic/TREvaL.

- `2305.00584v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00584v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00584v2)

> RISC-V is an emerging technology, with applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance servers. Therefore, more and more security-critical workloads will be conducted with code that is compiled for RISC-V. Well-known microarchitectural side-channel attacks against established platforms like x86 apply to RISC-V CPUs as well. As RISC-V does not mandate any hardware-based side-channel countermeasures, a piece of code compiled for a generic RISC-V CPU in a cloud server cannot make safe assumptions about the microarchitecture on which it is running. Existing tools for aiding software-level precautions by checking side-channel vulnerabilities on source code or x86 binaries are not compatible with RISC-V machine code.   In this work, we study the requirements and goals of architecture-specific leakage analysis for RISC-V and illustrate how to achieve these goals with the help of fast and precise dynamic binary analysis. We implement all necessary building blocks for finding side-channel leakages on RISC-V, while relying on existing mature solutions when possible. Our leakage analysis builds upon the modular side-channel analysis framework Microwalk, that examines execution traces for leakage through secret-dependent memory accesses or branches. To provide suitable traces, we port the ARM dynamic binary instrumentation tool MAMBO to RISC-V. Our port named MAMBO-V can instrument arbitrary binaries which use the 64-bit general purpose instruction set. We evaluate our toolchain on several cryptographic libraries with RISC-V support and identify multiple exploitable leakages.

> In recent times, the research works relating to smart traffic infrastructure have gained serious attention. As a result, research has been carried out in multiple directions to ensure that such infrastructure can improve upon our existing (mostly) human-controlled traffic infrastructure, without violating the safety margins. For this reason, cyber security issues of such infrastructure are of paramount interest. Keeping this in mind, we conduct a review of existing models, their vulnerabilities and how such vulnerabilities can be handled. Our work covers a vast area from the domain of security, starting from the theoretical notions of cryptography to the real-life adaptation of them. At the same time, we also consider the security issues that may arise due to the usage of artificial intelligence/machine learning in the infrastructure. We believe that our work will help future researchers to gain a comprehensive yet concise look at cyber security for smart traffic infrastructure.

- `2309.15606v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15606v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15606v1)

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in automatic code generation by improving coding efficiency to a certain extent. However, generating high-quality and reliable code remains a formidable task because of LLMs' lack of good programming practice, especially in exception handling. In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study and summarise three crucial challenges of LLMs in exception handling, i.e., incomplete exception handling, incorrect exception handling and abuse of try-catch. We then try prompts with different granularities to address such challenges, finding fine-grained knowledge-driven prompts works best. Based on our empirical study, we propose a novel Knowledge-driven Prompt Chaining-based code generation approach, name KPC, which decomposes code generation into an AI chain with iterative check-rewrite steps and chains fine-grained knowledge-driven prompts to assist LLMs in considering exception-handling specifications. We evaluate our KPC-based approach with 3,079 code generation tasks extracted from the Java official API documentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the KPC-based approach has considerable potential to ameliorate the quality of code generated by LLMs. It achieves this through proficiently managing exceptions and obtaining remarkable enhancements of 109.86% and 578.57% with static evaluation methods, as well as a reduction of 18 runtime bugs in the sampled dataset with dynamic validation.

> Motivation: Technical debt is a metaphor that describes not-quite-right code introduced for short-term needs. Developers are aware of it and admit it in source code comments, which is called Self- Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Therefore, SATD indicates weak code that developers are aware of. Problem statement: Inspecting source code is time-consuming; automatically inspecting source code for its vulnerabilities is a crucial aspect of developing software. It helps practitioners reduce the time-consuming process and focus on vulnerable aspects of the source code. Proposal: Accurately identify and better understand the semantics of self-admitted technical debt (SATD) by leveraging NLP and NL-PL approaches to detect vulnerabilities and the related SATD. Finally, a CI/CD pipeline will be proposed to make the vulnerability discovery process easily accessible to practitioners.

> Federated learning enables multiple clients to collaboratively contribute to the learning of a global model orchestrated by a central server. This learning scheme promotes clients' data privacy and requires reduced communication overheads. In an application like network traffic classification, this helps hide the network vulnerabilities and weakness points. However, federated learning is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which adversaries inject manipulated model updates into the global model. These updates inject a salient functionality in the global model that can be launched with specific input patterns. Nonetheless, the vulnerability of network traffic classification models based on federated learning to these attacks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose GABAttack, a novel genetic algorithm-based backdoor attack against federated learning for network traffic classification. GABAttack utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize the values and locations of backdoor trigger patterns, ensuring a better fit with the input and the model. This input-tailored dynamic attack is promising for improved attack evasiveness while being effective. Extensive experiments conducted over real-world network datasets validate the success of the proposed GABAttack in various situations while maintaining almost invisible activity. This research serves as an alarming call for network security experts and practitioners to develop robust defense measures against such attacks.

- `2308.02711v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02711v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02711v2)

> Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI) plays a vital role in ensuring secure and privacy-preserving communication in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, current VPKI architectures face significant challenges in terms of scalability, resilience, and privacy preservation. This paper proposes a novel threshold-based VPKI architecture to overcome these limitations. Leveraging a Schnorr threshold signature scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography, the proposed architecture eliminates the reliance on individual certificate authorities (CAs) and distributes trust among multiple CAs in a threshold certificate signing approach. This enhances resilience and mitigates the single point-of-failure vulnerability. The architecture also addresses sybil-based misbehaviors through a time-restrictive pseudonym design that eliminates multiple simultaneous use of pseudonyms. Furthermore, the scheme reduces the size and latency of Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution by clustering multiple CAs in a threshold setting and adopting a region-specific CRL. The paper presents detailed analysis of the security, privacy and performance benefits of the proposed architecture. Results from the performance evaluation shows the improved resiliency, reduced handover rates, and better scalability potential of the proposed threshold-based VPKI architecture compared to existing techniques. The proposed threshold-based VPKI holds great promise in ensuring secure and privacy-preserving communication in VANETs, paving the way for safer and more efficient vehicular networks.

> This position paper explores the broad landscape of AI potentiality in the context of cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis on its possible risk factors with awareness, which can be managed by incorporating human experts in the loop, i.e., "Human-AI" teaming. As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies advance, they will provide unparalleled opportunities for attack identification, incident response, and recovery. However, the successful deployment of AI into cybersecurity measures necessitates an in-depth understanding of its capabilities, challenges, and ethical and legal implications to handle associated risk factors in real-world application areas. Towards this, we emphasize the importance of a balanced approach that incorporates AI's computational power with human expertise. AI systems may proactively discover vulnerabilities and detect anomalies through pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, significantly enhancing speed and accuracy. Human experts can explain AI-generated decisions to stakeholders, regulators, and end-users in critical situations, ensuring responsibility and accountability, which helps establish trust in AI-driven security solutions. Therefore, in this position paper, we argue that human-AI teaming is worthwhile in cybersecurity, in which human expertise such as intuition, critical thinking, or contextual understanding is combined with AI's computational power to improve overall cyber defenses.

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-level performance on a vast spectrum of natural language tasks. However, few studies have addressed the LLM threat and vulnerability from an ideology perspective, especially when they are increasingly being deployed in sensitive domains, e.g., elections and education. In this study, we explore the implications of GPT soft ideologization through the use of AI-self-consciousness. By utilizing GPT self-conversations, AI can be granted a vision to "comprehend" the intended ideology, and subsequently generate finetuning data for LLM ideology injection. When compared to traditional government ideology manipulation techniques, such as information censorship, LLM ideologization proves advantageous; it is easy to implement, cost-effective, and powerful, thus brimming with risks.

> Neural networks have achieved remarkable performance across various problem domains, but their widespread applicability is hindered by inherent limitations such as overconfidence in predictions, lack of interpretability, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as a compelling extension of conventional neural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive capabilities.   This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the fundamental concepts of neural networks and Bayesian inference, elucidating their synergistic integration for the development of BNNs. The target audience comprises statisticians with a potential background in Bayesian methods but lacking deep learning expertise, as well as machine learners proficient in deep neural networks but with limited exposure to Bayesian statistics. We provide an overview of commonly employed priors, examining their impact on model behavior and performance. Additionally, we delve into the practical considerations associated with training and inference in BNNs.   Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research, acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also illuminates the potential applications of this dynamic field. As a valuable resource, it fosters an understanding of BNNs and their promising prospects, facilitating further advancements in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.

> Diffusion models recently have been successfully applied for the visual synthesis of strikingly realistic appearing images. This raises strong concerns about their potential for malicious purposes. In this paper, we propose using the lightweight multi Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (multiLID), which has been originally developed in context of the detection of adversarial examples, for the automatic detection of synthetic images and the identification of the according generator networks. In contrast to many existing detection approaches, which often only work for GAN-generated images, the proposed method provides close to perfect detection results in many realistic use cases. Extensive experiments on known and newly created datasets demonstrate that the proposed multiLID approach exhibits superiority in diffusion detection and model identification. Since the empirical evaluations of recent publications on the detection of generated images are often mainly focused on the "LSUN-Bedroom" dataset, we further establish a comprehensive benchmark for the detection of diffusion-generated images, including samples from several diffusion models with different image sizes.

> Generative large language models (LLMs) with instruct training such as GPT-4 can follow human-provided instruction prompts and generate human-like responses to these prompts. Apart from natural language responses, they have also been found to be effective at generating formal artifacts such as code, plans, and logical specifications from natural language prompts. Despite their remarkably improved accuracy, these models are still known to produce factually incorrect or contextually inappropriate results despite their syntactic coherence - a phenomenon often referred to as hallucination. This limitation makes it difficult to use these models to synthesize formal artifacts that are used in safety-critical applications. Unlike tasks such as text summarization and question-answering, bugs in code, plan, and other formal artifacts produced by LLMs can be catastrophic. We posit that we can use the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers as deductive reasoning engines to analyze the generated solutions from the LLMs, produce counterexamples when the solutions are incorrect, and provide that feedback to the LLMs exploiting the dialog capability of instruct-trained LLMs. This interaction between inductive LLMs and deductive SMT solvers can iteratively steer the LLM to generate the correct response. In our experiments, we use planning over the domain of blocks as our synthesis task for evaluating our approach. We use GPT-4, GPT3.5 Turbo, Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada as the LLMs and Z3 as the SMT solver. Our method allows the user to communicate the planning problem in natural language; even the formulation of queries to SMT solvers is automatically generated from natural language. Thus, the proposed technique can enable non-expert users to describe their problems in natural language, and the combination of LLMs and SMT solvers can produce provably correct solutions.

> Formal property verification (FPV) has existed for decades and has been shown to be effective at finding intricate RTL bugs. However, formal properties, such as those written as SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA), are time-consuming and error-prone to write, even for experienced users. Prior work has attempted to lighten this burden by raising the abstraction level so that SVA is generated from high-level specifications. However, this does not eliminate the manual effort of reasoning and writing about the detailed hardware behavior. Motivated by the increased need for FPV in the era of heterogeneous hardware and the advances in large language models (LLMs), we set out to explore whether LLMs can capture RTL behavior and generate correct SVA properties.   First, we design an FPV-based evaluation framework that measures the correctness and completeness of SVA. Then, we evaluate GPT4 iteratively to craft the set of syntax and semantic rules needed to prompt it toward creating better SVA. We extend the open-source AutoSVA framework by integrating our improved GPT4-based flow to generate safety properties, in addition to facilitating their existing flow for liveness properties. Lastly, our use cases evaluate (1) the FPV coverage of GPT4-generated SVA on complex open-source RTL and (2) using generated SVA to prompt GPT4 to create RTL from scratch.   Through these experiments, we find that GPT4 can generate correct SVA even for flawed RTL, without mirroring design errors. Particularly, it generated SVA that exposed a bug in the RISC-V CVA6 core that eluded the prior work's evaluation.

> Testing with randomly generated inputs (fuzzing) has gained significant traction due to its capacity to expose program vulnerabilities automatically. Fuzz testing campaigns generate large amounts of data, making them ideal for the application of machine learning (ML). Neural program smoothing (NPS), a specific family of ML-guided fuzzers, aims to use a neural network as a smooth approximation of the program target for new test case generation.   In this paper, we conduct the most extensive evaluation of NPS fuzzers against standard gray-box fuzzers (>11 CPU years and >5.5 GPU years), and make the following contributions: (1) We find that the original performance claims for NPS fuzzers do not hold; a gap we relate to fundamental, implementation, and experimental limitations of prior works. (2) We contribute the first in-depth analysis of the contribution of machine learning and gradient-based mutations in NPS. (3) We implement Neuzz++, which shows that addressing the practical limitations of NPS fuzzers improves performance, but that standard gray-box fuzzers almost always surpass NPS-based fuzzers. (4) As a consequence, we propose new guidelines targeted at benchmarking fuzzing based on machine learning, and present MLFuzz, a platform with GPU access for easy and reproducible evaluation of ML-based fuzzers. Neuzz++, MLFuzz, and all our data are public.

> Neural networks perform exceedingly well across various machine learning tasks but are not immune to adversarial perturbations. This vulnerability has implications for real-world applications. While much research has been conducted, the underlying reasons why neural networks fall prey to adversarial attacks are not yet fully understood. Central to our study, which explores up to five attack algorithms across three datasets, is the identification of human-identifiable features in adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we uncover two distinct effects manifesting within human-identifiable features. Specifically, the masking effect is prominent in untargeted attacks, while the generation effect is more common in targeted attacks. Using pixel-level annotations, we extract such features and demonstrate their ability to compromise target models. In addition, our findings indicate a notable extent of similarity in perturbations across different attack algorithms when averaged over multiple models. This work also provides insights into phenomena associated with adversarial perturbations, such as transferability and model interpretability. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind adversarial attacks and offers insights for the development of more resilient defense strategies for neural networks.

> The security vulnerability of the Vadai, Mingesz, and Gingl (VMG) Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) key exchanger, as presented in the publication "Nature, Science Report 5 (2015) 13653," has been exposed to transient attacks. Recently an effective defense protocol was introduced (Appl. Phys. Lett. 122 (2023) 143503) to counteract mean-square voltage-based (or mean-square current-based) transient attacks targeted at the ideal KLJN framework.   In the present study, this same mitigation methodology has been employed to fortify the security of the VMG-KLJN key exchanger. It is worth noting that the protective measures need to be separately implemented for the HL and LH scenarios. This conceptual framework is corroborated through computer simulations, demonstrating that the application of this defensive technique substantially mitigates information leakage to a point of insignificance.

> Large language models (LLMs) have broad medical knowledge and can reason about medical information across many domains, holding promising potential for diverse medical applications in the near future. In this study, we demonstrate a concerning vulnerability of LLMs in medicine. Through targeted manipulation of just 1.1% of the model's weights, we can deliberately inject an incorrect biomedical fact. The erroneous information is then propagated in the model's output, whilst its performance on other biomedical tasks remains intact. We validate our findings in a set of 1,038 incorrect biomedical facts. This peculiar susceptibility raises serious security and trustworthiness concerns for the application of LLMs in healthcare settings. It accentuates the need for robust protective measures, thorough verification mechanisms, and stringent management of access to these models, ensuring their reliable and safe use in medical practice.

> Many individuals are likely to face a legal dispute at some point in their lives, but their lack of understanding of how to navigate these complex issues often renders them vulnerable. The advancement of natural language processing opens new avenues for bridging this legal literacy gap through the development of automated legal aid systems. However, existing legal question answering (LQA) approaches often suffer from a narrow scope, being either confined to specific legal domains or limited to brief, uninformative responses. In this work, we propose an end-to-end methodology designed to generate long-form answers to any statutory law questions, utilizing a "retrieve-then-read" pipeline. To support this approach, we introduce and release the Long-form Legal Question Answering (LLeQA) dataset, comprising 1,868 expert-annotated legal questions in the French language, complete with detailed answers rooted in pertinent legal provisions. Our experimental results demonstrate promising performance on automatic evaluation metrics, but a qualitative analysis uncovers areas for refinement. As one of the only comprehensive, expert-annotated long-form LQA dataset, LLeQA has the potential to not only accelerate research towards resolving a significant real-world issue, but also act as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating NLP models in specialized domains. We publicly release our code, data, and models.

> The growing global elderly population is expected to increase the prevalence of frailty, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems. Frailty, a syndrome associated with ageing, is characterised by progressive health decline, increased vulnerability to stressors and increased risk of mortality. It represents a significant burden on public health and reduces the quality of life of those affected. The lack of a universally accepted method to assess frailty and a standardised definition highlights a critical research gap. Given this lack and the importance of early prevention, this study presents an innovative approach using an instrumented ink pen to ecologically assess handwriting for age group classification. Content-free handwriting data from 80 healthy participants in different age groups (20-40, 41-60, 61-70 and 70+) were analysed. Fourteen gesture- and tremor-related indicators were computed from the raw data and used in five classification tasks. These tasks included discriminating between adjacent and non-adjacent age groups using Catboost and Logistic Regression classifiers. Results indicate exceptional classifier performance, with accuracy ranging from 82.5% to 97.5%, precision from 81.8% to 100%, recall from 75% to 100% and ROC-AUC from 92.2% to 100%. Model interpretability, facilitated by SHAP analysis, revealed age-dependent sensitivity of temporal and tremor-related handwriting features. Importantly, this classification method offers potential for early detection of abnormal signs of ageing in uncontrolled settings such as remote home monitoring, thereby addressing the critical issue of frailty detection and contributing to improved care for older adults.

- *Yichang Xu, Chenwang Wu, Defu Lian*

- `2309.17278v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17278v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17278v1)

> Recommender systems have been shown to be vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious data is injected into the dataset to cause the recommender system to provide biased recommendations. To defend against such attacks, various robust learning methods have been proposed. However, most methods are model-specific or attack-specific, making them lack generality, while other methods, such as adversarial training, are oriented towards evasion attacks and thus have a weak defense strength in poisoning attacks.   In this paper, we propose a general method, Real-time Vicinal Defense (RVD), which leverages neighboring training data to fine-tune the model before making a recommendation for each user. RVD works in the inference phase to ensure the robustness of the specific sample in real-time, so there is no need to change the model structure and training process, making it more practical. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RVD effectively mitigates targeted poisoning attacks across various models without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, the defensive effect can be further amplified when our method is combined with other strategies.

<summary>2023-09-29 19:38:40 - Practical Membership Inference Attacks Against Large-Scale Multi-Modal Models: A Pilot Study</summary>

> Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to infer whether a data point has been used to train a machine learning model. These attacks can be employed to identify potential privacy vulnerabilities and detect unauthorized use of personal data. While MIAs have been traditionally studied for simple classification models, recent advancements in multi-modal pre-training, such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot performance across a range of computer vision tasks. However, the sheer scale of data and models presents significant computational challenges for performing the attacks.   This paper takes a first step towards developing practical MIAs against large-scale multi-modal models. We introduce a simple baseline strategy by thresholding the cosine similarity between text and image features of a target point and propose further enhancing the baseline by aggregating cosine similarity across transformations of the target. We also present a new weakly supervised attack method that leverages ground-truth non-members (e.g., obtained by using the publication date of a target model and the timestamps of the open data) to further enhance the attack. Our evaluation shows that CLIP models are susceptible to our attack strategies, with our simple baseline achieving over $75\%$ membership identification accuracy. Furthermore, our enhanced attacks outperform the baseline across multiple models and datasets, with the weakly supervised attack demonstrating an average-case performance improvement of $17\%$ and being at least $7$X more effective at low false-positive rates. These findings highlight the importance of protecting the privacy of multi-modal foundational models, which were previously assumed to be less susceptible to MIAs due to less overfitting. Our code is available at https://github.com/ruoxi-jia-group/CLIP-MIA.

> This paper performs the first study to understand the prevalence, challenges, and effectiveness of using Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools on Open-Source Embedded Software (EMBOSS) repositories. We collect a corpus of 258 of the most popular EMBOSS projects, representing 13 distinct categories such as real-time operating systems, network stacks, and applications. To understand the current use of SAST tools on EMBOSS, we measured this corpus and surveyed developers. To understand the challenges and effectiveness of using SAST tools on EMBOSS projects, we applied these tools to the projects in our corpus. We report that almost none of these projects (just 3%) use SAST tools beyond those baked into the compiler, and developers give rationales such as ineffectiveness and false positives. In applying SAST tools ourselves, we show that minimal engineering effort and project expertise are needed to apply many tools to a given EMBOSS project. GitHub's CodeQL was the most effective SAST tool -- using its built-in security checks we found a total of 540 defects (with a false positive rate of 23%) across the 258 projects, with 399 (74%) likely security vulnerabilities, including in projects maintained by Microsoft, Amazon, and the Apache Foundation. EMBOSS engineers have confirmed 273 (51%) of these defects, mainly by accepting our pull requests. Two CVEs were issued. In summary, we urge EMBOSS engineers to adopt the current generation of SAST tools, which offer low false positive rates and are effective at finding security-relevant defects.

- *Hongsheng Hu, Xuyun Zhang, Zoran Salcic, Lichao Sun, Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo, Gillian Dobbie*

- `2310.00222v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00222v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00222v1)

> Federated learning (FL) is a popular approach to facilitate privacy-aware machine learning since it allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without granting others access to their private data. It is, however, known that FL can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where the training records of the global model can be distinguished from the testing records. Surprisingly, research focusing on the investigation of the source inference problem appears to be lacking. We also observe that identifying a training record's source client can result in privacy breaches extending beyond MIAs. For example, consider an FL application where multiple hospitals jointly train a COVID-19 diagnosis model, membership inference attackers can identify the medical records that have been used for training, and any additional identification of the source hospital can result the patient from the particular hospital more prone to discrimination. Seeking to contribute to the literature gap, we take the first step to investigate source privacy in FL. Specifically, we propose a new inference attack (hereafter referred to as source inference attack -- SIA), designed to facilitate an honest-but-curious server to identify the training record's source client. The proposed SIAs leverage the Bayesian theorem to allow the server to implement the attack in a non-intrusive manner without deviating from the defined FL protocol. We then evaluate SIAs in three different FL frameworks to show that in existing FL frameworks, the clients sharing gradients, model parameters, or predictions on a public dataset will leak such source information to the server. We also conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to investigate the key factors in an SIA. The experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed SIAs.

> Open source software (OSS) vulnerabilities threaten the security of software systems that use OSS. Vulnerability databases provide valuable information (e.g., vulnerable version and patch) to mitigate OSS vulnerabilities. There arises a growing concern about the information quality of vulnerability databases. However, it is unclear what the quality of patches in existing vulnerability databases is; and existing manual or heuristic-based approaches for patch tracking are either too expensive or too specific to apply to all OSS vulnerabilities.

> Many Transformer-based pre-trained models for code have been developed and applied to code-related tasks. In this paper, we review the existing literature, examine the suitability of model architectures for different tasks, and look at the generalization ability of models on different datasets, and their resource consumption.   We examine three very representative pre-trained models for code: CodeBERT, CodeGPT, and CodeT5, and conduct experiments on the top-4 most targeted software engineering tasks that we found in our literature survey: Code Summarization, Bug Fixing, Bug Detection, and Code Search. In our study, we showcase the capability of decoder-only models (CodeGPT) for specific generation tasks under state-of-the-art evaluation metrics and contest the common belief that the encoder-decoder architecture is optimal for general-purpose coding tasks. Additionally, we found that the most frequently used models are not necessarily the most suitable for certain applications and the developers' needs are not adequately addressed by current research. As well, we found that the benchmark and frequent dataset for Bug Fixing and Code Summarization both fail to enable models to generalize onto other datasets for the same task (the frequent dataset refers to the dataset with the highest frequency used in literature other than the benchmark). We use statistical testing to support our conclusions from experiments. Finally, CodeBERT is highly efficient for understanding tasks, whereas CodeT5's efficiency for generation tasks is in doubt, as the highest resource consumption does not guarantee a consistent better performance on different metrics. We also discuss the numerous practical issues in advancing future research on transformer-based models for code-related tasks.

- `2310.00567v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00567v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00567v1)

> Recent works have shown that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that find samples close to the original image but can make the model misclassify. Even with access only to the model's output, an attacker can employ black-box attacks to generate such adversarial examples. In this work, we propose a simple and lightweight defense against black-box attacks by adding random noise to hidden features at intermediate layers of the model at inference time. Our theoretical analysis confirms that this method effectively enhances the model's resilience against both score-based and decision-based black-box attacks. Importantly, our defense does not necessitate adversarial training and has minimal impact on accuracy, rendering it applicable to any pre-trained model. Our analysis also reveals the significance of selectively adding noise to different parts of the model based on the gradient of the adversarial objective function, which can be varied during the attack. We demonstrate the robustness of our defense against multiple black-box attacks through extensive empirical experiments involving diverse models with various architectures.

> Attack graphs are a tool for analyzing security vulnerabilities that capture different and prospective attacks on a system. As a threat modeling tool, it shows possible paths that an attacker can exploit to achieve a particular goal. However, due to the large number of vulnerabilities that are published on a daily basis, they have the potential to rapidly expand in size. Consequently, this necessitates a significant amount of resources to generate attack graphs. In addition, generating composited attack models for complex systems such as self-adaptive or AI is very difficult due to their nature to continuously change. In this paper, we present a novel fragment-based attack graph generation approach that utilizes information from publicly available information security databases. Furthermore, we also propose a domain-specific language for attack modeling, which we employ in the proposed attack graph generation approach. Finally, we present a demonstrator example showcasing the attack generator's capability to replicate a verified attack chain, as previously confirmed by security experts.

> Individuals, businesses, and governments all face additional difficulties because of the rise of sophisticated cyberattack attacks. This paper investigates the targeting of journalists and activists by the malware Pegasus. To gain a deeper understanding of the tactics utilized by cybercriminals and the vulnerabilities that facilitate their scope, this research looks on numerous occurrences and identifies recurring patterns in the strategies, methods, and practices employed. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on the far-reaching consequences of these attacks for cybersecurity policy, encompassing the pressing need for enhanced threat intelligence sharing mechanisms, the implementation of more resilient incident response protocols, and the allocation of greater financial resources towards the advancement of cybersecurity research and development initiatives. The research also discusses how Pegasus will affect SCADA systems and critical infrastructure, and it describes some of the most important tactics that businesses may use to reduce the danger of cyberattacks and safeguard themselves against the 21st century's growing threats.

> Deep learning-based vulnerability detection has shown great performance and, in some studies, outperformed static analysis tools. However, the highest-performing approaches use token-based transformer models, which are not the most efficient to capture code semantics required for vulnerability detection. Classical program analysis techniques such as dataflow analysis can detect many types of bugs based on their root causes. In this paper, we propose to combine such causal-based vulnerability detection algorithms with deep learning, aiming to achieve more efficient and effective vulnerability detection. Specifically, we designed DeepDFA, a dataflow analysis-inspired graph learning framework and an embedding technique that enables graph learning to simulate dataflow computation. We show that DeepDFA is both performant and efficient. DeepDFA outperformed all non-transformer baselines. It was trained in 9 minutes, 75x faster than the highest-performing baseline model. When using only 50+ vulnerable and several hundreds of total examples as training data, the model retained the same performance as 100% of the dataset. DeepDFA also generalized to real-world vulnerabilities in DbgBench; it detected 8.7 out of 17 vulnerabilities on average across folds and was able to distinguish between patched and buggy versions, while the highest-performing baseline models did not detect any vulnerabilities. By combining DeepDFA with a large language model, we surpassed the state-of-the-art vulnerability detection performance on the Big-Vul dataset with 96.46 F1 score, 97.82 precision, and 95.14 recall.

> The discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples can lead to \textit{distributional vulnerability} in deep neural networks, which can subsequently lead to high-confidence predictions for OOD samples. This is mainly due to the absence of OOD samples during training, which fails to constrain the network properly. To tackle this issue, several state-of-the-art methods include adding extra OOD samples to training and assign them with manually-defined labels. However, this practice can introduce unreliable labeling, negatively affecting ID classification. The distributional vulnerability presents a critical challenge for non-IID deep learning, which aims for OOD-tolerant ID classification by balancing ID generalization and OOD detection. In this paper, we introduce a novel \textit{supervision adaptation} approach to generate adaptive supervision information for OOD samples, making them more compatible with ID samples. Firstly, we measure the dependency between ID samples and their labels using mutual information, revealing that the supervision information can be represented in terms of negative probabilities across all classes. Secondly, we investigate data correlations between ID and OOD samples by solving a series of binary regression problems, with the goal of refining the supervision information for more distinctly separable ID classes. Our extensive experiments on four advanced network architectures, two ID datasets, and eleven diversified OOD datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our supervision adaptation approach in improving both ID classification and OOD detection capabilities.

> The digitization and decentralization of the electric power grid are key thrusts for an economically and environmentally sustainable future. Towards this goal, distributed energy resources (DER), including rooftop solar panels, battery storage, electric vehicles, etc., are becoming ubiquitous in power systems. Power utilities benefit from DERs as they minimize operational costs; at the same time, DERs grant users and aggregators control over the power they produce and consume. DERs are interconnected, interoperable, and support remotely controllable features, thus, their cybersecurity is of cardinal importance. DER communication dependencies and the diversity of DER architectures widen the threat surface and aggravate the cybersecurity posture of power systems. In this work, we focus on security oversights that reside in the cyber and physical layers of DERs and can jeopardize grid operations. Existing works have underlined the impact of cyberattacks targeting DER assets, however, they either focus on specific system components (e.g., communication protocols), do not consider the mission-critical objectives of DERs, or neglect the adversarial perspective (e.g., adversary/attack models) altogether. To address these omissions, we comprehensively analyze adversarial capabilities and objectives when manipulating DER assets, and then present how protocol and device-level vulnerabilities can materialize into cyberattacks impacting power system operations. Finally, we provide mitigation strategies to thwart adversaries and directions for future DER cybersecurity research.

> The Geometric Bin Packing (GBP) problem is a generalization of Bin Packing where the input is a set of $d$-dimensional rectangles, and the goal is to pack them into unit $d$-dimensional cubes efficiently. It is NP-Hard to obtain a PTAS for the problem, even when $d=2$. For general $d$, the best-known approximation algorithm has an approximation guarantee exponential in $d$, while the best hardness of approximation is still a small constant inapproximability from the case when $d=2$. In this paper, we show that the problem cannot be approximated within $d^{1-\epsilon}$ factor unless NP=ZPP.   Recently, $d$-dimensional Vector Bin Packing, a closely related problem to the GBP, was shown to be hard to approximate within $\Omega(\log d)$ when $d$ is a fixed constant, using a notion of Packing Dimension of set families. In this paper, we introduce a geometric analog of it, the Geometric Packing Dimension of set families. While we fall short of obtaining similar inapproximability results for the Geometric Bin Packing problem when $d$ is fixed, we prove a couple of key properties of the Geometric Packing Dimension which highlight fundamental differences between Geometric Bin Packing and Vector Bin Packing.

> The rapid growth and adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) systems have been accompanied by various threats, notably those emerging from vulnerabilities in their intricate design. In our work, we introduce and define an attack strategy termed as Role-Play Attack, in which the attacker acts as multiple roles concurrently to exploit the DeFi system and cause substantial financial losses. We provide a formal definition of this strategy and demonstrate its potential impacts by revealing the total loss of \$435.1M caused by 14 historical attacks with applying this pattern. Besides, we mathematically analyzed the attacks with top 2 losses and retrofitted the corresponding attack pattern by concrete execution, indicating that this strategy could increase the potential profit for original attacks by \$3.34M (51.4%) and \$3.76M (12.0%), respectively.

> The availability of public services through online platforms has improved the coverage and efficiency of essential services provided to citizens worldwide. These services also promote transparency and foster citizen participation in government processes. However, the increased online presence also exposes sensitive data exchanged between citizens and service providers to a wider range of security threats. Therefore, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of online services is crucial to Electronic Government (EGOV) initiatives' success. Hence, this work assesses the security posture of online platforms hosted in 3068 governmental domain names, across all UN Member States, in three dimensions: support for secure communication protocols; the trustworthiness of their digital certificate chains; and services' exposure to known vulnerabilities. The results indicate that despite its rapid development, the public sector still falls short in adopting international standards and best security practices in services and infrastructure management. This reality poses significant risks to citizens and services across all regions and income levels.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary maliciously manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a few validation data and model parameters, which are impractical in many real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service. In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test time, in particular for black-box models. The true label of every test image needs to be recovered on the fly from a suspicious model regardless of image benignity. We focus on test-time image purification methods that incapacitate possible triggers while keeping semantic contents intact. Due to diverse trigger patterns and sizes, the heuristic trigger search in image space can be unscalable. We circumvent such barrier by leveraging the strong reconstruction power of generative models, and propose a framework of Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). It detects possible triggers in the token space using image structural similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations. The detection results are then refined by considering trigger topology. Finally, we fuse MAE restorations adaptively into a purified image for making prediction. Our approach is blind to the model architectures, trigger patterns and image benignity. Extensive experiments under different backdoor settings validate its effectiveness and generalizability. Code is available at https://github.com/tsun/BDMAE.

> Multi-domain warfare is a military doctrine that leverages capabilities from different domains, including air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace, to create a highly interconnected battle network that is difficult for adversaries to disrupt or defeat. However, the adoption of 5G technologies on battlefields presents new vulnerabilities due to the complexity of interconnections and the diversity of software, hardware, and devices from different supply chains. Therefore, establishing a zero-trust architecture for 5G-enabled networks is crucial for continuous monitoring and fast data analytics to protect against targeted attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a proactive end-to-end security scheme that utilizes a 5G satellite-guided air-ground network. Our approach incorporates a decision-dominant learning-based method that can thwart the lateral movement of adversaries targeting critical assets on the battlefield before they can conduct reconnaissance or gain necessary access or credentials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our game-theoretic design, which uses a meta-learning framework to enable zero-trust monitoring and decision-dominant defense against attackers in emerging multi-domain battlefield networks.

> Fault Localization (FL) aims to automatically localize buggy lines of code, a key first step in many manual and automatic debugging tasks. Previous FL techniques assume the provision of input tests, and often require extensive program analysis, program instrumentation, or data preprocessing. Prior work on deep learning for APR struggles to learn from small datasets and produces limited results on real-world programs. Inspired by the ability of large language models (LLMs) of code to adapt to new tasks based on very few examples, we investigate the applicability of LLMs to line level fault localization. Specifically, we propose to overcome the left-to-right nature of LLMs by fine-tuning a small set of bidirectional adapter layers on top of the representations learned by LLMs to produce LLMAO, the first language model based fault localization approach that locates buggy lines of code without any test coverage information. We fine-tune LLMs with 350 million, 6 billion, and 16 billion parameters on small, manually curated corpora of buggy programs such as the Defects4J corpus. We observe that our technique achieves substantially more confidence in fault localization when built on the larger models, with bug localization performance scaling consistently with the LLM size. Our empirical evaluation shows that LLMAO improves the Top-1 results over the state-of-the-art machine learning fault localization (MLFL) baselines by 2.3%-54.4%, and Top-5 results by 14.4%-35.6%. LLMAO is also the first FL technique trained using a language model architecture that can detect security vulnerabilities down to the code line level.

> Developers often build software on top of third-party libraries (Libs) to improve programmer productivity and software quality. The libraries may contain vulnerabilities exploitable by hackers to attack the applications (Apps) built on top of them. People refer to such attacks as supply chain attacks, the documented number of which has increased 742% in 2022. People created tools to mitigate such attacks, by scanning the library dependencies of Apps, identifying the usage of vulnerable library versions, and suggesting secure alternatives to vulnerable dependencies. However, recent studies show that many developers do not trust the reports by these tools; they ask for code or evidence to demonstrate how library vulnerabilities lead to security exploits, in order to assess vulnerability severity and modification necessity. Unfortunately, manually crafting demos of application-specific attacks is challenging and time-consuming, and there is insufficient tool support to automate that procedure.   In this study, we used ChatGPT-4.0 to generate security tests, and to demonstrate how vulnerable library dependencies facilitate the supply chain attacks to given Apps. We explored various prompt styles/templates, and found that ChatGPT-4.0 generated tests for all 55 Apps, demonstrating 24 attacks successfully. It outperformed two state-of-the-art security test generators -- TRANSFER and SIEGE -- by generating a lot more tests and achieving more exploits. ChatGPT-4.0 worked better when prompts described more on the vulnerabilities, possible exploits, and code context. Our research will shed light on new research in security test generation. The generated tests will help developers create secure by design and secure by default software.

In addition, a prototype tool based on BugLocator was implemented and applied to two Japanese industrial projects, which resulted in a slightly different performance from that of Xia et al.

> To achieve reliable, robust, and safe AI systems, it is vital to implement fallback strategies when AI predictions cannot be trusted. Certifiers for neural networks are a reliable way to check the robustness of these predictions. They guarantee for some predictions that a certain class of manipulations or attacks could not have changed the outcome. For the remaining predictions without guarantees, the method abstains from making a prediction, and a fallback strategy needs to be invoked, which typically incurs additional costs, can require a human operator, or even fail to provide any prediction. While this is a key concept towards safe and secure AI, we show for the first time that this approach comes with its own security risks, as such fallback strategies can be deliberately triggered by an adversary. In addition to naturally occurring abstains for some inputs and perturbations, the adversary can use training-time attacks to deliberately trigger the fallback with high probability. This transfers the main system load onto the fallback, reducing the overall system's integrity and/or availability. We design two novel availability attacks, which show the practical relevance of these threats. For example, adding 1% poisoned data during training is sufficient to trigger the fallback and hence make the model unavailable for up to 100% of all inputs by inserting the trigger. Our extensive experiments across multiple datasets, model architectures, and certifiers demonstrate the broad applicability of these attacks. An initial investigation into potential defenses shows that current approaches are insufficient to mitigate the issue, highlighting the need for new, specific solutions.

> Security metrics are not standardized, but inter-national proposals such as the Common Vulnerability ScoringSystem (CVSS) for quantifying the severity of known vulnerabil-ities are widely used. Many CVSS aggregation mechanisms havebeen proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, factors related tothe context of the System Under Test (SUT) are not taken intoaccount in the aggregation process; vulnerabilities that in theoryaffect the SUT, but are not exploitable in reality. We propose aCVSS aggregation algorithm that integrates information aboutthe functionality disruption of the SUT, exploitation difficulty,existence of exploits, and the context where the SUT operates.The aggregation algorithm was applied to OpenPLC V3, showingthat it is capable of filtering out vulnerabilities that cannot beexploited in the real conditions of deployment of the particularsystem. Finally, because of the nature of the proposed algorithm,the result can be interpreted in the same way as a normal CVSS.

> Collaborative perception, which greatly enhances the sensing capability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by incorporating data from external resources, also brings forth potential security risks. CAVs' driving decisions rely on remote untrusted data, making them susceptible to attacks carried out by malicious participants in the collaborative perception system. However, security analysis and countermeasures for such threats are absent. To understand the impact of the vulnerability, we break the ground by proposing various real-time data fabrication attacks in which the attacker delivers crafted malicious data to victims in order to perturb their perception results, leading to hard brakes or increased collision risks. Our attacks demonstrate a high success rate of over 86% on high-fidelity simulated scenarios and are realizable in real-world experiments. To mitigate the vulnerability, we present a systematic anomaly detection approach that enables benign vehicles to jointly reveal malicious fabrication. It detects 91.5% of attacks with a false positive rate of 3% in simulated scenarios and significantly mitigates attack impacts in real-world scenarios.

> Large language models (LLMs), known for their capability in understanding and following instructions, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Researchers have found that current commercial LLMs either fail to be "harmless" by presenting unethical answers, or fail to be "helpful" by refusing to offer meaningful answers when faced with adversarial queries. To strike a balance between being helpful and harmless, we design a moving target defense (MTD) enhanced LLM system. The system aims to deliver non-toxic answers that align with outputs from multiple model candidates, making them more robust against adversarial attacks. We design a query and output analysis model to filter out unsafe or non-responsive answers. %to achieve the two objectives of randomly selecting outputs from different LLMs. We evaluate over 8 most recent chatbot models with state-of-the-art adversarial queries. Our MTD-enhanced LLM system reduces the attack success rate from 37.5\% to 0\%. Meanwhile, it decreases the response refusal rate from 50\% to 0\%.

> Securing operating system (OS) kernel is one central challenge in today's cyber security landscape. The cutting-edge testing technique of OS kernel is software fuzz testing. By mutating the program inputs with random variations for iterations, fuzz testing aims to trigger program crashes and hangs caused by potential bugs that can be abused by the inputs. To achieve high OS code coverage, the de facto OS fuzzer typically composes system call traces as the input seed to mutate and to interact with OS kernels. Hence, quality and diversity of the employed system call traces become the prominent factor to decide the effectiveness of OS fuzzing. However, these system call traces to date are generated with hand-coded rules, or by analyzing system call logs of OS utility programs. Our observation shows that such system call traces can only subsume common usage scenarios of OS system calls, and likely omit hidden bugs.   In this research, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based solution, called RLTrace, to synthesize diverse and comprehensive system call traces as the seed to fuzz OS kernels. During model training, the deep learning model interacts with OS kernels and infers optimal system call traces w.r.t. our learning goal -- maximizing kernel code coverage. Our evaluation shows that RLTrace outperforms other seed generators by producing more comprehensive system call traces, subsuming system call corner usage cases and subtle dependencies. By feeding the de facto OS fuzzer, SYZKALLER, with system call traces synthesized by RLTrace, we show that SYZKALLER can achieve higher code coverage for testing Linux kernels. Furthermore, RLTrace found one vulnerability in the Linux kernel (version 5.5-rc6), which is publicly unknown to the best of our knowledge by the time of writing.

> The digitalization of the reproductive body has engaged myriads of cutting-edge technologies in supporting people to know and tackle their intimate health. Generally understood as female technologies (aka female-oriented technologies or 'FemTech'), these products and systems collect a wide range of intimate data which are processed, transferred, saved and shared with other parties. In this paper, we explore how the "data-hungry" nature of this industry and the lack of proper safeguarding mechanisms, standards, and regulations for vulnerable data can lead to complex harms or faint agentic potential. We adopted mixed methods in exploring users' understanding of the security and privacy (SP) of these technologies. Our findings show that while users can speculate the range of harms and risks associated with these technologies, they are not equipped and provided with the technological skills to protect themselves against such risks. We discuss a number of approaches, including participatory threat modelling and SP by design, in the context of this work and conclude that such approaches are critical to protect users in these sensitive systems.

> Forking attacks against TEEs like Intel SGX can be carried out either by rolling back the application to a previous state, or by cloning the application and by partitioning its inputs across the cloned instances. Current solutions to forking attacks require Trusted Third Parties (TTP) that are hard to find in real-world deployments. In the absence of a TTP, many TEE applications rely on monotonic counters to mitigate forking attacks based on rollbacks; however, they have no protection mechanism against forking attack based on cloning. In this paper, we analyze 72 SGX applications and show that approximately 20% of those are vulnerable to forking attacks based on cloning - including those that rely on monotonic counters. To address this problem, we present CloneBuster, the first practical clone-detection mechanism for Intel SGX that does not rely on a TTP and, as such, can be used directly to protect existing applications. CloneBuster allows enclaves to (self-) detect whether another enclave with the same binary is running on the same platform. To do so, CloneBuster relies on a cache-based covert channel for enclaves to signal their presence to (and detect the presence of) clones on the same machine. We show that CloneBuster is robust despite a malicious OS, only incurs a marginal impact on the application performance, and adds approximately 800 LoC to the TCB. When used in conjunction with monotonic counters, CloneBuster allows applications to benefit from a comprehensive protection against forking attacks.

> Identifying, analyzing, and evaluating cybersecurity risks are essential to assess the vulnerabilities of modern manufacturing infrastructures and to devise effective decision-making strategies to secure critical manufacturing against potential cyberattacks. In response, this work proposes a graph-theoretic approach for risk modeling and assessment to address the lack of quantitative cybersecurity risk assessment frameworks for smart manufacturing systems. In doing so, first, threat attributes are represented using an attack graphical model derived from manufacturing cyberattack taxonomies. Attack taxonomies offer consistent structures to categorize threat attributes, and the graphical approach helps model their interdependence. Second, the graphs are analyzed to explore how threat events can propagate through the manufacturing value chain and identify the manufacturing assets that threat actors can access and compromise during a threat event. Third, the proposed method identifies the attack path that maximizes the likelihood of success and minimizes the attack detection probability, and then computes the associated cybersecurity risk. Finally, the proposed risk modeling and assessment framework is demonstrated via an interconnected smart manufacturing system illustrative example. Using the proposed approach, practitioners can identify critical connections and manufacturing assets requiring prioritized security controls and develop and deploy appropriate defense measures accordingly.

> Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet. DNS resolvers, which act as the cache between DNS clients and DNS nameservers, are the central piece of the DNS infrastructure, essential to the scalability of DNS. However, finding the resolver vulnerabilities is non-trivial, and this problem is not well addressed by the existing tools. To list a few reasons, first, most of the known resolver vulnerabilities are non-crash bugs that cannot be directly detected by the existing oracles (or sanitizers). Second, there lacks rigorous specifications to be used as references to classify a test case as a resolver bug. Third, DNS resolvers are stateful, and stateful fuzzing is still challenging due to the large input space.   In this paper, we present a new fuzzing system termed ResolverFuzz to address the aforementioned challenges related to DNS resolvers, with a suite of new techniques being developed. First, ResolverFuzz performs constrained stateful fuzzing by focusing on the short query-response sequence, which has been demonstrated as the most effective way to find resolver bugs, based on our study of the published DNS CVEs. Second, to generate test cases that are more likely to trigger resolver bugs, we combine probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) based input generation with byte-level mutation for both queries and responses. Third, we leverage differential testing and clustering to identify non-crash bugs like cache poisoning bugs. We evaluated ResolverFuzz against 6 mainstream DNS software under 4 resolver modes. Overall, we identify 23 vulnerabilities that can result in cache poisoning, resource consumption, and crash attacks. After responsible disclosure, 19 of them have been confirmed or fixed, and 15 CVE numbers have been assigned.

> Measures of power grid vulnerability are often assessed by the amount of damage an adversary can exact on the network. However, the cascading impact of such attacks is often overlooked, even though cascades are one of the primary causes of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of transmission line protection settings as candidates for adversarial attacks, which can remain undetectable as long as the network equilibrium state remains unaltered. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian optimization procedure, where the objective is to find protection settings that maximize network degradation due to cascading. Notably, our proposed method is agnostic to the choice of the cascade simulator and its underlying assumptions. Numerical experiments reveal that, against conventional wisdom, maximally misconfiguring the protection settings of all network lines does not cause the most cascading. More surprisingly, even when the degree of misconfiguration is limited due to resource constraints, it is still possible to find settings that produce cascades comparable in severity to instances where there are no resource constraints.

> Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a popular unsupervised graph representation learning method. However, it has been shown that GCL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks on both the graph structure and node attributes. Although empirical approaches have been proposed to enhance the robustness of GCL, the certifiable robustness of GCL is still remain unexplored. In this paper, we develop the first certifiably robust framework in GCL. Specifically, we first propose a unified criteria to evaluate and certify the robustness of GCL. We then introduce a novel technique, RES (Randomized Edgedrop Smoothing), to ensure certifiable robustness for any GCL model, and this certified robustness can be provably preserved in downstream tasks. Furthermore, an effective training method is proposed for robust GCL. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in providing effective certifiable robustness and enhancing the robustness of any GCL model. The source code of RES is available at https://github.com/ventr1c/RES-GCL.

> In an era dominated by digital interactions, phishing campaigns have evolved to exploit not just technological vulnerabilities but also human traits. This study takes an unprecedented deep dive into large-scale phishing campaigns aimed at Meta's users, offering a dual perspective on the technical mechanics and human elements involved. Analysing data from over 25,000 victims worldwide, we highlight the nuances of these campaigns, from the intricate techniques deployed by the attackers to the sentiments and behaviours of those who were targeted. Unlike prior research conducted in controlled environments, this investigation capitalises on the vast, diverse, and genuine data extracted directly from active phishing campaigns, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the drivers, facilitators, and human factors. Through the application of advanced computational techniques, including natural language processing and machine learning, this work unveils critical insights into the psyche of victims and the evolving tactics of modern phishers. Our analysis illustrates very poor password selection choices from the victims but also persistence in the revictimisation of a significant part of the users. Finally, we reveal many correlations regarding demographics, timing, sentiment, emotion, and tone of the victims' responses.

> The way users acquire information is undergoing a paradigm shift with the advent of ChatGPT. Unlike conventional search engines, ChatGPT retrieves knowledge from the model itself and generates answers for users. ChatGPT's impressive question-answering (QA) capability has attracted more than 100 million users within a short period of time but has also raised concerns regarding its reliability. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale measurement of ChatGPT's reliability in the generic QA scenario with a carefully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets and eight domains. We find that ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains, especially underperforming in law and science questions. We also demonstrate that system roles, originally designed by OpenAI to allow users to steer ChatGPT's behavior, can impact ChatGPT's reliability in an imperceptible way. We further show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and even a single character change can negatively affect its reliability in certain cases. We believe that our study provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's reliability and underscores the need for strengthening the reliability and security of large language models (LLMs).

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been the driving force behind many of the recent advances in machine learning. However, research has shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples -- input samples that have been perturbed to force DNN-based models to make errors. As a result, Adversarial Machine Learning (AdvML) has gained a lot of attention, and researchers have investigated these vulnerabilities in various settings and modalities. In addition, DNNs have also been found to incorporate embedded bias and often produce unexplainable predictions, which can result in anti-social AI applications. The emergence of new AI technologies that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, increases the risk of producing anti-social applications at scale. AdvML for Social Good (AdvML4G) is an emerging field that repurposes the AdvML bug to invent pro-social applications. Regulators, practitioners, and researchers should collaborate to encourage the development of pro-social applications and hinder the development of anti-social ones. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive review of the emerging field of AdvML4G. This paper encompasses a taxonomy that highlights the emergence of AdvML4G, a discussion of the differences and similarities between AdvML4G and AdvML, a taxonomy covering social good-related concepts and aspects, an exploration of the motivations behind the emergence of AdvML4G at the intersection of ML4G and AdvML, and an extensive summary of the works that utilize AdvML4G as an auxiliary tool for innovating pro-social applications.

> In this paper, a new approach called HDNA (HTML DNA) is introduced for analyzing and comparing Document Object Model (DOM) trees in order to detect differences in HTML pages. This method assigns an identifier to each HTML page based on its structure, which proves to be particularly useful for detecting variations caused by server-side updates, user interactions or potential security risks. The process involves preprocessing the HTML content generating a DOM tree and calculating the disparities between two or more trees. By assigning weights to the nodes valuable insights about their hierarchical importance are obtained. The effectiveness of the HDNA approach has been demonstrated in identifying changes in DOM trees even when dynamically generated content is involved. Not does this method benefit web developers, testers, and security analysts by offering a deeper understanding of how web pages evolve. It also helps ensure the functionality and performance of web applications. Additionally, it enables detection and response to vulnerabilities that may arise from modifications in DOM structures. As the web ecosystem continues to evolve HDNA proves to be a tool, for individuals engaged in web development, testing, or security analysis.

> The global semiconductor supply chain involves design and fabrication at various locations, which leads to multiple security vulnerabilities, e.g., Hardware Trojan (HT) insertion. Although most HTs target digital circuits, HTs can be inserted in analog circuits. Therefore, several techniques have been developed for HT insertions in analog circuits. Capacitance-based Analog Hardware Trojan (AHT) is one of the stealthiest HT that can bypass most existing HT detection techniques because it uses negligible charge accumulation in the capacitor to generate stealthy triggers. To address the charge sharing and accumulation issues, we propose a novel way to detect such capacitance-based AHT in this paper. Secondly, we critically analyzed existing AHTs to highlight their respective limitations. We proposed a stealthier capacitor-based AHT (fortified AHT) that can bypass our novel AHT detection technique by addressing these limitations. Finally, by critically analyzing the proposed fortified AHT and existing AHTs, we developed a robust two-phase framework (DeMiST) in which a synchronous system can mitigate the effects of capacitance-based stealthy AHTs by turning off the triggering capability of AHT. In the first phase, we demonstrate how the synchronous system can avoid the AHT during run-time by controlling the supply voltage of the intermediate combinational circuits. In the second phase, we proposed a supply voltage duty cycle-based validation technique to detect capacitance-based AHTs. Furthermore, DeMiST amplified the switching activity for charge accumulation to such a degree that it can be easily detectable using existing switching activity-based HT detection techniques.

> Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train shared machine learning (ML) models without exposing clients' data privacy. It has gained substantial popularity in recent years, especially since the enforcement of data protection laws and regulations in many countries. To foster the application of FL, a variety of FL frameworks have been proposed, allowing non-experts to easily train ML models. As a result, understanding bugs in FL frameworks is critical for facilitating the development of better FL frameworks and potentially encouraging the development of bug detection, localization and repair tools. Thus, we conduct the first empirical study to comprehensively collect, taxonomize, and characterize bugs in FL frameworks. Specifically, we manually collect and classify 1,119 bugs from all the 676 closed issues and 514 merged pull requests in 17 popular and representative open-source FL frameworks on GitHub. We propose a classification of those bugs into 12 bug symptoms, 12 root causes, and 18 fix patterns. We also study their correlations and distributions on 23 functionalities. We identify nine major findings from our study, discuss their implications and future research directions based on our findings.

> Auto-completing code enables developers to speed up coding significantly. Recent advances in transformer-based large language model (LLM) technologies have been applied to code synthesis. However, studies show that many of such synthesized codes contain vulnerabilities. We propose a novel vulnerability-constrained decoding approach to reduce the amount of vulnerable code generated by such models. Using a small dataset of labeled vulnerable lines of code, we fine-tune an LLM to include vulnerability labels when generating code, acting as an embedded classifier. Then, during decoding, we deny the model to generate these labels to avoid generating vulnerable code. To evaluate the method, we chose to automatically complete Ethereum Blockchain smart contracts (SCs) as the case study due to the strict requirements of SC security. We first fine-tuned the 6-billion-parameter GPT-J model using 186,397 Ethereum SCs after removing the duplication from 2,217,692 SCs. The fine-tuning took more than one week using ten GPUs. The results showed that our fine-tuned model could synthesize SCs with an average BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score of 0.557. However, many codes in the auto-completed SCs were vulnerable. Using the code before the vulnerable line of 176 SCs containing different types of vulnerabilities to auto-complete the code, we found that more than 70% of the auto-completed codes were insecure. Thus, we further fine-tuned the model on other 941 vulnerable SCs containing the same types of vulnerabilities and applied vulnerability-constrained decoding. The fine-tuning took only one hour with four GPUs. We then auto-completed the 176 SCs again and found that our approach could identify 62% of the code to be generated as vulnerable and avoid generating 67% of them, indicating the approach could efficiently and effectively avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-completed code.

> Since the initial discovery of Meltdown and Spectre in 2017, different variants of these attacks have been discovered. One often overlooked variant is Meltdown 3a, also known as Meltdown-CPL-REG. Even though Meltdown-CPL-REG was initially discovered in 2018, the available information regarding the vulnerability is still sparse. In this paper, we analyze Meltdown-CPL-REG on 19 different CPUs from different vendors using an automated tool. We observe that the impact is more diverse than documented and differs from CPU to CPU. Surprisingly, while the newest Intel CPUs do not seem affected by Meltdown-CPL-REG, the newest available AMD CPUs (Zen3+) are still affected by the vulnerability. Furthermore, given our attack primitive CounterLeak, we show that besides up-to-date patches, Meltdown-CPL-REG can still be exploited as we reenable performance-counter-based attacks on cryptographic algorithms, break KASLR, and mount Spectre attacks. Although Meltdown-CPL-REG is not as powerful as other transient-execution attacks, its attack surface should not be underestimated.

> Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that gained popularity for enabling the transformation of cryptocurrency among peers without mediation by a centralized third-party authority. Smart contracts expand the applications of blockchain technology and have played a role in its widespread adoption. Smart contracts are immutable digital programs that are deployed on blockchains to codify agreements between parties. Existing smart contract implementations have faced challenges, including security vulnerabilities, leading to significant losses and concerns. This has stimulated a wave of attempts to improve Smart Contract Languages (SCLs) to overcome implementation challenges and ensure code quality, producing many languages with diverse features. Scholars have made some attempts to classify SCLs and clarify the process of selecting an SCL, but to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive survey of existing SCLs has been published. Our work surpasses earlier efforts by evaluating a significantly larger set of SCLs, in greater depth, to ease the process of SCL selection for blockchain research and implementation. In this paper, we (1) propose a robust framework for comparing existing SCLs, (2) analyze and discuss 36 SCLs, addressing issues beyond those used to construct the comparison framework, and (3) define new parameters for future research and development of SCLs. The survey provides a guide for those who intend to select or use an SCL to implement smart contracts, develop new SCLs, or add new extensions to the existing SCLs.

> In software development, it is common for programmers to copy-paste or port code snippets and then adapt them to their use case. This scenario motivates the code adaptation task -- a variant of program repair which aims to adapt variable identifiers in a pasted snippet of code to the surrounding, preexisting source code. However, no existing approach has been shown to effectively address this task. In this paper, we introduce AdaptivePaste, a learning-based approach to source code adaptation, based on transformers and a dedicated dataflow-aware deobfuscation pre-training task to learn meaningful representations of variable usage patterns. We evaluate AdaptivePaste on a dataset of code snippets in Python. Results suggest that our model can learn to adapt source code with 79.8% accuracy. To evaluate how valuable is AdaptivePaste in practice, we perform a user study with 10 Python developers on a hundred real-world copy-paste instances. The results show that AdaptivePaste reduces the dwell time to nearly half the time it takes for manual code adaptation, and helps to avoid bugs. In addition, we utilize the participant feedback to identify potential avenues for improvement of AdaptivePaste.

> Cooperation is challenging in biological systems, human societies, and multi-agent systems in general. While a group can benefit when everyone cooperates, it is tempting for each agent to act selfishly instead. Prior human studies show that people can overcome such social dilemmas while choosing interaction partners, i.e., strategic network rewiring. However, little is known about how agents, including humans, can learn about cooperation from strategic rewiring and vice versa. Here, we perform multi-agent reinforcement learning simulations in which two agents play the Prisoner's Dilemma game iteratively. Each agent has two policies: one controls whether to cooperate or defect; the other controls whether to rewire connections with another agent. This setting enables us to disentangle complex causal dynamics between cooperation and network rewiring. We find that network rewiring facilitates mutual cooperation even when one agent always offers cooperation, which is vulnerable to free-riding. We then confirm that the network-rewiring effect is exerted through agents' learning of ostracism, that is, connecting to cooperators and disconnecting from defectors. However, we also find that ostracism alone is not sufficient to make cooperation emerge. Instead, ostracism emerges from the learning of cooperation, and existing cooperation is subsequently reinforced due to the presence of ostracism. Our findings provide insights into the conditions and mechanisms necessary for the emergence of cooperation with network rewiring.

> Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a key component in securing the computer network from various cyber security threats and network attacks. However, consider an unfortunate situation where the NIDS is itself attacked and vulnerable more specifically, we can say, How to defend the defender?. In Adversarial Machine Learning (AML), the malicious actors aim to fool the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to produce incorrect predictions with intentionally crafted adversarial examples. These adversarial perturbed examples have become the biggest vulnerability of ML and DL based systems and are major obstacles to their adoption in real-time and mission-critical applications such as NIDS. AML is an emerging research domain, and it has become a necessity for the in-depth study of adversarial attacks and their defence strategies to safeguard the computer network from various cyber security threads. In this research work, we aim to cover important aspects related to NIDS, adversarial attacks and its defence mechanism to increase the robustness of the ML and DL based NIDS. We implemented four powerful adversarial attack techniques, namely, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Carlini & Wagner (C&W) in NIDS. We analyzed its performance in terms of various performance metrics in detail. Furthermore, the three heuristics defence strategies, i.e., Adversarial Training (AT), Gaussian Data Augmentation (GDA) and High Confidence (HC), are implemented to improve the NIDS robustness under adversarial attack situations. The complete workflow is demonstrated in real-time network with data packet flow. This research work provides the overall background for the researchers interested in AML and its implementation from a computer network security point of view.

- *Xuran Li, Peng Wu, Kaixiang Dong, Zhen Zhang, Yanting Chen*

- `2305.10906v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10906v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10906v2)

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) often face challenges due to their vulnerability to various adversarial perturbations, including false perturbations that undermine prediction accuracy and biased perturbations that cause biased predictions for similar inputs. This paper introduces a novel approach, RobustFair, to evaluate the accurate fairness of DNNs when subjected to these false or biased perturbations. RobustFair employs the notion of the fairness confusion matrix induced in accurate fairness to identify the crucial input features for perturbations. This matrix categorizes predictions as true fair, true biased, false fair, and false biased, and the perturbations guided by it can produce a dual impact on instances and their similar counterparts to either undermine prediction accuracy (robustness) or cause biased predictions (individual fairness). RobustFair then infers the ground truth of these generated adversarial instances based on their loss function values approximated by the total derivative. To leverage the generated instances for trustworthiness improvement, RobustFair further proposes a data augmentation strategy to prioritize adversarial instances resembling the original training set, for data augmentation and model retraining. Notably, RobustFair excels at detecting intertwined issues of robustness and individual fairness, which are frequently overlooked in standard robustness and individual fairness evaluations. This capability empowers RobustFair to enhance both robustness and individual fairness evaluations by concurrently identifying defects in either domain. Empirical case studies and quantile regression analyses on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the fairness confusion matrix guided perturbation for false or biased adversarial instance generation.

- `2305.06018v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06018v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06018v2)

> Ensuring the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) is imperative. One of the crucial methods towards this assurance is the meticulous construction and execution of test scenarios, a task often regarded as tedious and laborious. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces TARGET, an end-to-end framework designed for the automatic generation of test scenarios grounded in established traffic rules. Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) with concise and expressive syntax for scenario descriptions. To handle the natural language complexity and ambiguity in traffic rule descriptions, we leverage a large language model to automatically extract knowledge from traffic rules and convert the traffic rule descriptions to DSL representations. Based on these representations, TARGET synthesizes executable test scenario scripts to render the testing scenarios in a simulator. Comprehensive evaluations of the framework were conducted on four distinct ADSs, yielding a total of 217 test scenarios spread across eight diverse maps. These scenarios identify approximately 700 rule violations, collisions, and other significant issues, including navigation failures. Moreover, for each detected anomaly, TARGET provides detailed scenario recordings and log reports, significantly easing the process of troubleshooting and root cause analysis. Two of these causes have been confirmed by the ADS developers; one is corroborated by an existing bug report from the ADS, and the other one is attributed to the limited functionality of the ADS.

> Large language models (LLMs) have shown nearly saturated performance on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As a result, it is natural for people to believe that LLMs have also mastered abilities such as time understanding and reasoning. However, research on the temporal sensitivity of LLMs has been insufficiently emphasized. To fill this gap, this paper constructs Multiple Sensitive Factors Time QA (MenatQA), which encompasses three temporal factors (scope factor, order factor, counterfactual factor) with total 2,853 samples for evaluating the time comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper tests current mainstream LLMs with different parameter sizes, ranging from billions to hundreds of billions. The results show most LLMs fall behind smaller temporal reasoning models with different degree on these factors. In specific, LLMs show a significant vulnerability to temporal biases and depend heavily on the temporal information provided in questions. Furthermore, this paper undertakes a preliminary investigation into potential improvement strategies by devising specific prompts and leveraging external tools. These approaches serve as valuable baselines or references for future research endeavors.

> In this work, we explore the applicability of cache occupancy attacks and the implications of secured cache design rationales on such attacks. In particular, we show that one of the well-known cache randomization schemes, MIRAGE, touted to be resilient against eviction-based attacks, amplifies the chances of cache occupancy attack, making it more vulnerable compared to contemporary designs. We leverage MIRAGE's global eviction property to demonstrate covert channel with byte-level granularity, with far less cache occupancy requirement (just $10\%$ of LLC) than other schemes. For instance, ScatterCache (a randomisation scheme with lesser security guarantees than MIRAGE) and generic set-associative caches require $40\%$ and $30\%$ cache occupancy, respectively, to exhibit covert communication. Furthermore, we extend our attack vectors to include side-channel, template-based fingerprinting of workloads in a cross-core setting. We demonstrate the potency of such fingerprinting on both inhouse LLC simulator as well as on SPEC2017 workloads on gem5. Finally, we pinpoint implementation inconsistencies in MIRAGE's publicly available gem5 artifact which motivates a re-evaluation of the performance statistics of MIRAGE with respect to ScatterCache and baseline set-associative cache. We find MIRAGE, in reality, performs worse than what is previously reported in literature, a concern that should be addressed in successor generations of secured caches.

> Recent continual learning approaches have primarily focused on mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Nevertheless, two critical areas have remained relatively unexplored: 1) evaluating the robustness of proposed methods and 2) ensuring the security of learned tasks. This paper investigates the susceptibility of continually learned tasks, including current and previously acquired tasks, to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we have observed that any class belonging to any task can be easily targeted and misclassified as the desired target class of any other task. Such susceptibility or vulnerability of learned tasks to adversarial attacks raises profound concerns regarding data integrity and privacy. To assess the robustness of continual learning approaches, we consider continual learning approaches in all three scenarios, i.e., task-incremental learning, domain-incremental learning, and class-incremental learning. In this regard, we explore the robustness of three regularization-based methods, three replay-based approaches, and one hybrid technique that combines replay and exemplar approaches. We empirically demonstrated that in any setting of continual learning, any class, whether belonging to the current or previously learned tasks, is susceptible to misclassification. Our observations identify potential limitations of continual learning approaches against adversarial attacks and highlight that current continual learning algorithms could not be suitable for deployment in real-world settings.

- `2305.18355v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18355v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18355v2)

> Recently, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating tasks, including image and audio generation. However, like other generative models, diffusion models are prone to privacy issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient query-based membership inference attack (MIA), namely Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), which utilizes groundtruth trajectory obtained by $\epsilon$ initialized in $t=0$ and predicted point to infer memberships. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance with only two queries on both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion models. Moreover, previous works on the privacy of diffusion models have focused on vision tasks without considering audio tasks. Therefore, we also explore the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the text-to-speech (TTS) task, which is an audio generation task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the TTS task. Experimental results indicate that models with mel-spectrogram (image-like) output are vulnerable to MIA, while models with audio output are relatively robust to MIA. {Code is available at \url{https://github.com/kong13661/PIA}}.

> Human trafficking (HT) is a pervasive global issue affecting vulnerable individuals, violating their fundamental human rights. Investigations reveal that a significant number of HT cases are associated with online advertisements (ads), particularly in escort markets. Consequently, identifying and connecting HT vendors has become increasingly challenging for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). To address this issue, we introduce IDTraffickers, an extensive dataset consisting of 87,595 text ads and 5,244 vendor labels to enable the verification and identification of potential HT vendors on online escort markets. To establish a benchmark for authorship identification, we train a DeCLUTR-small model, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.8656 in a closed-set classification environment. Next, we leverage the style representations extracted from the trained classifier to conduct authorship verification, resulting in a mean r-precision score of 0.8852 in an open-set ranking environment. Finally, to encourage further research and ensure responsible data sharing, we plan to release IDTraffickers for the authorship attribution task to researchers under specific conditions, considering the sensitive nature of the data. We believe that the availability of our dataset and benchmarks will empower future researchers to utilize our findings, thereby facilitating the effective linkage of escort ads and the development of more robust approaches for identifying HT indicators.

> In the ever-evolving realm of cybersecurity, the rise of generative AI models like ChatGPT, FraudGPT, and WormGPT has introduced both innovative solutions and unprecedented challenges. This research delves into the multifaceted applications of generative AI in social engineering attacks, offering insights into the evolving threat landscape using the blog mining technique. Generative AI models have revolutionized the field of cyberattacks, empowering malicious actors to craft convincing and personalized phishing lures, manipulate public opinion through deepfakes, and exploit human cognitive biases. These models, ChatGPT, FraudGPT, and WormGPT, have augmented existing threats and ushered in new dimensions of risk. From phishing campaigns that mimic trusted organizations to deepfake technology impersonating authoritative figures, we explore how generative AI amplifies the arsenal of cybercriminals. Furthermore, we shed light on the vulnerabilities that AI-driven social engineering exploits, including psychological manipulation, targeted phishing, and the crisis of authenticity. To counter these threats, we outline a range of strategies, including traditional security measures, AI-powered security solutions, and collaborative approaches in cybersecurity. We emphasize the importance of staying vigilant, fostering awareness, and strengthening regulations in the battle against AI-enhanced social engineering attacks. In an environment characterized by the rapid evolution of AI models and a lack of training data, defending against generative AI threats requires constant adaptation and the collective efforts of individuals, organizations, and governments. This research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between generative AI and social engineering attacks, equipping stakeholders with the knowledge to navigate this intricate cybersecurity landscape.

> Mobile devices often distribute measurements from physical sensors to multiple applications using software multiplexing. On Android devices, the highest requested sampling frequency is returned to all applications, even if others request measurements at lower frequencies. In this paper, we comprehensively demonstrate that this design choice exposes practically exploitable side-channels using frequency-key shifting. By carefully modulating sensor sampling frequencies in software, we show how unprivileged malicious applications can construct reliable spectral covert channels that bypass existing security mechanisms. Additionally, we present a novel variant that allows an unprivileged malicious application to profile other active, sensor-enabled applications at a coarse-grained level. Both methods do not impose any special assumptions beyond accessing standard mobile services available to developers. As such, our work reports side-channel vulnerabilities that exploit subtle yet insecure design choices in Android sensor stacks.

> The development of automated vehicles has the potential to revolutionize transportation, but they are currently unable to ensure a safe and time-efficient driving style. Reliable models predicting human behavior are essential for overcoming this issue. While data-driven models are commonly used to this end, they can be vulnerable in safety-critical edge cases. This has led to an interest in models incorporating cognitive theory, but as such models are commonly developed for explanatory purposes, this approach's effectiveness in behavior prediction has remained largely untested so far. In this article, we investigate the usefulness of the \emph{Commotions} model -- a novel cognitively plausible model incorporating the latest theories of human perception, decision-making, and motor control -- for predicting human behavior in gap acceptance scenarios, which entail many important traffic interactions such as lane changes and intersections. We show that this model can compete with or even outperform well-established data-driven prediction models across several naturalistic datasets. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating cognitive theory in behavior prediction models for automated vehicles.

> Online marketplaces execute large volume of price updates that are initiated by individual marketplace sellers each day on the platform. This price democratization comes with increasing challenges with data quality. Lack of centralized guardrails that are available for a traditional online retailer causes a higher likelihood for inaccurate prices to get published on the website, leading to poor customer experience and potential for revenue loss. We present MoatPlus (Masked Optimal Anchors using Trees, Proximity-based Labeling and Unsupervised Statistical-features), a scalable price anomaly detection framework for a growing marketplace platform. The goal is to leverage proximity and historical price trends from unsupervised statistical features to generate an upper price bound. We build an ensemble of models to detect irregularities in price-based features, exclude irregular features and use optimized weighting scheme to build a reliable price bound in real-time pricing pipeline. We observed that our approach improves precise anchor coverage by up to 46.6% in high-vulnerability item subsets

> Modern software heavily relies on the use of components. Those components are usually published in central repositories, and managed by build systems via dependencies. Due to issues around vulnerabilities, licenses and the propagation of bugs, the study of those dependencies is of utmost importance, and numerous software composition analysis tools have emerged for this purpose. A particular challenge are hidden dependencies that are the result of cloning or shading where code from a component is "inlined", and, in the case of shading, moved to different namespaces.   We present a novel approach to detect vulnerable clones in the Maven repository. Our approach is lightweight in that it does not require the creation and maintenance of a custom index. Starting with 29 vulnerabilities with assigned CVEs and proof-of-vulnerability projects, we retrieve over 53k potential vulnerable clones from Maven Central. After running our analysis on this set, we detect 727 confirmed vulnerable clones (86 if versions are aggregated) and synthesize a testable proof-of-vulnerability project for each of those. We demonstrate that existing SCA tools often miss those exposures. At the time of submission those results have led to changes to the entries for six CVEs in the GitHub Security Advisory Database (GHSA) via accepted pull requests, with more pending.

This paper aims to evaluate the vulnerabilities of federated learning networks in medical image analysis against such attacks. Employing domain-specific MRI tumor and pathology imaging datasets, we assess the effectiveness of known threat scenarios in a federated learning environment. Our tests reveal that domain-specific configurations can increase the attacker's success rate significantly. The findings emphasize the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms and suggest a critical re-evaluation of current security protocols in federated medical image analysis systems.

> Power side-channel attacks exploit the dynamic power consumption of cryptographic operations to leak sensitive information of encryption hardware. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct power side-channel analysis for assessing the susceptibility of cryptographic systems and mitigating potential risks. Existing power side-channel analysis primarily focuses on post-silicon implementations, which are inflexible in addressing design flaws, leading to costly and time-consuming post-fabrication design re-spins. Hence, pre-silicon power side-channel analysis is required for early detection of vulnerabilities to improve design robustness. In this paper, we introduce SCAR, a novel pre-silicon power side-channel analysis framework based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). SCAR converts register-transfer level (RTL) designs of encryption hardware into control-data flow graphs and use that to detect the design modules susceptible to side-channel leakage. Furthermore, we incorporate a deep learning-based explainer in SCAR to generate quantifiable and human-accessible explanation of our detection and localization decisions. We have also developed a fortification component as a part of SCAR that uses large-language models (LLM) to automatically generate and insert additional design code at the localized zone to shore up the side-channel leakage. When evaluated on popular encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, and PRESENT, and postquantum cryptography algorithms like Saber and CRYSTALS-Kyber, SCAR, achieves up to 94.49% localization accuracy, 100% precision, and 90.48% recall. Additionally, through explainability analysis, SCAR reduces features for GNN model training by 57% while maintaining comparable accuracy. We believe that SCAR will transform the security-critical hardware design cycle, resulting in faster design closure at a reduced design cost.

> Bugs are notoriously challenging: they slow down software users and result in time-consuming investigations for developers. These challenges are exacerbated when bugs must be reported in natural language by users. Indeed, we lack reliable tools to automatically address reported bugs (i.e., enabling their analysis, reproduction, and bug fixing). With the recent promises created by LLMs such as ChatGPT for various tasks, including in software engineering, we ask ourselves: What if ChatGPT could understand bug reports and reproduce them? This question will be the main focus of this study. To evaluate whether ChatGPT is capable of catching the semantics of bug reports, we used the popular Defects4J benchmark with its bug reports. Our study has shown that ChatGPT was able to demystify and reproduce 50% of the reported bugs. ChatGPT being able to automatically address half of the reported bugs shows promising potential in the direction of applying machine learning to address bugs with only a human-in-the-loop to report the bug.

> Software testing is a core discipline in software engineering where a large array of research results has been produced, notably in the area of automatic test generation. Because existing approaches produce test cases that either can be qualified as simple (e.g. unit tests) or that require precise specifications, most testing procedures still rely on test cases written by humans to form test suites. Such test suites, however, are incomplete: they only cover parts of the project or they are produced after the bug is fixed. Yet, several research challenges, such as automatic program repair, and practitioner processes, build on the assumption that available test suites are sufficient. There is thus a need to break existing barriers in automatic test case generation. While prior work largely focused on random unit testing inputs, we propose to consider generating test cases that realistically represent complex user execution scenarios, which reveal buggy behaviour. Such scenarios are informally described in bug reports, which should therefore be considered as natural inputs for specifying bug-triggering test cases. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of performing this generation by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and using bug reports as inputs. Our experiments include the use of ChatGPT, as an online service, as well as CodeGPT, a code-related pre-trained LLM that was fine-tuned for our task. Overall, we experimentally show that bug reports associated to up to 50% of Defects4J bugs can prompt ChatGPT to generate an executable test case. We show that even new bug reports can indeed be used as input for generating executable test cases. Finally, we report experimental results which confirm that LLM-generated test cases are immediately useful in software engineering tasks such as fault localization as well as patch validation in automated program repair.

> Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performances in various domains, while they are vulnerable to the inputs with well-crafted but small perturbations, which are named after adversarial examples (AEs). Among many strategies to improve the model robustness against AEs, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) based adversarial training is one of the most effective methods. Unfortunately, the prohibitive computational overhead of generating strong enough AEs, due to the maximization of the loss function, sometimes makes the regular PGD adversarial training impractical when using larger and more complicated models. In this paper, we propose that the adversarial loss can be approximated by the partial sum of Taylor series. Furthermore, we approximate the gradient of adversarial loss and propose a new and efficient adversarial training method, adversarial training with gradient approximation (GAAT), to reduce the cost of building up robust models. Additionally, extensive experiments demonstrate that this efficiency improvement can be achieved without any or with very little loss in accuracy on natural and adversarial examples, which show that our proposed method saves up to 60\% of the training time with comparable model test accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

> EdDSA is a standardised elliptic curve digital signature scheme introduced to overcome some of the issues prevalent in the more established ECDSA standard. Due to the EdDSA standard specifying that the EdDSA signature be deterministic, if the signing function were to be used as a public key signing oracle for the attacker, the unforgeability notion of security of the scheme can be broken. This paper describes an attack against some of the most popular EdDSA implementations, which results in an adversary recovering the private key used during signing. With this recovered secret key, an adversary can sign arbitrary messages that would be seen as valid by the EdDSA verification function. A list of libraries with vulnerable APIs at the time of publication is provided. Furthermore, this paper provides two suggestions for securing EdDSA signing APIs against this vulnerability while it additionally discusses failed attempts to solve the issue.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, including those that affect both node features and graph topology. This paper investigates GNNs derived from diverse neural flows, concentrating on their connection to various stability notions such as BIBO stability, Lyapunov stability, structural stability, and conservative stability. We argue that Lyapunov stability, despite its common use, does not necessarily ensure adversarial robustness. Inspired by physics principles, we advocate for the use of conservative Hamiltonian neural flows to construct GNNs that are robust to adversarial attacks. The adversarial robustness of different neural flow GNNs is empirically compared on several benchmark datasets under a variety of adversarial attacks. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that GNNs leveraging conservative Hamiltonian flows with Lyapunov stability substantially improve robustness against adversarial perturbations. The implementation code of experiments is available at https://github.com/zknus/NeurIPS-2023-HANG-Robustness.

> In the existing software development ecosystem, security issues introduced by third-party code cannot be overlooked. Among these security concerns, memory access vulnerabilities stand out prominently, leading to risks such as the theft or tampering of sensitive data. To address this issue, software-based defense mechanisms have been established at the programming language, compiler, and operating system levels. However, as a trade-off, these mechanisms significantly reduce software execution efficiency. Hardware-software co-design approaches have sought to either construct entirely isolated trusted execution environments or attempt to partition security domains within the same address space. While such approaches enhance efficiency compared to pure software methods, they also encounter challenges related to granularity of protection, performance overhead, and portability. In response to these challenges, we present the DASICS (Dynamic in-Address-Space Isolation by Code Segments) secure processor design, which offers dynamic and flexible security protection across multiple privilege levels, addressing data flow protection, control flow protection, and secure system calls. We have implemented hardware FPGA prototypes and software QEMU simulator prototypes based on DASICS, along with necessary modifications to system software for adaptability. We illustrate the protective mechanisms and effectiveness of DASICS with two practical examples and provide potential real-world use cases where DASICS could be applied.

- `2310.04373v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04373v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04373v2)

> Large language models are typically aligned with human preferences by optimizing $\textit{reward models}$ (RMs) fitted to human feedback. However, human preferences are multi-faceted, and it is increasingly common to derive reward from a composition of simpler reward models which each capture a different aspect of language quality. This itself presents a challenge, as it is difficult to appropriately weight these component RMs when combining them. Compounding this difficulty, because any RM is only a proxy for human evaluation, this process is vulnerable to $\textit{overoptimization}$, wherein past a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse human ratings. In this paper, we perform, to our knowledge, the first study on overoptimization in composite RMs, showing that correlation between component RMs has a significant effect on the locations of these points. We then introduce an approach to solve this issue using constrained reinforcement learning as a means of preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's threshold of usefulness. Our method addresses the problem of weighting component RMs by learning dynamic weights, naturally expressed by Lagrange multipliers. As a result, each RM stays within the range at which it is an effective proxy, improving evaluation performance. Finally, we introduce an adaptive method using gradient-free optimization to identify and optimize towards these points during a single run.

- `2310.06703v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06703v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06703v1)

> Automatic crash bucketing is a crucial phase in the software development process for efficiently triaging bug reports. It generally consists in grouping similar reports through clustering techniques. However, with real-time streaming bug collection, systems are needed to quickly answer the question: What are the most similar bugs to a new one?, that is, efficiently find near-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search to tackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance and theoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly, LSH has not been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivial to derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive property for the most advanced crash bucketing metrics. Consequently, we study in this paper how to leverage LSH for this task. To be able to consider the most relevant metrics used in the literature, we introduce DeepLSH, a Siamese DNN architecture with an original loss function, that perfectly approximates the locality-sensitivity property even for Jaccard and Cosine metrics for which exact LSH solutions exist. We support this claim with a series of experiments on an original dataset, which we make available.

> In this work, we set out to conduct the first ground-truth empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art DL fuzzers. Specifically, we first manually created an extensive DL bug benchmark dataset, which includes 627 real-world DL bugs from TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries reported by users between 2020 and 2022. Then we run three state-of-the-art DL fuzzers, i.e., FreeFuzz, DeepRel, and DocTer, on the benchmark by following their instructions. We find that these fuzzers are unable to detect many real bugs collected in our benchmark dataset. Specifically, most (235) of the 257 applicable bugs cannot be detected by any fuzzer.   Our systematic analysis further identifies four major, broad, and common factors that affect these fuzzers' ability to detect real bugs. These findings present opportunities to improve the performance of the fuzzers in future work. As a proof of concept, we propose a lightweight corner case generator as an extension to the three DL fuzzers, which simply covers several boundary values as well as DL-specific data types. It helps FreeFuzz, DeepRel, and DocTer detect 12, 12, and 14 more bugs, respectively, that were overlooked by the original fuzzers. Overall, this work complements prior studies on DL fuzzers with an extensive performance evaluation and provides a benchmark for future DL library fuzzing studies. Also, our proposed corner case generator proves that the fuzzers can be extended to detect more bugs by extending their internal fuzzing logic based on the insights provided in root cause analysis.

> Often, the first step in managing bug reports is related to triaging a bug to the appropriate developer who is best suited to understand, localize, and fix the target bug. Additionally, assigning a given bug to a particular part of a software project can help to expedite the fixing process. However, despite the importance of these activities, they are quite challenging, where days can be spent on the manual triaging process. Past studies have attempted to leverage the limited textual data of bug reports to train text classification models that automate this process -- to varying degrees of success. However, the textual representations and machine learning models used in prior work are limited by their expressiveness, often failing to capture nuanced textual patterns that might otherwise aid in the triaging process. Recently, large, transformer-based, pre-trained neural text representation techniques such as BERT have achieved greater performance in several natural language processing tasks. However, the potential for using these techniques to improve upon prior approaches for automated bug triaging is not well studied or understood.   Therefore, in this paper we offer one of the first investigations that fine-tunes transformer-based language models for the task of bug triaging on four open source datasets, spanning a collective 53 years of development history with over 400 developers and over 150 software project components. Our study includes both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of effectiveness. Our findings illustrate that DeBERTa is the most effective technique across the triaging tasks of developer and component assignment, and the measured performance delta is statistically significant compared to other techniques. However, through our qualitative analysis, we also observe that each technique possesses unique abilities best suited to certain types of bug reports.

> In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about threats, generate information about tools, and automate cyber campaigns. We begin with a manual exploration of LLMs in supporting specific threat-related actions and decisions. We proceed by automating the decision process in a cyber campaign. We present prompt engineering approaches for a plan-act-report loop for one action of a threat campaign and and a prompt chaining design that directs the sequential decision process of a multi-action campaign. We assess the extent of LLM's cyber-specific knowledge w.r.t the short campaign we demonstrate and provide insights into prompt design for eliciting actionable responses. We discuss the potential impact of LLMs on the threat landscape and the ethical considerations of using LLMs for accelerating threat actor capabilities. We report a promising, yet concerning, application of generative AI to cyber threats. However, the LLM's capabilities to deal with more complex networks, sophisticated vulnerabilities, and the sensitivity of prompts are open questions. This research should spur deliberations over the inevitable advancements in LLM-supported cyber adversarial landscape.

> We introduce new jailbreak attacks on vision language models (VLMs), which use aligned LLMs and are resilient to text-only jailbreak attacks. Specifically, we develop cross-modality attacks on alignment where we pair adversarial images going through the vision encoder with textual prompts to break the alignment of the language model. Our attacks employ a novel compositional strategy that combines an image, adversarially targeted towards toxic embeddings, with generic prompts to accomplish the jailbreak. Thus, the LLM draws the context to answer the generic prompt from the adversarial image. The generation of benign-appearing adversarial images leverages a novel embedding-space-based methodology, operating with no access to the LLM model. Instead, the attacks require access only to the vision encoder and utilize one of our four embedding space targeting strategies. By not requiring access to the LLM, the attacks lower the entry barrier for attackers, particularly when vision encoders such as CLIP are embedded in closed-source LLMs. The attacks achieve a high success rate across different VLMs, highlighting the risk of cross-modality alignment vulnerabilities, and the need for new alignment approaches for multi-modal models.

- `2310.07152v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07152v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07152v1)

> On-device ML introduces new security challenges: DNN models become white-box accessible to device users. Based on white-box information, adversaries can conduct effective model stealing (MS) and membership inference attack (MIA). Using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to shield on-device DNN models aims to downgrade (easy) white-box attacks to (harder) black-box attacks. However, one major shortcoming is the sharply increased latency (up to 50X). To accelerate TEE-shield DNN computation with GPUs, researchers proposed several model partition techniques. These solutions, referred to as TEE-Shielded DNN Partition (TSDP), partition a DNN model into two parts, offloading the privacy-insensitive part to the GPU while shielding the privacy-sensitive part within the TEE. This paper benchmarks existing TSDP solutions using both MS and MIA across a variety of DNN models, datasets, and metrics. We show important findings that existing TSDP solutions are vulnerable to privacy-stealing attacks and are not as safe as commonly believed. We also unveil the inherent difficulty in deciding optimal DNN partition configurations (i.e., the highest security with minimal utility cost) for present TSDP solutions. The experiments show that such ``sweet spot'' configurations vary across datasets and models. Based on lessons harvested from the experiments, we present TEESlice, a novel TSDP method that defends against MS and MIA during DNN inference. TEESlice follows a partition-before-training strategy, which allows for accurate separation between privacy-related weights from public weights. TEESlice delivers the same security protection as shielding the entire DNN model inside TEE (the ``upper-bound'' security guarantees) with over 10X less overhead (in both experimental and real-world environments) than prior TSDP solutions and no accuracy loss.

> Vehicular crowd intelligence (VCI) is an emerging research field. Facilitated by state-of-the-art vehicular ad-hoc networks and artificial intelligence, various VCI applications come to place, e.g., collaborative sensing, positioning, and mapping. The collaborative property of VCI applications generally requires data to be shared among participants, thus forming network-wide intelligence. How to fulfill this process without compromising data privacy remains a challenging issue. Although federated learning (FL) is a promising tool to solve the problem, adapting conventional FL frameworks to VCI is nontrivial. First, the centralized model aggregation is unreliable in VCI because of the existence of stragglers with unfavorable channel conditions. Second, existing FL schemes are vulnerable to Non-IID data, which is intensified by the data heterogeneity in VCI. This paper proposes a novel federated learning framework called RaftFed to facilitate privacy-preserving VCI. The experimental results show that RaftFed performs better than baselines regarding communication overhead, model accuracy, and model convergence.

> In this paper, we consider that, in practice, attack scenarios involving side-channel analysis combine two successive phases:an analysis phase, targeting the extraction of information about the target and the identification of possible vulnerabilities;and an exploitation phase, applying attack techniques on candidate vulnerabilities. We advocate that protections need to coverthese two phases in order to be effective against real-life attacks. We present PolEn, a toolchain and a processor architecturethat combine countermeasures in order to provide an effective mitigation of side-channel attacks: as a countermeasure againstthe analysis phase, our approach considers the use of code encryption; as a countermeasure against the exploitation phase,our approach considers the use of code polymorphism, because it relies on runtime code generation, and its combinationwith code encryption is particularly challenging. Code encryption is supported by a processor extension such that machineinstructions are only decrypted inside the CPU, which effectively prevents reverse engineering or any extraction of usefulinformation from memory dumps. Code polymorphism is implemented by software means. It regularly changes the observablebehaviour of the program, making it unpredictable for an attacker, hence reducing the possibility to exploit side-channelleakages. We present a prototype implementation, based on the RISC-V Spike simulator and a modified LLVM toolchain. Inour experimental evaluation, we illustrate that PolEn effectively reduces side-channel leakages. For the protected functionsevaluated, static memory use increases by a factor of 5 to 22, corresponding to the joint application of code encryption andcode polymorphism. The overhead, in terms of execution time, ranges between a factor of 1.8 and 4.6.

> Healthcare is one of the foremost applications of machine learning (ML). Traditionally, ML models are trained by central servers, which aggregate data from various distributed devices to forecast the results for newly generated data. This is a major concern as models can access sensitive user information, which raises privacy concerns. A federated learning (FL) approach can help address this issue: A global model sends its copy to all clients who train these copies, and the clients send the updates (weights) back to it. Over time, the global model improves and becomes more accurate. Data privacy is protected during training, as it is conducted locally on the clients' devices.   However, the global model is susceptible to data poisoning. We develop a privacy-preserving FL technique for a skin cancer dataset and show that the model is prone to data poisoning attacks. Ten clients train the model, but one of them intentionally introduces flipped labels as an attack. This reduces the accuracy of the global model. As the percentage of label flipping increases, there is a noticeable decrease in accuracy. We use a stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm to find the most optimal accuracy for the model. Although FL can protect user privacy for healthcare diagnostics, it is also vulnerable to data poisoning, which must be addressed.

> This paper presents two computationally efficient algorithms for the orientation estimation of inertial measurement units (IMUs): the correntropy-based gradient descent (CGD) and the correntropy-based decoupled orientation estimation (CDOE). Traditional methods, such as gradient descent (GD) and decoupled orientation estimation (DOE), rely on the mean squared error (MSE) criterion, making them vulnerable to external acceleration and magnetic interference. To address this issue, we demonstrate that the multi-kernel correntropy loss (MKCL) is an optimal objective function for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) when the noise follows a type of heavy-tailed distribution. In certain situations, the estimation error of the MKCL is bounded even in the presence of arbitrarily large outliers. By replacing the standard MSE cost function with MKCL, we develop the CGD and CDOE algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods by comparing them with existing algorithms in various situations. Experimental results indicate that our proposed methods (CGD and CDOE) outperform their conventional counterparts (GD and DOE), especially when faced with external acceleration and magnetic disturbances. Furthermore, the new algorithms demonstrate significantly lower computational complexity than Kalman filter-based approaches, making them suitable for applications with low-cost microprocessors.

> Fine-tuning large pre-trained computer vision models is infeasible for resource-limited users. Visual prompt learning (VPL) has thus emerged to provide an efficient and flexible alternative to model fine-tuning through Visual Prompt as a Service (VPPTaaS). Specifically, the VPPTaaS provider optimizes a visual prompt given downstream data, and downstream users can use this prompt together with the large pre-trained model for prediction. However, this new learning paradigm may also pose security risks when the VPPTaaS provider instead provides a malicious visual prompt. In this paper, we take the first step to explore such risks through the lens of backdoor attacks. Specifically, we propose BadVisualPrompt, a simple yet effective backdoor attack against VPL. For example, poisoning $5\%$ CIFAR10 training data leads to above $99\%$ attack success rates with only negligible model accuracy drop by $1.5\%$. In particular, we identify and then address a new technical challenge related to interactions between the backdoor trigger and visual prompt, which does not exist in conventional, model-level backdoors. Moreover, we provide in-depth analyses of seven backdoor defenses from model, prompt, and input levels. Overall, all these defenses are either ineffective or impractical to mitigate our BadVisualPrompt, implying the critical vulnerability of VPL.

> In this paper, we present Hermes, an end-to-end framework to automatically generate formal representations from natural language cellular specifications. We first develop a neural constituency parser, NEUTREX, to process transition-relevant texts and extract transition components (i.e., states, conditions, and actions). We also design a domain-specific language to translate these transition components to logical formulas by leveraging dependency parse trees. Finally, we compile these logical formulas to generate transitions and create the formal model as finite state machines. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Hermes, we evaluate it on 4G NAS, 5G NAS, and 5G RRC specifications and obtain an overall accuracy of 81-87%, which is a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art. Our security analysis of the extracted models uncovers 3 new vulnerabilities and identifies 19 previous attacks in 4G and 5G specifications, and 7 deviations in commercial 4G basebands.

> Relying on dependency packages accelerates software development, but it also increases the exposure to security vulnerabilities that may be present in dependencies. While developers have full control over which dependency packages (and which version) they use, they have no control over the dependencies of their dependencies. Such transitive dependencies, which often amount to a greater number than direct dependencies, can become infected with vulnerabilities and put software projects at risk. To mitigate this risk, Practitioners need to select dependencies that respond quickly to vulnerabilities to prevent the propagation of vulnerable code to their project. To identify such dependencies, we analyze more than 450 vulnerabilities in the npm ecosystem to understand why dependent packages remain vulnerable. We identify over 200,000 npm packages that are infected through their dependencies and use 9 features to build a prediction model that identifies packages that quickly adopt the vulnerability fix and prevent further propagation of vulnerabilities. We also study the relationship between these features and the response speed of vulnerable packages. We complement our work with a practitioner survey to understand the applicability of our findings. Developers can incorporate our findings into their dependency management practices to mitigate the impact of vulnerabilities from their dependency supply chain.

> Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to identify specific data samples within the private training dataset of machine learning models, leading to serious privacy violations and other sophisticated threats. Many practical black-box MIAs require query access to the data distribution (the same distribution where the private data is drawn) to train shadow models. By doing so, the adversary obtains models trained "with" or "without" samples drawn from the distribution, and analyzes the characteristics of the samples under consideration. The adversary is often required to train more than hundreds of shadow models to extract the signals needed for MIAs; this becomes the computational overhead of MIAs. In this paper, we propose that by strategically choosing the samples, MI adversaries can maximize their attack success while minimizing the number of shadow models. First, our motivational experiments suggest memorization as the key property explaining disparate sample vulnerability to MIAs. We formalize this through a theoretical bound that connects MI advantage with memorization. Second, we show sample complexity bounds that connect the number of shadow models needed for MIAs with memorization. Lastly, we confirm our theoretical arguments with comprehensive experiments; by utilizing samples with high memorization scores, the adversary can (a) significantly improve its efficacy regardless of the MIA used, and (b) reduce the number of shadow models by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- `2310.08083v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08083v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08083v1)

> One of the most important tasks related to managing bug reports is localizing the fault so that a fix can be applied. As such, prior work has aimed to automate this task of bug localization by formulating it as an information retrieval problem, where potentially buggy files are retrieved and ranked according to their textual similarity with a given bug report. However, there is often a notable semantic gap between the information contained in bug reports and identifiers or natural language contained within source code files. For user-facing software, there is currently a key source of information that could aid in bug localization, but has not been thoroughly investigated - information from the GUI.   We investigate the hypothesis that, for end user-facing applications, connecting information in a bug report with information from the GUI, and using this to aid in retrieving potentially buggy files, can improve upon existing techniques for bug localization. To examine this phenomenon, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study that augments four baseline techniques for bug localization with GUI interaction information from a reproduction scenario to (i) filter out potentially irrelevant files, (ii) boost potentially relevant files, and (iii) reformulate text-retrieval queries. To carry out our study, we source the current largest dataset of fully-localized and reproducible real bugs for Android apps, with corresponding bug reports, consisting of 80 bug reports from 39 popular open-source apps. Our results illustrate that augmenting traditional techniques with GUI information leads to a marked increase in effectiveness across multiple metrics, including a relative increase in Hits@10 of 13-18%. Additionally, through further analysis, we find that our studied augmentations largely complement existing techniques.

- `2310.08153v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08153v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08153v1)

> To protect cryptographic implementations from side-channel vulnerabilities, developers must adopt constant-time programming practices. As these can be error-prone, many side-channel detection tools have been proposed. Despite this, such vulnerabilities are still manually found in cryptographic libraries. While a recent paper by Jancar et al. shows that developers rarely perform side-channel detection, it is unclear if existing detection tools could have found these vulnerabilities in the first place. To answer this question, we surveyed the literature to build a classification of 34 side-channel detection frameworks. The classification we offer compares multiple criteria, including the methods used, the scalability of the analysis or the threat model considered. We then built a unified common benchmark of representative cryptographic operations on a selection of 5 promising detection tools. This benchmark allows us to better compare the capabilities of each tool, and the scalability of their analysis. Additionally, we offer a classification of recently published side-channel vulnerabilities. We then test each of the selected tools on benchmarks reproducing a subset of these vulnerabilities as well as the context in which they appear. We find that existing tools can struggle to find vulnerabilities for a variety of reasons, mainly the lack of support for SIMD instructions, implicit flows, and internal secret generation. Based on our findings, we develop a set of recommendations for the research community and cryptographic library developers, with the goal to improve the effectiveness of side-channel detection tools.

- *Cheongwoong Kang, Jaesik Choi*

- `2310.08256v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08256v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08256v1)

> Large language models (LLMs) often make factually incorrect responses despite their success in various applications. In this paper, we hypothesize that relying heavily on simple co-occurrence statistics of the pre-training corpora is one of the main factors that cause factual errors. Our results reveal that LLMs are vulnerable to the co-occurrence bias, defined as preferring frequently co-occurred words over the correct answer. Consequently, LLMs struggle to recall facts whose subject and object rarely co-occur in the pre-training dataset although they are seen during finetuning. We show that co-occurrence bias remains despite scaling up model sizes or finetuning. Therefore, we suggest finetuning on a debiased dataset to mitigate the bias by filtering out biased samples whose subject-object co-occurrence count is high. Although debiased finetuning allows LLMs to memorize rare facts in the training set, it is not effective in recalling rare facts unseen during finetuning. Further research in mitigation will help build reliable language models by preventing potential errors. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/CheongWoong/impact_of_cooccurrence}.

> Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a widely used tool to extract text from scanned documents. Today, the state-of-the-art is achieved by exploiting deep neural networks. However, the cost of this performance is paid at the price of system vulnerability. For instance, in backdoor attacks, attackers compromise the training phase by inserting a backdoor in the victim's model that will be activated at testing time by specific patterns while leaving the overall model performance intact. This work proposes a backdoor attack for OCR resulting in the injection of non-readable characters from malicious input images. This simple but effective attack exposes the state-of-the-art OCR weakness, making the extracted text correct to human eyes but simultaneously unusable for the NLP application that uses OCR as a preprocessing step. Experimental results show that the attacked models successfully output non-readable characters for around 90% of the poisoned instances without harming their performance for the remaining instances.

- `2310.08837v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08837v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08837v1)

> The escalating complexity of software systems and accelerating development cycles pose a significant challenge in managing code errors and implementing business logic. Traditional techniques, while cornerstone for software quality assurance, exhibit limitations in handling intricate business logic and extensive codebases. To address these challenges, we introduce the Intelligent Code Analysis Agent (ICAA), a novel concept combining AI models, engineering process designs, and traditional non-AI components. The ICAA employs the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 or GPT-4 to automatically detect and diagnose code errors and business logic inconsistencies. In our exploration of this concept, we observed a substantial improvement in bug detection accuracy, reducing the false-positive rate to 66\% from the baseline's 85\%, and a promising recall rate of 60.8\%. However, the token consumption cost associated with LLMs, particularly the average cost for analyzing each line of code, remains a significant consideration for widespread adoption. Despite this challenge, our findings suggest that the ICAA holds considerable potential to revolutionize software quality assurance, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of bug detection in the software development process. We hope this pioneering work will inspire further research and innovation in this field, focusing on refining the ICAA concept and exploring ways to mitigate the associated costs.

> Trajectory data has the potential to greatly benefit a wide-range of real-world applications, such as tracking the spread of the disease through people's movement patterns and providing personalized location-based services based on travel preference. However, privay concerns and data protection regulations have limited the extent to which this data is shared and utilized. To overcome this challenge, local differential privacy provides a solution by allowing people to share a perturbed version of their data, ensuring privacy as only the data owners have access to the original information. Despite its potential, existing point-based perturbation mechanisms are not suitable for real-world scenarios due to poor utility, dependence on external knowledge, high computational overhead, and vulnerability to attacks. To address these limitations, we introduce LDPTrace, a novel locally differentially private trajectory synthesis framework. Our framework takes into account three crucial patterns inferred from users' trajectories in the local setting, allowing us to synthesize trajectories that closely resemble real ones with minimal computational cost. Additionally, we present a new method for selecting a proper grid granularity without compromising privacy. Our extensive experiments using real-world data, various utility metrics and attacks, demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of LDPTrace.

> Blockchain security is becoming increasingly relevant in today's cyberspace as it extends its influence in many industries. This paper focuses on protecting the lowest level layer in the blockchain, particularly the P2P network that allows the nodes to communicate and share information. The P2P network layer may be vulnerable to several families of attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), eclipse attacks, or Sybil attacks. This layer is prone to threats inherited from traditional P2P networks, and it must be analyzed and understood by collecting data and extracting insights from the network behavior to reduce those risks. We introduce Tikuna, an open-source tool for monitoring and detecting potential attacks on the Ethereum blockchain P2P network, at an early stage. Tikuna employs an unsupervised Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect attacks and alert users. Empirical results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves detection performance, with the ability to detect and classify attacks, including eclipse attacks, Covert Flash attacks, and others that target the Ethereum blockchain P2P network layer, with high accuracy. Our research findings demonstrate that Tikuna is a valuable security tool for assisting operators to efficiently monitor and safeguard the status of Ethereum validators and the wider P2P network

> Over the years, researchers have developed myriad attacks that exploit the ubiquity of adversarial examples, as well as defenses that aim to guard against the security vulnerabilities posed by such attacks. Of particular interest to this paper are defenses that provide provable guarantees against the class of $\ell_p$-bounded attacks. Certified defenses have made significant progress, taking robustness certification from toy models and datasets to large-scale problems like ImageNet classification. While this is undoubtedly an interesting academic problem, as the field has matured, its impact in practice remains unclear, thus we find it useful to revisit the motivation for continuing this line of research. There are three layers to this inquiry, which we address in this paper: (1) why do we care about robustness research? (2) why do we care about the $\ell_p$-bounded threat model? And (3) why do we care about certification as opposed to empirical defenses? In brief, we take the position that local robustness certification indeed confers practical value to the field of machine learning. We focus especially on the latter two questions from above. With respect to the first of the two, we argue that the $\ell_p$-bounded threat model acts as a minimal requirement for safe application of models in security-critical domains, while at the same time, evidence has mounted suggesting that local robustness may lead to downstream external benefits not immediately related to robustness. As for the second, we argue that (i) certification provides a resolution to the cat-and-mouse game of adversarial attacks; and furthermore, that (ii) perhaps contrary to popular belief, there may not exist a fundamental trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and certifiability, while moreover, certified training techniques constitute a particularly promising way for learning robust models.

> Adversarial examples can be useful for identifying vulnerabilities in AI systems before they are deployed. In reinforcement learning (RL), adversarial policies can be developed by training an adversarial agent to minimize a target agent's rewards. Prior work has studied black-box versions of these attacks where the adversary only observes the world state and treats the target agent as any other part of the environment. However, this does not take into account additional structure in the problem. In this work, we study white-box adversarial policies and show that having access to a target agent's internal state can be useful for identifying its vulnerabilities. We make two contributions. (1) We introduce white-box adversarial policies where an attacker observes both a target's internal state and the world state at each timestep. We formulate ways of using these policies to attack agents in 2-player games and text-generating language models. (2) We demonstrate that these policies can achieve higher initial and asymptotic performance against a target agent than black-box controls.

> Modern automated surveillance techniques are heavily reliant on deep learning methods. Despite the superior performance, these learning systems are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks - maliciously crafted inputs that are designed to mislead, or trick, models into making incorrect predictions. An adversary can physically change their appearance by wearing adversarial t-shirts, glasses, or hats or by specific behavior, to potentially avoid various forms of detection, tracking and recognition of surveillance systems; and obtain unauthorized access to secure properties and assets. This poses a severe threat to the security and safety of modern surveillance systems. This paper reviews recent attempts and findings in learning and designing physical adversarial attacks for surveillance applications. In particular, we propose a framework to analyze physical adversarial attacks and provide a comprehensive survey of physical adversarial attacks on four key surveillance tasks: detection, identification, tracking, and action recognition under this framework. Furthermore, we review and analyze strategies to defend against the physical adversarial attacks and the methods for evaluating the strengths of the defense. The insights in this paper present an important step in building resilience within surveillance systems to physical adversarial attacks.

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate text and other modalities (especially vision) have achieved unprecedented performance in various multimodal tasks. However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness problem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks by introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial robustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its multimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of commercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs, the generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image descriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We show that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26% attack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against ERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face detection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to evade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also vulnerable. We hope this work can deepen our understanding on the robustness of MLLMs and facilitate future research on defenses. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/Attack-Bard.   Update: GPT-4V is available at October 2023. We further evaluate its robustness under the same set of adversarial examples, achieving a 45% attack success rate.

> Prompt-tuning has emerged as an attractive paradigm for deploying large-scale language models due to its strong downstream task performance and efficient multitask serving ability. Despite its wide adoption, we empirically show that prompt-tuning is vulnerable to downstream task-agnostic backdoors, which reside in the pretrained models and can affect arbitrary downstream tasks. The state-of-the-art backdoor detection approaches cannot defend against task-agnostic backdoors since they hardly converge in reversing the backdoor triggers. To address this issue, we propose LMSanitator, a novel approach for detecting and removing task-agnostic backdoors on Transformer models. Instead of directly inverting the triggers, LMSanitator aims to invert the predefined attack vectors (pretrained models' output when the input is embedded with triggers) of the task-agnostic backdoors, which achieves much better convergence performance and backdoor detection accuracy. LMSanitator further leverages prompt-tuning's property of freezing the pretrained model to perform accurate and fast output monitoring and input purging during the inference phase. Extensive experiments on multiple language models and NLP tasks illustrate the effectiveness of LMSanitator. For instance, LMSanitator achieves 92.8% backdoor detection accuracy on 960 models and decreases the attack success rate to less than 1% in most scenarios.

> Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a sought-after distributed machine learning architecture, offering the advantage of model training without direct exposure of raw data. With advancements in network infrastructure, FL has been seamlessly integrated into edge computing. However, the limited resources on edge devices introduce security vulnerabilities to FL in the context. While blockchain technology promises to bolster security, practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains a challenge. Moreover, the exploration of FL with multiple aggregators in edge computing is still new in the literature. Addressing these gaps, we introduce the Blockchain-empowered Heterogeneous Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture (BMA-FL). We design a novel light-weight Byzantine consensus mechanism, namely PBCM, to enable secure and fast model aggregation and synchronization in BMA-FL. We also dive into the heterogeneity problem in BMA-FL that the aggregators are associated with varied number of connected trainers with Non-IID data distributions and diverse training speed. We proposed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to help aggregators decide the best training strategies. The experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate the efficiency of BMA-FL to achieve better models faster than baselines, showing the efficacy of PBCM and proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

> The worst-case resource usage of a program can provide useful information for many software-engineering tasks, such as performance optimization and algorithmic-complexity-vulnerability discovery. This paper presents a generic, adaptive, and sound fuzzing framework, called DSE-SMC, for estimating worst-case resource usage. DSE-SMC is generic because it is black-box as long as the user provides an interface for retrieving resource-usage information on a given input; adaptive because it automatically balances between exploration and exploitation of candidate inputs; and sound because it is guaranteed to converge to the true resource-usage distribution of the analyzed program.   DSE-SMC is built upon a key observation: resource accumulation in a program is isomorphic to the soft-conditioning mechanism in Bayesian probabilistic programming; thus, worst-case resource analysis is isomorphic to the maximum-a-posteriori-estimation problem of Bayesian statistics. DSE-SMC incorporates sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) -- a generic framework for Bayesian inference -- with adaptive evolutionary fuzzing algorithms, in a sound manner, i.e., DSE-SMC asymptotically converges to the posterior distribution induced by resource-usage behavior of the analyzed program. Experimental evaluation on Java applications demonstrates that DSE-SMC is significantly more effective than existing black-box fuzzing methods for worst-case analysis.

> Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including Homogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HomoGNNs) and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HeteGNNs), have made remarkable progress in many physical scenarios, especially in communication applications. Despite achieving great success, the privacy issue of such models has also received considerable attention. Previous studies have shown that given a well-fitted target GNN, the attacker can reconstruct the sensitive training graph of this model via model inversion attacks, leading to significant privacy worries for the AI service provider. We advocate that the vulnerability comes from the target GNN itself and the prior knowledge about the shared properties in real-world graphs. Inspired by this, we propose a novel model inversion attack method on HomoGNNs and HeteGNNs, namely HomoGMI and HeteGMI. Specifically, HomoGMI and HeteGMI are gradient-descent-based optimization methods that aim to maximize the cross-entropy loss on the target GNN and the $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$-order proximities on the reconstructed graph. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, HeteGMI is the first attempt to perform model inversion attacks on HeteGNNs. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the competitors.

> Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (i.e., gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4) exhibited remarkable advancement in a range of software engineering tasks associated with source code such as code review and code generation. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study by instructing ChatGPT for four prevalent vulnerability tasks: function and line-level vulnerability prediction, vulnerability classification, severity estimation, and vulnerability repair. We compare ChatGPT with state-of-the-art language models designed for software vulnerability purposes. Through an empirical assessment employing extensive real-world datasets featuring over 190,000 C/C++ functions, we found that ChatGPT achieves limited performance, trailing behind other language models in vulnerability contexts by a significant margin. The experimental outcomes highlight the challenging nature of vulnerability prediction tasks, requiring domain-specific expertise. Despite ChatGPT's substantial model scale, exceeding that of source code-pre-trained language models (e.g., CodeBERT) by a factor of 14,000, the process of fine-tuning remains imperative for ChatGPT to generalize for vulnerability prediction tasks.

> Large language models (LLMs) have been treated as knowledge bases due to their strong performance in knowledge probing tasks. LLMs are typically evaluated using accuracy, yet this metric does not capture the vulnerability of LLMs to hallucination-inducing factors like prompt and context variability. How do we evaluate the capabilities of LLMs to consistently produce factually correct answers? In this paper, we propose MOdel kNowledge relIabiliTy scORe (MONITOR), a novel metric designed to directly measure LLMs' factual reliability. MONITOR computes the distance between the probability distributions of a valid output and its counterparts produced by the same LLM probing the same fact using different styles of prompts and contexts.Experiments on a comprehensive range of 12 LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of MONITOR in evaluating the factual reliability of LLMs while maintaining a low computational overhead. In addition, we release the FKTC (Factual Knowledge Test Corpus) test set, containing 210,158 prompts in total to foster research along this line (https://github.com/Vicky-Wil/MONITOR).

> Recently, Large language models (LLMs) with powerful general capabilities have been increasingly integrated into various Web applications, while undergoing alignment training to ensure that the generated content aligns with user intent and ethics. Unfortunately, they remain the risk of generating harmful content like hate speech and criminal activities in practical applications. Current approaches primarily rely on detecting, collecting, and training against harmful prompts to prevent such risks. However, they typically focused on the "superficial" harmful prompts with a solitary intent, ignoring composite attack instructions with multiple intentions that can easily elicit harmful content in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique for obfuscating harmful instructions: Compositional Instruction Attacks (CIA), which refers to attacking by combination and encapsulation of multiple instructions. CIA hides harmful prompts within instructions of harmless intentions, making it impossible for the model to identify underlying malicious intentions. Furthermore, we implement two transformation methods, known as T-CIA and W-CIA, to automatically disguise harmful instructions as talking or writing tasks, making them appear harmless to LLMs. We evaluated CIA on GPT-4, ChatGPT, and ChatGLM2 with two safety assessment datasets and two harmful prompt datasets. It achieves an attack success rate of 95%+ on safety assessment datasets, and 83%+ for GPT-4, 91%+ for ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo backed) and ChatGLM2-6B on harmful prompt datasets. Our approach reveals the vulnerability of LLMs to such compositional instruction attacks that harbor underlying harmful intentions, contributing significantly to LLM security development.

> In scenarios with long-tailed distributions, the model's ability to identify tail classes is limited due to the under-representation of tail samples. Class rebalancing, information augmentation, and other techniques have been proposed to facilitate models to learn the potential distribution of tail classes. The disadvantage is that these methods generally pursue models with balanced class accuracy on the data manifold, while ignoring the ability of the model to resist interference. By constructing noisy data manifold, we found that the robustness of models trained on unbalanced data has a long-tail phenomenon. That is, even if the class accuracy is balanced on the data domain, it still has bias on the noisy data manifold. However, existing methods cannot effectively mitigate the above phenomenon, which makes the model vulnerable in long-tailed scenarios. In this work, we propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty Representation (OUR) of feature embedding and an end-to-end training strategy to improve the long-tail phenomenon of model robustness. As a general enhancement tool, OUR has excellent compatibility with other methods and does not require additional data generation, ensuring fast and efficient training. Comprehensive evaluations on long-tailed datasets show that our method significantly improves the long-tail phenomenon of robustness, bringing consistent performance gains to other long-tailed learning methods.

> Training a machine learning model with data following a meaningful order, i.e., from easy to hard, has been proven to be effective in accelerating the training process and achieving better model performance. The key enabling technique is curriculum learning (CL), which has seen great success and has been deployed in areas like image and text classification. Yet, how CL affects the privacy of machine learning is unclear. Given that CL changes the way a model memorizes the training data, its influence on data privacy needs to be thoroughly evaluated. To fill this knowledge gap, we perform the first study and leverage membership inference attack (MIA) and attribute inference attack (AIA) as two vectors to quantify the privacy leakage caused by CL.   Our evaluation of nine real-world datasets with attack methods (NN-based, metric-based, label-only MIA, and NN-based AIA) revealed new insights about CL. First, MIA becomes slightly more effective when CL is applied, but the impact is much more prominent to a subset of training samples ranked as difficult. Second, a model trained under CL is less vulnerable under AIA, compared to MIA. Third, the existing defense techniques like DP-SGD, MemGuard, and MixupMMD are still effective under CL, though DP-SGD has a significant impact on target model accuracy. Finally, based on our insights into CL, we propose a new MIA, termed Diff-Cali, which exploits the difficulty scores for result calibration and is demonstrated to be effective against all CL methods and the normal training method. With this study, we hope to draw the community's attention to the unintended privacy risks of emerging machine-learning techniques and develop new attack benchmarks and defense solutions.

> The healthcare sector is increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks due to its growing digitalization. Patient data, including medical records and financial information, are at risk, potentially leading to identity theft and patient safety concerns. The European Union and other organizations identify key areas for healthcare system improvement, yet the industry still grapples with inadequate security practices. In response, the HEIR project offers a comprehensive cybersecurity approach, promoting security features from various regulatory frameworks and introducing tools such as the Secure Healthcare Framework and Risk Assessment for Medical Applications (RAMA). These measures aim to enhance digital health security and protect sensitive patient data while facilitating secure data access and privacy-aware techniques. In a rapidly evolving threat landscape, HEIR presents a promising framework for healthcare cybersecurity.

> Software Heritage is the largest public archive of software source code and associated development history, as captured by modern version control systems. As of July 2023, it has archived more than 16 billion unique source code files coming from more than 250 million collaborative development projects. In this chapter, we describe the Software Heritage ecosystem, focusing on research and open science use cases.On the one hand, Software Heritage supports empirical research on software by materializing in a single Merkle direct acyclic graph the development history of public code. This giant graph of source code artifacts (files, directories, and commits) can be used-and has been used-to study repository forks, open source contributors, vulnerability propagation, software provenance tracking, source code indexing, and more.On the other hand, Software Heritage ensures availability and guarantees integrity of the source code of software artifacts used in any field that relies on software to conduct experiments, contributing to making research reproducible. The source code used in scientific experiments can be archived-e.g., via integration with open-access repositories-referenced using persistent identifiers that allow downstream integrity checks and linked to/from other scholarly digital artifacts.

> Connected vehicles are vulnerable to manipulation and a broad attack surface can be used to intrude in-vehicle networks from anywhere on earth. In this work, we present an integrated security infrastructure comprising network protection, monitoring, incident management, and counteractions, which we built into a prototype based on a production car. Our vehicle implements a Software-Defined Networking Ethernet backbone to restrict communication routes, network anomaly detection to make misbehavior evident, virtual controller functions to enable agile countermeasures, and an automotive cloud defense center to analyse and manage incidents on vehicle fleets. We present first measurements and lessons learned from operating the prototype: many network attacks can be prevented through software-defined access control in the backbone; anomaly detection can reliably detect misbehavior but needs to improve on false positive rate; controller virtualization needs tailored frameworks to meet in-car requirements; and cloud defence enables fleet management and advanced countermeasures. Our findings indicate attack mitigation times in the vehicle from 257 ms to 328 ms and from 2,168 ms to 2,713 ms traversing the cloud.

> Recent works have brought attention to the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) systems to gradient leakage attacks. Such attacks exploit clients' uploaded gradients to reconstruct their sensitive data, thereby compromising the privacy protection capability of FL. In response, various defense mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this threat by manipulating the uploaded gradients. Unfortunately, empirical evaluations have demonstrated limited resilience of these defenses against sophisticated attacks, indicating an urgent need for more effective defenses. In this paper, we explore a novel defensive paradigm that departs from conventional gradient perturbation approaches and instead focuses on the construction of robust data. Intuitively, if robust data exhibits low semantic similarity with clients' raw data, the gradients associated with robust data can effectively obfuscate attackers. To this end, we design Refiner that jointly optimizes two metrics for privacy protection and performance maintenance. The utility metric is designed to promote consistency between the gradients of key parameters associated with robust data and those derived from clients' data, thus maintaining model performance. Furthermore, the privacy metric guides the generation of robust data towards enlarging the semantic gap with clients' data. Theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of Refiner, and empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior defense effectiveness of Refiner at defending against state-of-the-art attacks.

> Machine learning models are increasingly used in fields that require high reliability such as cybersecurity. However, these models remain vulnerable to various attacks, among which the adversarial label-flipping attack poses significant threats. In label-flipping attacks, the adversary maliciously flips a portion of training labels to compromise the machine learning model. This paper raises significant concerns as these attacks can camouflage a highly skewed dataset as an easily solvable classification problem, often misleading machine learning practitioners into lower defenses and miscalculations of potential risks. This concern amplifies in tabular data settings, where identifying true labels requires expertise, allowing malicious label-flipping attacks to easily slip under the radar. To demonstrate this risk is inherited in the adversary's objective, we propose FALFA (Fast Adversarial Label-Flipping Attack), a novel efficient attack for crafting adversarial labels. FALFA is based on transforming the adversary's objective and employs linear programming to reduce computational complexity. Using ten real-world tabular datasets, we demonstrate FALFA's superior attack potential, highlighting the need for robust defenses against such threats.

> This paper provides a systematic analysis of the opportunities, challenges, and potential solutions of harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to dig out vulnerabilities within smart contracts based on our ongoing research. For the task of smart contract vulnerability detection, achieving practical usability hinges on identifying as many true vulnerabilities as possible while minimizing the number of false positives. Nonetheless, our empirical study reveals contradictory yet interesting findings: generating more answers with higher randomness largely boosts the likelihood of producing a correct answer but inevitably leads to a higher number of false positives. To mitigate this tension, we propose an adversarial framework dubbed GPTLens that breaks the conventional one-stage detection into two synergistic stages $-$ generation and discrimination, for progressive detection and refinement, wherein the LLM plays dual roles, i.e., auditor and critic, respectively. The goal of auditor is to yield a broad spectrum of vulnerabilities with the hope of encompassing the correct answer, whereas the goal of critic that evaluates the validity of identified vulnerabilities is to minimize the number of false positives. Experimental results and illustrative examples demonstrate that auditor and critic work together harmoniously to yield pronounced improvements over the conventional one-stage detection. GPTLens is intuitive, strategic, and entirely LLM-driven without relying on specialist expertise in smart contracts, showcasing its methodical generality and potential to detect a broad spectrum of vulnerabilities. Our code is available at: https://github.com/git-disl/GPTLens.

> State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small input perturbations that are adversarially constructed. Adversarial training is an effective approach to defend against it. Formulated as a min-max problem, it searches for the best solution when the training data were corrupted by the worst-case attacks. Linear models are among the simple models where vulnerabilities can be observed and are the focus of our study. In this case, adversarial training leads to a convex optimization problem which can be formulated as the minimization of a finite sum. We provide a comparative analysis between the solution of adversarial training in linear regression and other regularization methods. Our main findings are that: (A) Adversarial training yields the minimum-norm interpolating solution in the overparameterized regime (more parameters than data), as long as the maximum disturbance radius is smaller than a threshold. And, conversely, the minimum-norm interpolator is the solution to adversarial training with a given radius. (B) Adversarial training can be equivalent to parameter shrinking methods (ridge regression and Lasso). This happens in the underparametrized region, for an appropriate choice of adversarial radius and zero-mean symmetrically distributed covariates. (C) For $\ell_\infty$-adversarial training -- as in square-root Lasso -- the choice of adversarial radius for optimal bounds does not depend on the additive noise variance. We confirm our theoretical findings with numerical examples.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are swiftly advancing in architecture and capability, and as they integrate more deeply into complex systems, the urgency to scrutinize their security properties grows. This paper surveys research in the emerging interdisciplinary field of adversarial attacks on LLMs, a subfield of trustworthy ML, combining the perspectives of Natural Language Processing and Security. Prior work has shown that even safety-aligned LLMs (via instruction tuning and reinforcement learning through human feedback) can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, which exploit weaknesses and mislead AI systems, as evidenced by the prevalence of `jailbreak' attacks on models like ChatGPT and Bard. In this survey, we first provide an overview of large language models, describe their safety alignment, and categorize existing research based on various learning structures: textual-only attacks, multi-modal attacks, and additional attack methods specifically targeting complex systems, such as federated learning or multi-agent systems. We also offer comprehensive remarks on works that focus on the fundamental sources of vulnerabilities and potential defenses. To make this field more accessible to newcomers, we present a systematic review of existing works, a structured typology of adversarial attack concepts, and additional resources, including slides for presentations on related topics at the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL'24).

This survey reviews a particular subset of this literature that focuses on investigating properties of training data in the context of model robustness under evasion attacks. It first summarizes the main properties of data leading to adversarial vulnerability.

> Today, the security of many domains rely on the use of Machine Learning to detect threats, identify vulnerabilities, and safeguard systems from attacks. Recently, transformer architectures have improved the state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks such as malware detection and network intrusion detection. But, before abandoning current approaches to transformers, it is crucial to understand their properties and implications on cybersecurity applications. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of transformers to adversarial samples for system defenders (i.e., resiliency to adversarial perturbations generated on different types of architectures) and their adversarial strength for system attackers (i.e., transferability of adversarial samples generated by transformers to other target models). To that effect, we first fine-tune a set of pre-trained transformer, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and hybrid (an ensemble of transformer and CNN) models to solve different downstream image-based tasks. Then, we use an attack algorithm to craft 19,367 adversarial examples on each model for each task. The transferability of these adversarial examples is measured by evaluating each set on other models to determine which models offer more adversarial strength, and consequently, more robustness against these attacks. We find that the adversarial examples crafted on transformers offer the highest transferability rate (i.e., 25.7% higher than the average) onto other models. Similarly, adversarial examples crafted on other models have the lowest rate of transferability (i.e., 56.7% lower than the average) onto transformers. Our work emphasizes the importance of studying transformer architectures for attacking and defending models in security domains, and suggests using them as the primary architecture in transfer attack settings.

> Existing research on malware classification focuses almost exclusively on two tasks: distinguishing between malicious and benign files and classifying malware by family. However, malware can be categorized according to many other types of attributes, and the ability to identify these attributes in newly-emerging malware using machine learning could provide significant value to analysts. In particular, we have identified four tasks which are under-represented in prior work: classification by behaviors that malware exhibit, platforms that malware run on, vulnerabilities that malware exploit, and packers that malware are packed with. To obtain labels for training and evaluating ML classifiers on these tasks, we created an antivirus (AV) tagging tool called ClarAVy. ClarAVy's sophisticated AV label parser distinguishes itself from prior AV-based taggers, with the ability to accurately parse 882 different AV label formats used by 90 different AV products. We are releasing benchmark datasets for each of these four classification tasks, tagged using ClarAVy and comprising nearly 5.5 million malicious files in total. Our malware behavior dataset includes 75 distinct tags - nearly 7x more than the only prior benchmark dataset with behavioral tags. To our knowledge, we are the first to release datasets with malware platform and packer tags.

> Currently the state of the art network models are based or depend on Discrete Event Simulation (DES). While DES is highly accurate, it is also computationally costly and cumbersome to parallelize, making it unpractical to simulate high performance networks. Additionally, simulated scenarios fail to capture all of the complexities present in real network scenarios. While there exists network models based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to minimize these issues, these models are also trained with simulated data and hence vulnerable to the same pitfalls. Consequently, the Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2023 introduces a dataset of captured traffic traces that can be used to build a ML-based network model without these limitations. In this paper we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based solution specifically designed to better capture the complexities of real network scenarios. This is done through a novel encoding method to capture information from the sequence of captured packets, and an improved message passing algorithm to better represent the dependencies present in physical networks. We show that the proposed solution it is able to learn and generalize to unseen captured network scenarios.

> We introduce SCooLS, our Smart Contract Learning (Semi-supervised) engine. SCooLS uses neural networks to analyze Ethereum contract bytecode and identifies specific vulnerable functions. SCooLS incorporates two key elements: semi-supervised learning and graph neural networks (GNNs). Semi-supervised learning produces more accurate models than unsupervised learning, while not requiring the large oracle-labeled training set that supervised learning requires. GNNs enable direct analysis of smart contract bytecode without any manual feature engineering, predefined patterns, or expert rules. SCooLS is the first application of semi-supervised learning to smart contract vulnerability analysis, as well as the first deep learning-based vulnerability analyzer to identify specific vulnerable functions. SCooLS's performance is better than existing tools, with an accuracy level of 98.4%, an F1 score of 90.5%, and an exceptionally low false positive rate of only 0.8%. Furthermore, SCooLS is fast, analyzing a typical function in 0.05 seconds. We leverage SCooLS's ability to identify specific vulnerable functions to build an exploit generator, which was successful in stealing Ether from 76.9% of the true positives.

> Large-scale pre-trained models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through a new paradigm called prompt learning. In contrast to fine-tuning, prompt learning does not update the pre-trained model's parameters. Instead, it only learns an input perturbation, namely prompt, to be added to the downstream task data for predictions. Given the fast development of prompt learning, a well-generalized prompt inevitably becomes a valuable asset as significant effort and proprietary data are used to create it. This naturally raises the question of whether a prompt may leak the proprietary information of its training data. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive privacy assessment of prompts learned by visual prompt learning through the lens of property inference and membership inference attacks. Our empirical evaluation shows that the prompts are vulnerable to both attacks. We also demonstrate that the adversary can mount a successful property inference attack with limited cost. Moreover, we show that membership inference attacks against prompts can be successful with relaxed adversarial assumptions. We further make some initial investigations on the defenses and observe that our method can mitigate the membership inference attacks with a decent utility-defense trade-off but fails to defend against property inference attacks. We hope our results can shed light on the privacy risks of the popular prompt learning paradigm. To facilitate the research in this direction, we will share our code and models with the community.

> Face forgery generation technologies generate vivid faces, which have raised public concerns about security and privacy. Many intelligent systems, such as electronic payment and identity verification, rely on face forgery detection. Although face forgery detection has successfully distinguished fake faces, recent studies have demonstrated that face forgery detectors are very vulnerable to adversarial examples. Meanwhile, existing attacks rely on network architectures or training datasets instead of the predicted labels, which leads to a gap in attacking deployed applications. To narrow this gap, we first explore the decision-based attacks on face forgery detection. However, applying existing decision-based attacks directly suffers from perturbation initialization failure and low image quality. First, we propose cross-task perturbation to handle initialization failures by utilizing the high correlation of face features on different tasks. Then, inspired by using frequency cues by face forgery detection, we propose the frequency decision-based attack. We add perturbations in the frequency domain and then constrain the visual quality in the spatial domain. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance on FaceForensics++, CelebDF, and industrial APIs, with high query efficiency and guaranteed image quality. Further, the fake faces by our method can pass face forgery detection and face recognition, which exposes the security problems of face forgery detectors.

We used two open-source Apache Commons Project's Java components for training and evaluating the models. Our experimental findings indicate that the ensemble of AI models can outperform the results of applying individual AI models. We also offer insight into the factors that contribute to the enhanced performance of the ensemble AI model. The presented results demonstrate the potential of using ensemble AI models to enhance bug prediction results, which could ultimately result in more reliable software systems.

> Deep Learning models, such as those used in an autonomous vehicle are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where an attacker could place an adversarial object in the environment, leading to mis-classification. Generating these adversarial objects in the digital space has been extensively studied, however successfully transferring these attacks from the digital realm to the physical realm has proven challenging when controlling for real-world environmental factors. In response to these limitations, we introduce REVAMP, an easy-to-use Python library that is the first-of-its-kind tool for creating attack scenarios with arbitrary objects and simulating realistic environmental factors, lighting, reflection, and refraction. REVAMP enables researchers and practitioners to swiftly explore various scenarios within the digital realm by offering a wide range of configurable options for designing experiments and using differentiable rendering to reproduce physically plausible adversarial objects. We will demonstrate and invite the audience to try REVAMP to produce an adversarial texture on a chosen object while having control over various scene parameters. The audience will choose a scene, an object to attack, the desired attack class, and the number of camera positions to use. Then, in real time, we show how this altered texture causes the chosen object to be mis-classified, showcasing the potential of REVAMP in real-world scenarios. REVAMP is open-source and available at https://github.com/poloclub/revamp.

> The widespread deployment of "smart" electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) will be a key step toward achieving green transportation. The connectivity features of smart EVCSs can be utilized to schedule EV charging operations while respecting user preferences, thus avoiding synchronous charging from a large number of customers and relieving grid congestion. However, the communication and connectivity requirements involved in smart charging raise cybersecurity concerns. In this work, we investigate charge manipulation attacks (CMAs) against EV charging, in which an attacker manipulates the information exchanged during smart charging operations. The objective of CMAs is to shift the EV aggregator's demand across different times of the day. The proposed CMAs can bypass existing protection mechanisms in EV communication protocols. We quantify the impact of CMAs on the EV aggregator's economic profit by modeling their participation in the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets. Finally, we propose an unsupervised deep learning-based mechanism to detect CMAs by monitoring the parameters involved in EV charging. We extensively analyze the attack impact and the efficiency of the proposed detection on real-world EV charging datasets. The results highlight the vulnerabilities of smart charging operations and the need for a monitoring mechanism to detect malicious CMAs.

> Deep Learning models have shown remarkable performance in a broad range of vision tasks. However, they are often vulnerable against domain shifts at test-time. Test-time training (TTT) methods have been developed in an attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities, where a secondary task is solved at training time simultaneously with the main task, to be later used as an self-supervised proxy task at test-time. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised TTT technique based on the maximization of Mutual Information between multi-scale feature maps and a discrete latent representation, which can be integrated to the standard training as an auxiliary clustering task. Experimental results demonstrate competitive classification performance on different popular test-time adaptation benchmarks.

> In the realm of deep learning, transformers have emerged as a dominant architecture, particularly in natural language processing tasks. However, with their widespread adoption, concerns regarding the security and privacy of the data processed by these models have arisen. In this paper, we address a pivotal question: Can the data fed into transformers be recovered using their attention weights and outputs? We introduce a theoretical framework to tackle this problem. Specifically, we present an algorithm that aims to recover the input data $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ from given attention weights $W = QK^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ and output $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ by minimizing the loss function $L(X)$. This loss function captures the discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output of the transformer. Our findings have significant implications for the Localized Layer-wise Mechanism (LLM), suggesting potential vulnerabilities in the model's design from a security and privacy perspective. This work underscores the importance of understanding and safeguarding the internal workings of transformers to ensure the confidentiality of processed data.

> While advanced machine learning (ML) models are deployed in numerous real-world applications, previous works demonstrate these models have security and privacy vulnerabilities. Various empirical research has been done in this field. However, most of the experiments are performed on target ML models trained by the security researchers themselves. Due to the high computational resource requirement for training advanced models with complex architectures, researchers generally choose to train a few target models using relatively simple architectures on typical experiment datasets. We argue that to understand ML models' vulnerabilities comprehensively, experiments should be performed on a large set of models trained with various purposes (not just the purpose of evaluating ML attacks and defenses). To this end, we propose using publicly available models with weights from the Internet (public models) for evaluating attacks and defenses on ML models. We establish a database, namely SecurityNet, containing 910 annotated image classification models. We then analyze the effectiveness of several representative attacks/defenses, including model stealing attacks, membership inference attacks, and backdoor detection on these public models. Our evaluation empirically shows the performance of these attacks/defenses can vary significantly on public models compared to self-trained models. We share SecurityNet with the research community. and advocate researchers to perform experiments on public models to better demonstrate their proposed methods' effectiveness in the future.

> Recently, with the chain of thought (CoT) prompting, large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-3, have shown strong reasoning ability in several natural language processing tasks such as arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning. However, LLMs with CoT require multi-step prompting and multi-token prediction, which is highly sensitive to individual mistakes and vulnerable to error accumulation. The above issues make the LLMs need the ability to verify the answers. In fact, after inferring conclusions in some thinking decision tasks, people often check them by re-verifying steps to avoid some mistakes. In this paper, we propose and prove that LLMs also have similar self-verification abilities. We take the conclusion obtained by CoT as one of the conditions for solving the original problem. By performing a backward verification of the answers that LLM deduced for itself, we can obtain interpretable answer validation scores to select the candidate answer with the highest score. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the reasoning performance on various arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning datasets. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/WENGSYX/Self-Verification.

> Anonymity networks like Tor significantly enhance online privacy but are vulnerable to correlation attacks by state-level adversaries. While covert channels encapsulated in media protocols, particularly WebRTC-based encapsulation, have demonstrated effectiveness against passive traffic correlation attacks, their resilience against active correlation attacks remains unexplored, and their compatibility with Tor has been limited. This paper introduces TorKameleon, a censorship evasion solution designed to protect Tor users from both passive and active correlation attacks. TorKameleon employs K-anonymization techniques to fragment and reroute traffic through multiple TorKameleon proxies, while also utilizing covert WebRTC-based channels or TLS tunnels to encapsulate user traffic.

> Low-end embedded devices are increasingly used in various smart applications and spaces. They are implemented under strict cost and energy budgets, using microcontroller units (MCUs) that lack security features available in general-purpose processors. In this context, Remote Attestation (RA) was proposed as an inexpensive security service to enable a verifier (Vrf) to remotely detect illegal modifications to a software binary installed on a low-end prover MCU (Prv). Since attacks that hijack the software's control flow can evade RA, Control Flow Attestation (CFA) augments RA with information about the exact order in which instructions in the binary are executed, enabling detection of control flow attacks. We observe that current CFA architectures can not guarantee that Vrf ever receives control flow reports in case of attacks. In turn, while they support exploit detection, they provide no means to pinpoint the exploit origin. Furthermore, existing CFA requires either binary instrumentation, incurring significant runtime overhead and code size increase, or relatively expensive hardware support, such as hash engines. In addition, current techniques are neither continuous (only meant to attest self-contained operations) nor active (offer no secure means to remotely remediate detected compromises). To jointly address these challenges, we propose ACFA: a hybrid (hardware/software) architecture for Active CFA. ACFA enables continuous monitoring of all control flow transfers in the MCU and does not require binary instrumentation. It also leverages the recently proposed concept of Active Roots-of-Trust to enable secure auditing of vulnerability sources and guaranteed remediation when a compromise is detected. We provide an open-source reference implementation of ACFA on top of a commodity low-end MCU (TI MSP430) and evaluate it to demonstrate its security and cost-effectiveness.

> The combination of Deep Learning techniques and Raman spectroscopy shows great potential offering precise and prompt identification of pathogenic bacteria in clinical settings. However, the traditional closed-set classification approaches assume that all test samples belong to one of the known pathogens, and their applicability is limited since the clinical environment is inherently unpredictable and dynamic, unknown or emerging pathogens may not be included in the available catalogs. We demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art Neural Networks identifying pathogens through Raman spectra are vulnerable to unknown inputs, resulting in an uncontrollable false positive rate. To address this issue, first, we developed a novel ensemble of ResNet architectures combined with the attention mechanism which outperforms existing closed-world methods, achieving an accuracy of $87.8 \pm 0.1\%$ compared to the best available model's accuracy of $86.7 \pm 0.4\%$. Second, through the integration of feature regularization by the Objectosphere loss function, our model achieves both high accuracy in identifying known pathogens from the catalog and effectively separates unknown samples drastically reducing the false positive rate. Finally, the proposed feature regularization method during training significantly enhances the performance of out-of-distribution detectors during the inference phase improving the reliability of the detection of unknown classes. Our novel algorithm for Raman spectroscopy enables the detection of unknown, uncatalogued, and emerging pathogens providing the flexibility to adapt to future pathogens that may emerge, and has the potential to improve the reliability of Raman-based solutions in dynamic operating environments where accuracy is critical, such as public safety applications.

> Intrusion research frequently collects data on attack techniques currently employed and their potential symptoms. This includes deploying honeypots, logging events from existing devices, employing a red team for a sample attack campaign, or simulating system activity. However, these observational studies do not clearly discern the cause-and-effect relationships between the design of the environment and the data recorded. Neglecting such relationships increases the chance of drawing biased conclusions due to unconsidered factors, such as spurious correlations between features and errors in measurement or classification. In this paper, we present the theory and empirical data on methods that aim to discover such causal relationships efficiently. Our adaptive design (AD) is inspired by the clinical trial community: a variant of a randomized control trial (RCT) to measure how a particular ``treatment'' affects a population. To contrast our method with observational studies and RCT, we run the first controlled and adaptive honeypot deployment study, identifying the causal relationship between an ssh vulnerability and the rate of server exploitation. We demonstrate that our AD method decreases the total time needed to run the deployment by at least 33%, while still confidently stating the impact of our change in the environment. Compared to an analogous honeypot study with a control group, our AD requests 17% fewer honeypots while collecting 19% more attack recordings than an analogous honeypot study with a control group.

> Pre-trained models (PTMs) have been widely used in various downstream tasks. The parameters of PTMs are distributed on the Internet and may suffer backdoor attacks. In this work, we demonstrate the universal vulnerability of PTMs, where fine-tuned PTMs can be easily controlled by backdoor attacks in arbitrary downstream tasks. Specifically, attackers can add a simple pre-training task, which restricts the output representations of trigger instances to pre-defined vectors, namely neuron-level backdoor attack (NeuBA). If the backdoor functionality is not eliminated during fine-tuning, the triggers can make the fine-tuned model predict fixed labels by pre-defined vectors. In the experiments of both natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), we show that NeuBA absolutely controls the predictions for trigger instances without any knowledge of downstream tasks. Finally, we apply several defense methods to NeuBA and find that model pruning is a promising direction to resist NeuBA by excluding backdoored neurons. Our findings sound a red alarm for the wide use of PTMs. Our source code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/thunlp/NeuBA}.

> Embodied language comprehension emphasizes that language understanding is not solely a matter of mental processing in the brain but also involves interactions with the physical and social environment. With the explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their already ubiquitous presence in our daily lives, it is becoming increasingly necessary to verify their real-world understanding. Inspired by cognitive theories, we propose POSQA: a Physical Object Size Question Answering dataset with simple size comparison questions to examine the extremity and analyze the potential mechanisms of the embodied comprehension of the latest LLMs.   We show that even the largest LLMs today perform poorly under the zero-shot setting. We then push their limits with advanced prompting techniques and external knowledge augmentation. Furthermore, we investigate whether their real-world comprehension primarily derives from contextual information or internal weights and analyse the impact of prompt formats and report bias of different objects. Our results show that real-world understanding that LLMs shaped from textual data can be vulnerable to deception and confusion by the surface form of prompts, which makes it less aligned with human behaviours.

> Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning approach that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model. However, recent studies show that FL is vulnerable to various poisoning attacks, which can degrade the performance of global models or introduce backdoors into them. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study on prior FL attacks and detection methods. The results show that all existing detection methods are only effective against limited and specific attacks. Most detection methods suffer from high false positives, which lead to significant performance degradation, especially in not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings. To address these issues, we propose FLTracer, the first FL attack provenance framework to accurately detect various attacks and trace the attack time, objective, type, and poisoned location of updates. Different from existing methodologies that rely solely on cross-client anomaly detection, we propose a Kalman filter-based cross-round detection to identify adversaries by seeking the behavior changes before and after the attack. Thus, this makes it resilient to data heterogeneity and is effective even in non-IID settings. To further improve the accuracy of our detection method, we employ four novel features and capture their anomalies with the joint decisions. Extensive evaluations show that FLTracer achieves an average true positive rate of over $96.88\%$ at an average false positive rate of less than $2.67\%$, significantly outperforming SOTA detection methods. \footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Eyr3/FLTracer}.}

Our approach quantifies each of the two aforementioned indicators by developing their corresponding feature vectors and subsequently computes indicator-specific reference vectors that signify a high risk environment by clustering the data points at the tail-end of an empirical risk spectrum. The proposed framework circumvents the information-theoretic entropy based aggregation methods whose usage varies with different views of entropy that are subjective in nature and more importantly generalizes the notion of risk-valuation using cosine similarity with unknown reference points.

> Sensor technology developments provide a basis for effective fault diagnosis in manufacturing systems. However, the limited number of sensors due to physical constraints or undue costs hinders the accurate diagnosis in the actual process. In addition, time-varying operational conditions that generate nonstationary process faults and the correlation information in the process require to consider for accurate fault diagnosis in the manufacturing systems. This article proposes a novel fault diagnosis method: clustering spatially correlated sparse Bayesian learning (CSSBL), and explicitly demonstrates its applicability in a multistation assembly system that is vulnerable to the above challenges. Specifically, the method is based on a practical assumption that it will likely have a few process faults (sparse). In addition, the hierarchical structure of CSSBL has several parameterized prior distributions to address the above challenges. As posterior distributions of process faults do not have closed form, this paper derives approximate posterior distributions through Variational Bayes inference. The proposed method's efficacy is provided through numerical and real-world case studies utilizing an actual autobody assembly system. The generalizability of the proposed method allows the technique to be applied in fault diagnosis in other domains, including communication and healthcare systems.

> The authentication ceremony plays a crucial role in verifying the identities of users before exchanging messages in end-to-end encryption (E2EE) applications, thus preventing impersonation and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Once authenticated, the subsequent communications in E2EE apps benefit from the protection provided by the authentication ceremony. However, the current implementation of the authentication ceremony in the Zoom application introduces a potential vulnerability that can make it highly susceptible to impersonation attacks. The existence of this vulnerability may undermine the integrity of E2EE, posing a potential security risk when E2EE becomes a mandatory feature in the Zoom application. In this paper, we examine and evaluate this vulnerability in two attack scenarios, one where the attacker is a malicious participant and another where the attacker is a malicious Zoom server with control over Zoom's server infrastructure and cloud providers. Our study aims to comprehensively examine the Zoom authentication ceremony, with a specific focus on the potential for impersonation attacks in static media and textual communications. We simulate a new session injection attack on Zoom E2EE meetings to evaluate the system's susceptibility to simple voice manipulations. Our simulation experiments show that Zoom's authentication ceremony is vulnerable to a simple voice manipulation, called a VOICE-ZEUS attack, by malicious participants and the malicious Zoom server. In this VOICE-ZEUS attack, an attacker creates a fingerprint in a victim's voice by reordering previously recorded digits spoken by the victim. We show how an attacker can record and reorder snippets of digits to generate a new security code that compromises a future Zoom meeting. We conclude that stronger security measures are necessary during the group authentication ceremony in Zoom to prevent impersonation attacks.

> Federated learning allows for clients in a distributed system to jointly train a machine learning model. However, clients' models are vulnerable to attacks during the training and testing phases. In this paper, we address the issue of adversarial clients performing "internal evasion attacks": crafting evasion attacks at test time to deceive other clients. For example, adversaries may aim to deceive spam filters and recommendation systems trained with federated learning for monetary gain. The adversarial clients have extensive information about the victim model in a federated learning setting, as weight information is shared amongst clients. We are the first to characterize the transferability of such internal evasion attacks for different learning methods and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and robustness depending on the degree of similarities in client data. We show that adversarial training defenses in the federated learning setting only display limited improvements against internal attacks. However, combining adversarial training with personalized federated learning frameworks increases relative internal attack robustness by 60% compared to federated adversarial training and performs well under limited system resources.

> Metaverse is trending to create a digital circumstance that can transfer the real world to an online platform supported by large quantities of real-time interactions. Pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are demonstrating their increasing capability in aiding the metaverse to achieve an excellent response with negligible delay, and nowadays, many large models are collaboratively trained by various participants in a manner named collaborative deep learning (CDL). However, several security weaknesses can threaten the safety of the CDL training process, which might result in fatal attacks to either the pre-trained large model or the local sensitive data sets possessed by an individual entity. In CDL, malicious participants can hide within the major innocent and silently uploads deceptive parameters to degenerate the model performance, or they can abuse the downloaded parameters to construct a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to acquire the private information of others illegally. To compensate for these vulnerabilities, this paper proposes an adversary detection-deactivation method, which can limit and isolate the access of potential malicious participants, quarantine and disable the GAN-attack or harmful backpropagation of received threatening gradients. A detailed protection analysis has been conducted on a Multiview CDL case, and results show that the protocol can effectively prevent harmful access by heuristic manner analysis and can protect the existing model by swiftly checking received gradients using only one low-cost branch with an embedded firewall.

> Automated program repair (APR) is a technology that identifies and repairs bugs automatically. However, repairing multi-chunk bugs remains a long-standing and challenging problem because an APR technique must consider dependencies and then reduce the large patch space. In addition, little is known about how to combine individual candidate patches even though multi-chunk bugs require combinations. Therefore, we propose a novel APR technique called multi-code repair (MCRepair), which applies a buggy block, patch optimization, and CodeBERT to target multi-chunk bugs. A buggy block is a novel method that binds buggy chunks into a multi-buggy chunk and preprocesses the chunk with its buggy contexts for patch space reduction and dependency problems. Patch optimization is a novel strategy that effectively combines the generated candidate patches with patch space reduction. In addition, CodeBERT, a BERT for source code datasets, is fine-tuned to address the lack of datasets and out-of-vocabulary problems. We conducted several experiments to evaluate our approach on six project modules of Defects4J. In the experiments using Defects4J, MCRepair repaired 65 bugs, including 21 multi-chunk bugs. Moreover, it fixed 18 unique bugs, including eight multi-chunk bugs, and improved 40 to 250 percent performance than the baselines.

<summary>2023-10-21 12:37:05 - Towards Stable Backdoor Purification through Feature Shift Tuning</summary>

- *Rui Min, Zeyu Qin, Li Shen, Minhao Cheng*

- `2310.01875v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01875v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01875v3)

> It has been widely observed that deep neural networks (DNN) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where attackers could manipulate the model behavior maliciously by tampering with a small set of training samples. Although a line of defense methods is proposed to mitigate this threat, they either require complicated modifications to the training process or heavily rely on the specific model architecture, which makes them hard to deploy into real-world applications. Therefore, in this paper, we instead start with fine-tuning, one of the most common and easy-to-deploy backdoor defenses, through comprehensive evaluations against diverse attack scenarios. Observations made through initial experiments show that in contrast to the promising defensive results on high poisoning rates, vanilla tuning methods completely fail at low poisoning rate scenarios. Our analysis shows that with the low poisoning rate, the entanglement between backdoor and clean features undermines the effect of tuning-based defenses. Therefore, it is necessary to disentangle the backdoor and clean features in order to improve backdoor purification. To address this, we introduce Feature Shift Tuning (FST), a method for tuning-based backdoor purification. Specifically, FST encourages feature shifts by actively deviating the classifier weights from the originally compromised weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FST provides consistently stable performance under different attack settings. Without complex parameter adjustments, FST also achieves much lower tuning costs, only 10 epochs. Our codes are available at https://github.com/AISafety-HKUST/stable_backdoor_purification.

- *Nate Haris, Kendree Chen, Ann Song, Benjamin Pou*

- `2310.14137v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14137v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14137v1)

> Currently, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are becoming increasingly popular to facilitate data transfer in a variety of mobile applications. These APIs often process sensitive user information through their endpoints, which are potentially exploitable due to developer misimplementation. In this paper, a custom, modular endpoint vulnerability detection tool was created and implemented to present current statistics on the degree of information leakage in various mobile Android applications. Our endpoint vulnerability detection tool provided an automated approach to API testing, programmatically modifying requests multiple times using specific information attack methods (IAMs) and heuristically analyzing responses for potentially vulnerable endpoints (PVEs). After analysis of API requests in an encompassing range of applications, findings showed that easily exploitable Broken Access Control (BAC) vulnerabilities of varying severity were common in over 50% of applications. These vulnerabilities ranged from small data leakages due to unintended API use, to full disclosure of sensitive user data, including passwords, names, addresses, and SSNs. This investigation aims to demonstrate the necessity of complete API endpoint security within Android applications, as well as provide an open source example of a modular program which developers could use to test for endpoint vulnerabilities.

<summary>2023-10-22 02:42:52 - Shallow Depth Factoring Based on Quantum Feasibility Labeling and Variational Quantum Search</summary>

- *Imran Khan Tutul, Sara Karimi, Mohammadreza Soltaninia, Junpeng Zhan*

- `2305.19542v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19542v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19542v2)

> Large integer factorization is a prominent research challenge, particularly in the context of quantum computing. This holds significant importance, especially in information security that relies on public key cryptosystems. The classical computation of prime factors for an integer has exponential time complexity. Quantum computing offers the potential for significantly faster computational processes compared to classical processors. In this paper, we propose a new quantum algorithm, Shallow Depth Factoring (SDF), to factor a biprime integer. SDF consists of three steps. First, it converts a factoring problem to an optimization problem without an objective function. Then, it uses a Quantum Feasibility Labeling (QFL) method to label every possible solution according to whether it is feasible or infeasible for the optimization problem. Finally, it employs the Variational Quantum Search (VQS) to find all feasible solutions. The SDF utilizes shallow-depth quantum circuits for efficient factorization, with the circuit depth scaling linearly as the integer to be factorized increases. Through minimizing the number of gates in the circuit, the algorithm enhances feasibility and reduces vulnerability to errors.

> Despite the outstanding performance of deep neural networks, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While there are many invisible attacks in the digital domain, most physical world adversarial attacks are visible. Here we present an invisible optical adversarial attack that uses a light source to dazzle a CMOS camera with a rolling shutter. We present the photopic conditions required to keep the attacking light source completely invisible while sufficiently jamming the captured image so that a deep neural network applied to it is deceived.

> Vertical federated learning (VFL) enables multiple parties with disjoint features of a common user set to train a machine learning model without sharing their private data. Tree-based models have become prevalent in VFL due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, the vulnerability of tree-based VFL has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we first introduce a novel label inference attack, ID2Graph, which utilizes the sets of record IDs assigned to each node (i.e., instance space)to deduce private training labels. ID2Graph attack generates a graph structure from training samples, extracts communities from the graph, and clusters the local dataset using community information. To counteract label leakage from the instance space, we propose two effective defense mechanisms, Grafting-LDP, which improves the utility of label differential privacy with post-processing, and andID-LMID, which focuses on mutual information regularization. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets reveal that ID2Graph presents significant risks to tree-based models such as RandomForest and XGBoost. Further evaluations of these benchmarks demonstrate that our defense methods effectively mitigate label leakage in such instances

- *Kunpeng Zhang, Xiaogang Zhu, Xi Xiao, Minhui Xue, Chao Zhang, Sheng Wen*

- `2308.09239v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09239v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09239v3)

> Mutation-based fuzzing is popular and effective in discovering unseen code and exposing bugs. However, only a few studies have concentrated on quantifying the importance of input bytes, which refers to the degree to which a byte contributes to the discovery of new code. They often focus on obtaining the relationship between input bytes and path constraints, ignoring the fact that not all constraint-related bytes can discover new code. In this paper, we conduct Shapely analysis to understand the effect of byte positions on fuzzing performance, and find that some byte positions contribute more than others and this property often holds across seeds. Based on this observation, we propose a novel fuzzing solution, ShapFuzz, to guide byte selection and mutation. Specifically, ShapFuzz updates Shapley values (importance) of bytes when each input is tested during fuzzing with a low overhead, and utilizes contextual multi-armed bandit to trade off between mutating high Shapley value bytes and low-frequently chosen bytes. We implement a prototype of this solution based on AFL++, i.e., ShapFuzz. We evaluate ShapFuzz against ten state-of-the-art fuzzers, including five byte schedule-reinforced fuzzers and five commonly used fuzzers. Compared with byte schedule-reinforced fuzzers, ShapFuzz discovers more edges and exposes more bugs than the best baseline on three different sets of initial seeds. Compared with commonly used fuzzers, ShapFuzz exposes 20 more bugs than the best comparison fuzzer, and discovers 6 more CVEs than the best baseline on MAGMA. Furthermore, ShapFuzz discovers 11 new bugs on the latest versions of programs, and 3 of them are confirmed by vendors.

> The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread acclaim for their remarkable emerging capabilities. However, the issue of hallucination has parallelly emerged as a by-product, posing significant concerns. While some recent endeavors have been made to identify and mitigate different types of hallucination, there has been a limited emphasis on the nuanced categorization of hallucination and associated mitigation methods. To address this gap, we offer a fine-grained discourse on profiling hallucination based on its degree, orientation, and category, along with offering strategies for alleviation. As such, we define two overarching orientations of hallucination: (i) factual mirage (FM) and (ii) silver lining (SL). To provide a more comprehensive understanding, both orientations are further sub-categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic, with three degrees of severity - (i) mild, (ii) moderate, and (iii) alarming. We also meticulously categorize hallucination into six types: (i) acronym ambiguity, (ii) numeric nuisance, (iii) generated golem, (iv) virtual voice, (v) geographic erratum, and (vi) time wrap. Furthermore, we curate HallucInation eLiciTation (HILT), a publicly available dataset comprising of 75,000 samples generated using 15 contemporary LLMs along with human annotations for the aforementioned categories. Finally, to establish a method for quantifying and to offer a comparative spectrum that allows us to evaluate and rank LLMs based on their vulnerability to producing hallucinations, we propose Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI). We firmly believe that HVI holds significant value as a tool for the wider NLP community, with the potential to serve as a rubric in AI-related policy-making. In conclusion, we propose two solution strategies for mitigating hallucinations.

- `2310.13321v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13321v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13321v2)

> Recent studies have revealed that grammatical error correction methods in the sequence-to-sequence paradigm are vulnerable to adversarial attack, and simply utilizing adversarial examples in the pre-training or post-training process can significantly enhance the robustness of GEC models to certain types of attack without suffering too much performance loss on clean data. In this paper, we further conduct a thorough robustness evaluation of cutting-edge GEC methods for four different types of adversarial attacks and propose a simple yet very effective Cycle Self-Augmenting (CSA) method accordingly. By leveraging the augmenting data from the GEC models themselves in the post-training process and introducing regularization data for cycle training, our proposed method can effectively improve the model robustness of well-trained GEC models with only a few more training epochs as an extra cost. More concretely, further training on the regularization data can prevent the GEC models from over-fitting on easy-to-learn samples and thus can improve the generalization capability and robustness towards unseen data (adversarial noise/samples). Meanwhile, the self-augmented data can provide more high-quality pseudo pairs to improve model performance on the original testing data. Experiments on four benchmark datasets and seven strong models indicate that our proposed training method can significantly enhance the robustness of four types of attacks without using purposely built adversarial examples in training. Evaluation results on clean data further confirm that our proposed CSA method significantly improves the performance of four baselines and yields nearly comparable results with other state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZetangForward/CSA-GEC.

- `2210.16524v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16524v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16524v2)

> Federated clustering (FC) is an extension of centralized clustering in federated settings. The key here is how to construct a global similarity measure without sharing private data, since the local similarity may be insufficient to group local data correctly and the similarity of samples across clients cannot be directly measured due to privacy constraints. Obviously, the most straightforward way to analyze FC is to employ the methods extended from centralized ones, such as K-means (KM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM). However, they are vulnerable to non independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data among clients. To handle this, we propose a new federated clustering framework, named synthetic data aided federated clustering (SDA-FC). It trains generative adversarial network locally in each client and uploads the generated synthetic data to the server, where KM or FCM is performed on the synthetic data. The synthetic data can make the model immune to the non-IID problem and enable us to capture the global similarity characteristics more effectively without sharing private data. Comprehensive experiments reveals the advantages of SDA-FC, including superior performance in addressing the non-IID problem and the device failures.

- *Hui He, Qi Zhang, Shoujin Wang, Kun Yi, Zhendong Niu, Longbing Cao*

- `2301.11535v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11535v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11535v2)

> Performance unfairness among variables widely exists in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting models since such models may attend/bias to certain (advantaged) variables. Addressing this unfairness problem is important for equally attending to all variables and avoiding vulnerable model biases/risks. However, fair MTS forecasting is challenging and has been less studied in the literature. To bridge such significant gap, we formulate the fairness modeling problem as learning informative representations attending to both advantaged and disadvantaged variables. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, named FairFor, for fairness-aware MTS forecasting. FairFor is based on adversarial learning to generate both group-independent and group-relevant representations for the downstream forecasting. The framework first leverages a spectral relaxation of the K-means objective to infer variable correlations and thus to group variables. Then, it utilizes a filtering&fusion component to filter the group-relevant information and generate group-independent representations via orthogonality regularization. The group-independent and group-relevant representations form highly informative representations, facilitating to sharing knowledge from advantaged variables to disadvantaged variables to guarantee fairness. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FairFor for fair forecasting and significant performance improvement.

> Power analysis poses a significant threat to the security of cryptographic algorithms, as it can be leveraged to recover secret keys. While various software-based countermeasures exist to mitigate this non-invasive attack, they often involve a trade-off between time and space constraints. Techniques such as masking and shuffling, while effective, can noticeably impact execution speed and rely heavily on run-time random number generators. On the contrary, internally encoded implementations of block ciphers offer an alternative approach that does not rely on run-time random sources, but it comes with the drawback of requiring substantial memory space to accommodate lookup tables. Internal encoding, commonly employed in white-box cryptography, suffers from a significant security limitation as it does not effectively protect the secret key against statistical analysis. To overcome this weakness, this paper introduces a secure internal encoding method for an AES implementation. By addressing the root cause of vulnerabilities found in previous encoding methods, we propose a balanced encoding technique that aims to minimize the problematic correlation with key-dependent intermediate values. We analyze the potential weaknesses associated with the balanced encoding and present a method that utilizes complementary sets of lookup tables. In this approach, the size of the lookup tables is approximately 512KB, and the number of table lookups is 1,024. This is comparable to the table size of non-protected white-box AES-128 implementations, while requiring only half the number of lookups. By adopting this method, our aim is to introduce a non-masking technique that mitigates the vulnerability to statistical analysis present in current internally-encoded AES implementations.

> Large language models (LLMs) for automatic code generation have achieved breakthroughs in several programming tasks. Their advances in competition-level programming problems have made them an essential pillar of AI-assisted pair programming, and tools such as GitHub Copilot have emerged as part of the daily programming workflow used by millions of developers. The training data for these models is usually collected from the Internet (e.g., from open-source repositories) and is likely to contain faults and security vulnerabilities. This unsanitized training data can cause the language models to learn these vulnerabilities and propagate them during the code generation procedure. While these models have been extensively assessed for their ability to produce functionally correct programs, there remains a lack of comprehensive investigations and benchmarks addressing the security aspects of these models.   In this work, we propose a method to systematically study the security issues of code language models to assess their susceptibility to generating vulnerable code. To this end, we introduce the first approach to automatically find generated code that contains vulnerabilities in black-box code generation models. To achieve this, we present an approach to approximate inversion of the black-box code generation models based on few-shot prompting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by examining code language models in generating high-risk security weaknesses. Furthermore, we establish a collection of diverse non-secure prompts for various vulnerability scenarios using our method. This dataset forms a benchmark for evaluating and comparing the security weaknesses in code language models.

> With the increasing integration of smartphones into our daily lives, fingerphotos are becoming a potential contactless authentication method. While it offers convenience, it is also more vulnerable to spoofing using various presentation attack instruments (PAI). The contactless fingerprint is an emerging biometric authentication but has not yet been heavily investigated for anti-spoofing. While existing anti-spoofing approaches demonstrated fair results, they have encountered challenges in terms of universality and scalability to detect any unseen/unknown spoofed samples. To address this issue, we propose a universal presentation attack detection method for contactless fingerprints, despite having limited knowledge of presentation attack samples. We generated synthetic contactless fingerprints using StyleGAN from live finger photos and integrating them to train a semi-supervised ResNet-18 model. A novel joint loss function, combining the Arcface and Center loss, is introduced with a regularization to balance between the two loss functions and minimize the variations within the live samples while enhancing the inter-class variations between the deepfake and live samples. We also conducted a comprehensive comparison of different regularizations' impact on the joint loss function for presentation attack detection (PAD) and explored the performance of a modified ResNet-18 architecture with different activation functions (i.e., leaky ReLU and RelU) in conjunction with Arcface and center loss. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model using unseen types of spoof attacks and live data. Our proposed method achieves a Bona Fide Classification Error Rate (BPCER) of 0.12\%, an Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER) of 0.63\%, and an Average Classification Error Rate (ACER) of 0.37\%.

> Exploiting the properties of quantum information to the benefit of machine learning models is perhaps the most active field of research in quantum computation. This interest has supported the development of a multitude of software frameworks (e.g. Qiskit, Pennylane, Braket) to implement, simulate, and execute quantum algorithms. Most of them allow us to define quantum circuits, run basic quantum algorithms, and access low-level primitives depending on the hardware such software is supposed to run. For most experiments, these frameworks have to be manually integrated within a larger machine learning software pipeline. The researcher is in charge of knowing different software packages, integrating them through the development of long code scripts, analyzing the results, and generating the plots. Long code often leads to erroneous applications, due to the average number of bugs growing proportional with respect to the program length. Moreover, other researchers will struggle to understand and reproduce the experiment, due to the need to be familiar with all the different software frameworks involved in the code script. We propose QuASK, an open-source quantum machine learning framework written in Python that aids the researcher in performing their experiments, with particular attention to quantum kernel techniques. QuASK can be used as a command-line tool to download datasets, pre-process them, quantum machine learning routines, analyze and visualize the results. QuASK implements most state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze the data through quantum kernels, with the possibility to use projected kernels, (gradient-descent) trainable quantum kernels, and structure-optimized quantum kernels. Our framework can also be used as a library and integrated into pre-existing software, maximizing code reuse.

> A major concern of deep learning models is the large amount of data that is required to build and train them, much of which is reliant on sensitive and personally identifiable information that is vulnerable to access by third parties. Ideas of using the quantum internet to address this issue have been previously proposed, which would enable fast and completely secure online communications. Previous work has yielded a hybrid quantum-classical transfer learning scheme for classical data and communication with a hub-spoke topology. While quantum communication is secure from eavesdrop attacks and no measurements from quantum to classical translation, due to no cloning theorem, hub-spoke topology is not ideal for quantum communication without quantum memory. Here we seek to improve this model by implementing a decentralized ring topology for the federated learning scheme, where each client is given a portion of the entire dataset and only performs training on that set. We also demonstrate the first successful use of quantum weights for quantum federated learning, which allows us to perform our training entirely in quantum.

> Image scaling is an integral part of machine learning and computer vision systems. Unfortunately, this preprocessing step is vulnerable to so-called image-scaling attacks where an attacker makes unnoticeable changes to an image so that it becomes a new image after scaling. This opens up new ways for attackers to control the prediction or to improve poisoning and backdoor attacks. While effective techniques exist to prevent scaling attacks, their detection has not been rigorously studied yet. Consequently, it is currently not possible to reliably spot these attacks in practice.   This paper presents the first in-depth systematization and analysis of detection methods for image-scaling attacks. We identify two general detection paradigms and derive novel methods from them that are simple in design yet significantly outperform previous work. We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in a comprehensive evaluation with all major learning platforms and scaling algorithms. First, we show that image-scaling attacks modifying the entire scaled image can be reliably detected even under an adaptive adversary. Second, we find that our methods provide strong detection performance even if only minor parts of the image are manipulated. As a result, we can introduce a novel protection layer against image-scaling attacks.

> Random Walks-based Anomaly Detection (RWAD) is commonly used to identify anomalous patterns in various applications. An intriguing characteristic of RWAD is that the input graph can either be pre-existing or constructed from raw features. Consequently, there are two potential attack surfaces against RWAD: graph-space attacks and feature-space attacks. In this paper, we explore this vulnerability by designing practical coupled-space attacks, investigating the interplay between graph-space and feature-space attacks. To this end, we conduct a thorough complexity analysis, proving that attacking RWAD is NP-hard. Then, we proceed to formulate the graph-space attack as a bi-level optimization problem and propose two strategies to solve it: alternative iteration (alterI-attack) or utilizing the closed-form solution of the random walk model (cf-attack). Finally, we utilize the results from the graph-space attacks as guidance to design more powerful feature-space attacks (i.e., graph-guided attacks). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed attacks are effective in enabling the target nodes from RWAD with a limited attack budget. In addition, we conduct transfer attack experiments in a black-box setting, which show that our feature attack significantly decreases the anomaly scores of target nodes. Our study opens the door to studying the coupled-space attack against graph anomaly detection in which the graph space relies on the feature space.

> Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been successfully applied in various hypergraph-related tasks due to their excellent higher-order representation capabilities. Recent works have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Most studies on graph adversarial attacks have focused on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and the study of adversarial attacks on HGNNs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we try to reduce this gap. We design a new HGNNs attack model for the untargeted attack, namely MGHGA, which focuses on modifying node features. We consider the process of HGNNs training and use a surrogate model to implement the attack before hypergraph modeling. Specifically, MGHGA consists of two parts: feature selection and feature modification. We use a momentum gradient mechanism to choose the attack node features in the feature selection module. In the feature modification module, we use two feature generation approaches (direct modification and sign gradient) to enable MGHGA to be employed on discrete and continuous datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets to validate the attack performance of MGHGA in the node and the visual object classification tasks. The results show that MGHGA improves performance by an average of 2% compared to the than the baselines.

> Mobile applications have become a ubiquitous part of our daily life, providing users with access to various services and utilities. Text input, as an important interaction channel between users and applications, plays an important role in core functionality such as search queries, authentication, messaging, etc. However, certain special text (e.g., -18 for Font Size) can cause the app to crash, and generating diversified unusual inputs for fully testing the app is highly demanded. Nevertheless, this is also challenging due to the combination of explosion dilemma, high context sensitivity, and complex constraint relations. This paper proposes InputBlaster which leverages the LLM to automatically generate unusual text inputs for mobile app crash detection. It formulates the unusual inputs generation problem as a task of producing a set of test generators, each of which can yield a batch of unusual text inputs under the same mutation rule. In detail, InputBlaster leverages LLM to produce the test generators together with the mutation rules serving as the reasoning chain, and utilizes the in-context learning schema to demonstrate the LLM with examples for boosting the performance. InputBlaster is evaluated on 36 text input widgets with cash bugs involving 31 popular Android apps, and results show that it achieves 78% bug detection rate, with 136% higher than the best baseline. Besides, we integrate it with the automated GUI testing tool and detect 37 unseen crashes in real-world apps from Google Play.

> Recognizing vulnerability is crucial for understanding and implementing targeted support to empower individuals in need. This is especially important at the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), where the court adapts Convention standards to meet actual individual needs and thus ensures effective human rights protection. However, the concept of vulnerability remains elusive at the ECtHR and no prior NLP research has dealt with it. To enable future research in this area, we present VECHR, a novel expert-annotated multi-label dataset comprising of vulnerability type classification and explanation rationale. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art models on VECHR from both prediction and explainability perspectives. Our results demonstrate the challenging nature of the task with lower prediction performance and limited agreement between models and experts. Further, we analyze the robustness of these models in dealing with out-of-domain (OOD) data and observe overall limited performance. Our dataset poses unique challenges offering significant room for improvement regarding performance, explainability, and robustness.

- `2310.15780v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15780v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15780v1)

> Automated Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing plays a crucial role in ensuring app quality, especially as mobile applications have become an integral part of our daily lives. Despite the growing popularity of learning-based techniques in automated GUI testing due to their ability to generate human-like interactions, they still suffer from several limitations, such as low testing coverage, inadequate generalization capabilities, and heavy reliance on training data. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in natural language understanding and question answering, we formulate the mobile GUI testing problem as a Q&A task. We propose GPTDroid, asking LLM to chat with the mobile apps by passing the GUI page information to LLM to elicit testing scripts, and executing them to keep passing the app feedback to LLM, iterating the whole process. Within this framework, we have also introduced a functionality-aware memory prompting mechanism that equips the LLM with the ability to retain testing knowledge of the whole process and conduct long-term, functionality-based reasoning to guide exploration. We evaluate it on 93 apps from Google Play and demonstrate that it outperforms the best baseline by 32% in activity coverage, and detects 31% more bugs at a faster rate. Moreover, GPTDroid identify 53 new bugs on Google Play, of which 35 have been confirmed and fixed.

> Recent applications of LLMs in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) systems have shown impressive results, but the use of shortcuts, mechanisms triggered by features spuriously correlated to the true label, has emerged as a potential threat to their reliability. We analyze the problem from two angles: LLMs as editors, guided to edit text to mislead LLMs; and LLMs as readers, who answer questions based on the edited text. We introduce a framework that guides an editor to add potential shortcuts-triggers to samples. Using GPT4 as the editor, we find it can successfully edit trigger shortcut in samples that fool LLMs. Analysing LLMs as readers, we observe that even capable LLMs can be deceived using shortcut knowledge. Strikingly, we discover that GPT4 can be deceived by its own edits (15% drop in F1). Our findings highlight inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs to shortcut manipulations. We publish ShortcutQA, a curated dataset generated by our framework for future research.

> Modern programming languages like Java require runtime systems to support the implementation and deployment of software applications in diverse computing platforms and operating systems. These runtime systems are normally developed in GitHub-hosted repositories based on close collaboration between large software companies (e.g., IBM, Microsoft) and OSS developers. However, despite their popularity and broad usage; to the best of our knowledge, these repositories have never been studied. We report an empirical study of around 118K issues from 34 runtime system repos in GitHub. We found that issues regarding enhancement, test failure and bug are mostly posted on runtime system repositories and solution related discussion are mostly present on issue discussion. 82.69% issues in the runtime system repositories have been resolved and 0.69% issues are ignored; median of issue close rate, ignore rate and addressing time in these repositories are 76.1%, 2.2% and 58 days respectively. 82.65% issues are tagged with labels while only 28.30% issues have designated assignees and 90.65% issues contain at least one comment; also presence of these features in an issue report can affect issue closure.

> Transformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance in neural machine translation (NMT). However, their vulnerability to noisy input poses a significant challenge in practical implementation, where generating clean output from noisy input is crucial. The MTNT dataset is widely used as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of NMT models against noisy input. Nevertheless, its utility is limited due to the presence of noise in both the source and target sentences. To address this limitation, we focus on cleaning the noise from the target sentences in MTNT, making it more suitable as a benchmark for noise evaluation. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we observe their impressive abilities in noise removal. For example, they can remove emojis while considering their semantic meaning. Additionally, we show that LLM can effectively rephrase slang, jargon, and profanities. The resulting datasets, called C-MTNT, exhibit significantly less noise in the target sentences while preserving the semantic integrity of the original sentences. Our human and GPT-4 evaluations also lead to a consistent conclusion that LLM performs well on this task. Lastly, experiments on C-MTNT showcased its effectiveness in evaluating the robustness of NMT models, highlighting the potential of advanced language models for data cleaning and emphasizing C-MTNT as a valuable resource.

- *Zhuolin Yang, Zain Sarwar, Iris Hwang, Ronik Bhaskar, Ben Y. Zhao, Haitao Zheng*

- `2310.16191v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16191v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16191v1)

> Virtual Reality (VR) has gained popularity by providing immersive and interactive experiences without geographical limitations. It also provides a sense of personal privacy through physical separation. In this paper, we show that despite assumptions of enhanced privacy, VR is unable to shield its users from side-channel attacks that steal private information. Ironically, this vulnerability arises from VR's greatest strength, its immersive and interactive nature. We demonstrate this by designing and implementing a new set of keystroke inference attacks in shared virtual environments, where an attacker (VR user) can recover the content typed by another VR user by observing their avatar. While the avatar displays noisy telemetry of the user's hand motion, an intelligent attacker can use that data to recognize typed keys and reconstruct typed content, without knowing the keyboard layout or gathering labeled data. We evaluate the proposed attacks using IRB-approved user studies across multiple VR scenarios. For 13 out of 15 tested users, our attacks accurately recognize 86%-98% of typed keys, and the recovered content retains up to 98% of the meaning of the original typed content. We also discuss potential defenses.

> In recent years, contrastive learning (CL) has been extensively utilized to recover sentence and document-level encoding capability from pre-trained language models. In this work, we question the length generalizability of CL-based models, i.e., their vulnerability towards length-induced semantic shift. We verify not only that length vulnerability is a significant yet overlooked research gap, but we can devise unsupervised CL methods solely depending on the semantic signal provided by document length. We first derive the theoretical foundations underlying length attacks, showing that elongating a document would intensify the high intra-document similarity that is already brought by CL. Moreover, we found that isotropy promised by CL is highly dependent on the length range of text exposed in training. Inspired by these findings, we introduce a simple yet universal document representation learning framework, LA(SER)$^{3}$: length-agnostic self-reference for semantically robust sentence representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised performance on the standard information retrieval benchmark.

> Large language models (LLMs) have brought significant advancements to code generation, benefiting both novice and experienced developers. However, their training using unsanitized data from open-source repositories, like GitHub, introduces the risk of inadvertently propagating security vulnerabilities. To effectively mitigate this concern, this paper presents a comprehensive study focused on evaluating and enhancing code LLMs from a software security perspective. We introduce SecuCoGen\footnote{SecuCoGen has been uploaded as supplemental material and will be made publicly available after publication.}, a meticulously curated dataset targeting 21 critical vulnerability types. SecuCoGen comprises 180 samples and serves as the foundation for conducting experiments on three crucial code-related tasks: code generation, code repair and vulnerability classification, with a strong emphasis on security. Our experimental results reveal that existing models often overlook security concerns during code generation, leading to the generation of vulnerable code. To address this, we propose effective approaches to mitigate the security vulnerabilities and enhance the overall robustness of code generated by LLMs. Moreover, our study identifies weaknesses in existing models' ability to repair vulnerable code, even when provided with vulnerability information. Additionally, certain vulnerability types pose challenges for the models, hindering their performance in vulnerability classification. Based on these findings, we believe our study will have a positive impact on the software engineering community, inspiring the development of improved methods for training and utilizing LLMs, thereby leading to safer and more trustworthy model deployment.

> Recent studies have revealed that \textit{Backdoor Attacks} can threaten the safety of natural language processing (NLP) models. Investigating the strategies of backdoor attacks will help to understand the model's vulnerability. Most existing textual backdoor attacks focus on generating stealthy triggers or modifying model weights. In this paper, we directly target the interior structure of neural networks and the backdoor mechanism. We propose a novel Trojan Attention Loss (TAL), which enhances the Trojan behavior by directly manipulating the attention patterns. Our loss can be applied to different attacking methods to boost their attack efficacy in terms of attack successful rates and poisoning rates. It applies to not only traditional dirty-label attacks, but also the more challenging clean-label attacks. We validate our method on different backbone models (BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT) and various tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Toxic Detection, and Topic Classification).

> API misuses often lead to software bugs, crashes, and vulnerabilities. While several API misuse detectors have been proposed, there are no automatic repair tools specifically designed for this purpose. In a recent study, test-suite-based automatic program repair (APR) tools were found to be ineffective in repairing API misuses. Still, since the study focused on non-learning-aided APR tools, it remains unknown whether learning-aided APR tools are capable of fixing API misuses. In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have succeeded greatly in many natural language processing tasks. There is a rising interest in applying PLMs to APR. However, there has not been any study that investigates the effectiveness of PLMs in repairing API misuse.   To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on 11 learning-aided APR tools, which include 9 of the state-of-the-art general-purpose PLMs and two APR tools. We evaluate these models with an API-misuse repair dataset, consisting of two variants. Our results show that PLMs perform better than the studied APR tools in repairing API misuses. Among the 9 pre-trained models tested, CodeT5 is the best performer in the exact match. We also offer insights and potential exploration directions for future research.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI) services due to their exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text. LLM chatbots, in particular, have seen widespread adoption, transforming human-machine interactions. However, these LLM chatbots are susceptible to "jailbreak" attacks, where malicious users manipulate prompts to elicit inappropriate or sensitive responses, contravening service policies. Despite existing attempts to mitigate such threats, our research reveals a substantial gap in our understanding of these vulnerabilities, largely due to the undisclosed defensive measures implemented by LLM service providers.   In this paper, we present Jailbreaker, a comprehensive framework that offers an in-depth understanding of jailbreak attacks and countermeasures. Our work makes a dual contribution. First, we propose an innovative methodology inspired by time-based SQL injection techniques to reverse-engineer the defensive strategies of prominent LLM chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing Chat. This time-sensitive approach uncovers intricate details about these services' defenses, facilitating a proof-of-concept attack that successfully bypasses their mechanisms. Second, we introduce an automatic generation method for jailbreak prompts. Leveraging a fine-tuned LLM, we validate the potential of automated jailbreak generation across various commercial LLM chatbots. Our method achieves a promising average success rate of 21.58%, significantly outperforming the effectiveness of existing techniques. We have responsibly disclosed our findings to the concerned service providers, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses. Jailbreaker thus marks a significant step towards understanding and mitigating jailbreak threats in the realm of LLM chatbots.

> Quantum adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that studies the vulnerability of quantum learning systems against adversarial perturbations and develops possible defense strategies. Quantum universal adversarial perturbations are small perturbations, which can make different input samples into adversarial examples that may deceive a given quantum classifier. This is a field that was rarely looked into but worthwhile investigating because universal perturbations might simplify malicious attacks to a large extent, causing unexpected devastation to quantum machine learning models. In this paper, we take a step forward and explore the quantum universal perturbations in the context of heterogeneous classification tasks. In particular, we find that quantum classifiers that achieve almost state-of-the-art accuracy on two different classification tasks can be both conclusively deceived by one carefully-crafted universal perturbation. This result is explicitly demonstrated with well-designed quantum continual learning models with elastic weight consolidation method to avoid catastrophic forgetting, as well as real-life heterogeneous datasets from hand-written digits and medical MRI images. Our results provide a simple and efficient way to generate universal perturbations on heterogeneous classification tasks and thus would provide valuable guidance for future quantum learning technologies.

> Text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion have had a profound impact on daily life by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from textual prompts, fostering creativity, and enhancing visual experiences across various applications. However, these models also pose risks. Previous studies have successfully demonstrated that manipulated prompts can elicit text-to-image models to generate unsafe images, e.g., hateful meme variants. Yet, these studies only unleash the harmful power of text-to-image models in a passive manner. In this work, we focus on the proactive generation of unsafe images using targeted benign prompts via poisoning attacks. We propose two poisoning attacks: a basic attack and a utility-preserving attack. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the proposed attacks using four representative hateful memes and multiple query prompts. Experimental results indicate that text-to-image models are vulnerable to the basic attack even with five poisoning samples. However, the poisoning effect can inadvertently spread to non-targeted prompts, leading to undesirable side effects. Root cause analysis identifies conceptual similarity as an important contributing factor to the side effects. To address this, we introduce the utility-preserving attack as a viable mitigation strategy to maintain the attack stealthiness, while ensuring decent attack performance. Our findings underscore the potential risks of adopting text-to-image models in real-world scenarios, calling for future research and safety measures in this space.

> Collaborative machine learning (ML) is widely used to enable institutions to learn better models from distributed data. While collaborative approaches to learning intuitively protect user data, they remain vulnerable to either the server, the clients, or both, deviating from the protocol. Indeed, because the protocol is asymmetric, a malicious server can abuse its power to reconstruct client data points. Conversely, malicious clients can corrupt learning with malicious updates. Thus, both clients and servers require a guarantee when the other cannot be trusted to fully cooperate. In this work, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) learning scheme that is secure against malicious servers and robust to malicious clients. Our core contribution is a generic framework that transforms any (compatible) algorithm for robust aggregation of model updates to the setting where servers and clients can act maliciously. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of our approach even with 1-million parameter models trained by 100s of peers on standard datasets.

> As the current detection solutions of distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) need additional infrastructures to handle high aggregate data rates, they are not suitable for sensor networks or the Internet of Things. Besides, the security architecture of software-defined sensor networks needs to pay attention to the vulnerabilities of both software-defined networks and sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a network-aware automated machine learning (AutoML) framework which detects DDoS attacks in software-defined sensor networks. Our framework selects an ideal machine learning algorithm to detect DDoS attacks in network-constrained environments, using metrics such as variable traffic load, heterogeneous traffic rate, and detection time while preventing over-fitting. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) we first investigate the trade-off between the efficiency of ML algorithms and network/traffic state in the scope of DDoS detection. (ii) we design and implement a software architecture containing open-source network tools, with the deployment of multiple ML algorithms. Lastly, we show that under the denial of service attacks, our framework ensures the traffic packets are still delivered within the network with additional delays.

> Vision models are often vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples without adapting. While visual prompts offer a lightweight method of input-space adaptation for large-scale vision models, they rely on a high-dimensional additive vector and labeled data. This leads to overfitting when adapting models in a self-supervised test-time setting without labels. We introduce convolutional visual prompts (CVP) for label-free test-time adaptation for robust visual perception. The structured nature of CVP demands fewer trainable parameters, less than 1\% compared to standard visual prompts, combating overfitting. Extensive experiments and analysis on a wide variety of OOD visual perception tasks show that our approach is effective, improving robustness by up to 5.87% over several large-scale models.

> Large language models (LLMs) have recently reached an impressive level of linguistic capability, prompting comparisons with human language skills. However, there have been relatively few systematic inquiries into the linguistic capabilities of the latest generation of LLMs, and those studies that do exist (i) ignore the remarkable ability of humans to generalize, (ii) focus only on English, and (iii) investigate syntax or semantics and overlook other capabilities that lie at the heart of human language, like morphology. Here, we close these gaps by conducting the first rigorous analysis of the morphological capabilities of ChatGPT in four typologically varied languages (specifically, English, German, Tamil, and Turkish). We apply a version of Berko's (1958) wug test to ChatGPT, using novel, uncontaminated datasets for the four examined languages. We find that ChatGPT massively underperforms purpose-built systems, particularly in English. Overall, our results -- through the lens of morphology -- cast a new light on the linguistic capabilities of ChatGPT, suggesting that claims of human-like language skills are premature and misleading.

> Backdoor attacks have emerged as a prominent threat to natural language processing (NLP) models, where the presence of specific triggers in the input can lead poisoned models to misclassify these inputs to predetermined target classes. Current detection mechanisms are limited by their inability to address more covert backdoor strategies, such as style-based attacks. In this work, we propose an innovative test-time poisoned sample detection framework that hinges on the interpretability of model predictions, grounded in the semantic meaning of inputs. We contend that triggers (e.g., infrequent words) are not supposed to fundamentally alter the underlying semantic meanings of poisoned samples as they want to stay stealthy. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that while the model's predictions for paraphrased clean samples should remain stable, predictions for poisoned samples should revert to their true labels upon the mutations applied to triggers during the paraphrasing process. We employ ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art large language model, as our paraphraser and formulate the trigger-removal task as a prompt engineering problem. We adopt fuzzing, a technique commonly used for unearthing software vulnerabilities, to discover optimal paraphrase prompts that can effectively eliminate triggers while concurrently maintaining input semantics. Experiments on 4 types of backdoor attacks, including the subtle style backdoors, and 4 distinct datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods, including STRIP, RAP, and ONION, in precision and recall.

> Modern language models (LMs) have been successfully employed in source code generation and understanding, leading to a significant increase in research focused on learning-based code intelligence, such as automated bug repair, and test case generation. Despite their great potential, language models for code intelligence (LM4Code) are susceptible to potential pitfalls, which hinder realistic performance and further impact their reliability and applicability in real-world deployment. Such challenges drive the need for a comprehensive understanding - not just identifying these issues but delving into their possible implications and existing solutions to build more reliable language models tailored to code intelligence. Based on a well-defined systematic research approach, we conducted an extensive literature review to uncover the pitfalls inherent in LM4Code. Finally, 67 primary studies from top-tier venues have been identified. After carefully examining these studies, we designed a taxonomy of pitfalls in LM4Code research and conducted a systematic study to summarize the issues, implications, current solutions, and challenges of different pitfalls for LM4Code systems. We developed a comprehensive classification scheme that dissects pitfalls across four crucial aspects: data collection and labeling, system design and learning, performance evaluation, and deployment and maintenance. Through this study, we aim to provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners, facilitating their understanding and utilization of LM4Code in reliable and trustworthy ways.

Vulnerabilities in its code could allow attackers to recover sensitive information and take control of the system. This paper describes a case study on formal verification of tpm2-tss using the Frama-C verification platform. Heavily based on linked lists and complex data structures, the library code appears to be highly challenging for the verification tool. We present several issues and limitations we faced, illustrate them with examples and present solutions that allowed us to verify functional properties and the absence of runtime errors for a representative subset of functions. We describe verification results and desired tool improvements necessary to achieve a full formal verification of the target code.

> Designing digital artifacts is not a linear, straightforward process. This is particularly true when applying a user-centered design approach, or co-design, with users who are unable to participate in the design process. Although the reduced participation of a particular user group may harm the end result, the literature on solving this issue is sparse. In this article, proxy design is outlined as a method for involving a user group as proxy users to speak on behalf of a group that is difficult to reach. We present a design ethnography spanning three years at a cancer rehabilitation clinic, where digital artifacts were designed to be used collaboratively by nurses and patients. The empirical data were analyzed using content analysis and consisted of 20 observation days at the clinic, six proxy design workshops, 21 telephone consultations between patients and nurses, and log data from the digital artifact. We show that simulated consultations, with nurses roleplaying as proxies for patients ignited and initiated the design process and enabled an efficient in-depth understanding of patients. Moreover, we reveal how proxy design as a method further expanded the design. We illustrate: (1) proxy design as a method for initiating design, (2) proxy design as an embedded element in co-design and (3) six design guidelines that should be considered when engaging in proxy design. The main contribution is the conceptualization of proxy design as a method that can ignite and initiate the co-design process when important users are unreachable, vulnerable or unable to represent themselves in the co-design process. Based on the empirical findings from a design ethnography that involved nurses as proxy users speaking on behalf of patients, the article shows that roleplaying in proxy design is a fitting way of initiating the design process, outlining proxy design as an embedded element of co-design.

> In computational neuroscience, there has been an increased interest in developing machine learning algorithms that leverage brain imaging data to provide estimates of "brain age" for an individual. Importantly, the discordance between brain age and chronological age (referred to as "brain age gap") can capture accelerated aging due to adverse health conditions and therefore, can reflect increased vulnerability towards neurological disease or cognitive impairments. However, widespread adoption of brain age for clinical decision support has been hindered due to lack of transparency and methodological justifications in most existing brain age prediction algorithms. In this paper, we leverage coVariance neural networks (VNN) to propose an explanation-driven and anatomically interpretable framework for brain age prediction using cortical thickness features. Specifically, our brain age prediction framework extends beyond the coarse metric of brain age gap in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and we make two important observations: (i) VNNs can assign anatomical interpretability to elevated brain age gap in AD by identifying contributing brain regions, (ii) the interpretability offered by VNNs is contingent on their ability to exploit specific eigenvectors of the anatomical covariance matrix. Together, these observations facilitate an explainable and anatomically interpretable perspective to the task of brain age prediction.

> Context: Pre-trained models (PTMs) have demonstrated significant potential in automatic code translation. However, the vulnerability of these models in translation tasks, particularly in terms of syntax, has not been extensively investigated. Objective: To fill this gap, our study aims to propose a novel approach CoTR to assess and improve the syntactic adversarial robustness of PTMs in code translation. Method: CoTR consists of two components: CoTR-A and CoTR-D. CoTR-A generates adversarial examples by transforming programs, while CoTR-D proposes a semantic distance-based sampling data augmentation method and adversarial training method to improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. The Pass@1 metric is used by CoTR to assess the performance of PTMs, which is more suitable for code translation tasks and offers a more precise evaluation in real world scenarios. Results: The effectiveness of CoTR is evaluated through experiments on real world Java to Python datasets. The results demonstrate that CoTR-A can significantly reduce the performance of existing PTMs, while CoTR-D effectively improves the robustness of PTMs. Conclusion: Our study identifies the limitations of current PTMs, including large language models, in code translation tasks. It highlights the potential of CoTR as an effective solution to enhance the robustness of PTMs for code translation tasks.

> Recently efforts have been made by social media platforms as well as researchers to detect hateful or toxic language using large language models. However, none of these works aim to use explanation, additional context and victim community information in the detection process. We utilise different prompt variation, input information and evaluate large language models in zero shot setting (without adding any in-context examples). We select three large language models (GPT-3.5, text-davinci and Flan-T5) and three datasets - HateXplain, implicit hate and ToxicSpans. We find that on average including the target information in the pipeline improves the model performance substantially (~20-30%) over the baseline across the datasets. There is also a considerable effect of adding the rationales/explanations into the pipeline (~10-20%) over the baseline across the datasets. In addition, we further provide a typology of the error cases where these large language models fail to (i) classify and (ii) explain the reason for the decisions they take. Such vulnerable points automatically constitute 'jailbreak' prompts for these models and industry scale safeguard techniques need to be developed to make the models robust against such prompts.

> Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.   In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model.

> Social alignment in AI systems aims to ensure that these models behave according to established societal values. However, unlike humans, who derive consensus on value judgments through social interaction, current language models (LMs) are trained to rigidly replicate their training corpus in isolation, leading to subpar generalization in unfamiliar scenarios and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This work presents a novel training paradigm that permits LMs to learn from simulated social interactions. In comparison to existing methodologies, our approach is considerably more scalable and efficient, demonstrating superior performance in alignment benchmarks and human evaluations. This paradigm shift in the training of LMs brings us a step closer to developing AI systems that can robustly and accurately reflect societal norms and values.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. It is found empirically that adversarially robust generalization is crucial in establishing defense algorithms against adversarial attacks. Therefore, it is interesting to study the theoretical guarantee of robust generalization. This paper focuses on norm-based complexity, based on a PAC-Bayes approach (Neyshabur et al., 2017). The main challenge lies in extending the key ingredient, which is a weight perturbation bound in standard settings, to the robust settings. Existing attempts heavily rely on additional strong assumptions, leading to loose bounds. In this paper, we address this issue and provide a spectrally-normalized robust generalization bound for DNNs. Compared to existing bounds, our bound offers two significant advantages: Firstly, it does not depend on additional assumptions. Secondly, it is considerably tighter, aligning with the bounds of standard generalization. Therefore, our result provides a different perspective on understanding robust generalization: The mismatch terms between standard and robust generalization bounds shown in previous studies do not contribute to the poor robust generalization. Instead, these disparities solely due to mathematical issues. Finally, we extend the main result to adversarial robustness against general non-$\ell_p$ attacks and other neural network architectures.

> The growing adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled energy smart appliances (ESAs) at the consumer end, such as smart heat pumps, electric vehicle chargers, etc., is seen as key to enabling demand-side response (DSR) services. However, these smart appliances are often poorly engineered from a security point of view and present a new threat to power grid operations. They may become convenient entry points for malicious parties to gain access to the system and disrupt important grid operations by abruptly changing the demand. Unlike utility-side and SCADA assets, ESAs are not monitored continuously due to their large numbers and the lack of extensive monitoring infrastructure at consumer sites. This article presents an in-depth analysis of the demand side threats to power grid operations including (i) an overview of the vulnerabilities in ESAs and the wider risk from the DSR ecosystem and (ii) key factors influencing the attack impact on power grid operations. Finally, it presents measures to improve the cyber-physical resilience of power grids, putting them in the context of ongoing efforts from the industry and regulatory bodies worldwide.

> Despite the remarkable success achieved by deep learning algorithms in various domains, such as computer vision, they remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Adversarial Training (AT) stands out as one of the most effective solutions to address this issue; however, single-step AT can lead to Catastrophic Overfitting (CO). This scenario occurs when the adversarially trained network suddenly loses robustness against multi-step attacks like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Although several approaches have been proposed to address this problem in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we found out that they do not perform well when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we propose Blacksmith, a novel training strategy to overcome the CO problem, specifically in ViTs. Our approach utilizes either of PGD-2 or Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) randomly in a mini-batch during the adversarial training of the neural network. This will increase the diversity of our training attacks, which could potentially mitigate the CO issue. To manage the increased training time resulting from this combination, we craft the PGD-2 attack based on only the first half of the layers, while FGSM is applied end-to-end. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our novel method effectively prevents CO, achieves PGD-2 level performance, and outperforms other existing techniques including N-FGSM, which is the state-of-the-art method in fast training for CNNs.

> Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved unprecedented performance in response generation, especially with visual inputs, enabling more creative and adaptable interaction than large language models such as ChatGPT. Nonetheless, multimodal generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable modality (e.g., vision). To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of open-source large VLMs in the most realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning the targeted responses. In particular, we first craft targeted adversarial examples against pretrained models such as CLIP and BLIP, and then transfer these adversarial examples to other VLMs such as MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, UniDiffuser, BLIP-2, and Img2Prompt. In addition, we observe that black-box queries on these VLMs can further improve the effectiveness of targeted evasion, resulting in a surprisingly high success rate for generating targeted responses. Our findings provide a quantitative understanding regarding the adversarial vulnerability of large VLMs and call for a more thorough examination of their potential security flaws before deployment in practice.

> Machine learning models are famously vulnerable to adversarial attacks: small ad-hoc perturbations of the data that can catastrophically alter the model predictions. While a large literature has studied the case of test-time attacks on pre-trained models, the important case of attacks in an online learning setting has received little attention so far. In this work, we use a control-theoretical perspective to study the scenario where an attacker may perturb data labels to manipulate the learning dynamics of an online learner. We perform a theoretical analysis of the problem in a teacher-student setup, considering different attack strategies, and obtaining analytical results for the steady state of simple linear learners. These results enable us to prove that a discontinuous transition in the learner's accuracy occurs when the attack strength exceeds a critical threshold. We then study empirically attacks on learners with complex architectures using real data, confirming the insights of our theoretical analysis. Our findings show that greedy attacks can be extremely efficient, especially when data stream in small batches.

> Dense retrievers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks, but to what extent can they be safely deployed in real-world applications? In this work, we propose a novel attack for dense retrieval systems in which a malicious user generates a small number of adversarial passages by perturbing discrete tokens to maximize similarity with a provided set of training queries. When these adversarial passages are inserted into a large retrieval corpus, we show that this attack is highly effective in fooling these systems to retrieve them for queries that were not seen by the attacker. More surprisingly, these adversarial passages can directly generalize to out-of-domain queries and corpora with a high success attack rate -- for instance, we find that 50 generated passages optimized on Natural Questions can mislead >94% of questions posed in financial documents or online forums. We also benchmark and compare a range of state-of-the-art dense retrievers, both unsupervised and supervised. Although different systems exhibit varying levels of vulnerability, we show they can all be successfully attacked by injecting up to 500 passages, a small fraction compared to a retrieval corpus of millions of passages.

> Many fine-grained classification tasks, like rare animal identification, have limited training data and consequently classifiers trained on these datasets often fail to generalize to variations in the domain like changes in weather or location. As such, we explore how natural language descriptions of the domains seen in training data can be used with large vision models trained on diverse pretraining datasets to generate useful variations of the training data. We introduce ALIA (Automated Language-guided Image Augmentation), a method which utilizes large vision and language models to automatically generate natural language descriptions of a dataset's domains and augment the training data via language-guided image editing. To maintain data integrity, a model trained on the original dataset filters out minimal image edits and those which corrupt class-relevant information. The resulting dataset is visually consistent with the original training data and offers significantly enhanced diversity. We show that ALIA is able to surpasses traditional data augmentation and text-to-image generated data on fine-grained classification tasks, including cases of domain generalization and contextual bias.

> Federated learning (FL) aims at keeping client data local to preserve privacy. Instead of gathering the data itself, the server only collects aggregated gradient updates from clients. Following the popularity of FL, there has been considerable amount of work, revealing the vulnerability of FL approaches by reconstructing the input data from gradient updates. Yet, most existing works assume an FL setting with unrealistically small batch size, and have poor image quality when the batch size is large. Other works modify the neural network architectures or parameters to the point of being suspicious, and thus, can be detected by clients. Moreover, most of them can only reconstruct one sample input from a large batch. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and completely analytical approach, referred to as the maximum knowledge orthogonality reconstruction (MKOR), to reconstruct clients' input data. Our proposed method reconstructs a mathematically proven high quality image from large batches. MKOR only requires the server to send secretly modified parameters to clients and can efficiently and inconspicuously reconstruct the input images from clients' gradient updates. We evaluate MKOR's performance on the MNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet dataset and compare it with the state-of-the-art works. The results show that MKOR outperforms the existing approaches, and draws attention to a pressing need for further research on the privacy protection of FL so that comprehensive defense approaches can be developed.

> The widespread deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) sparks significant interest in their explainability, which plays a vital role in model auditing and ensuring trustworthy graph learning. The objective of GNN explainability is to discern the underlying graph structures that have the most significant impact on model predictions. Ensuring that explanations generated are reliable necessitates consideration of the in-distribution property, particularly due to the vulnerability of GNNs to out-of-distribution data. Unfortunately, prevailing explainability methods tend to constrain the generated explanations to the structure of the original graph, thereby downplaying the significance of the in-distribution property and resulting in explanations that lack reliability. To address these challenges, we propose D4Explainer, a novel approach that provides in-distribution GNN explanations for both counterfactual and model-level explanation scenarios. The proposed D4Explainer incorporates generative graph distribution learning into the optimization objective, which accomplishes two goals: 1) generate a collection of diverse counterfactual graphs that conform to the in-distribution property for a given instance, and 2) identify the most discriminative graph patterns that contribute to a specific class prediction, thus serving as model-level explanations. It is worth mentioning that D4Explainer is the first unified framework that combines both counterfactual and model-level explanations. Empirical evaluations conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets provide compelling evidence of the state-of-the-art performance achieved by D4Explainer in terms of explanation accuracy, faithfulness, diversity, and robustness.

> Generative models have demonstrated revolutionary success in various visual creation tasks, but in the meantime, they have been exposed to the threat of leaking private information of their training data. Several membership inference attacks (MIAs) have been proposed to exhibit the privacy vulnerability of generative models by classifying a query image as a training dataset member or nonmember. However, these attacks suffer from major limitations, such as requiring shadow models and white-box access, and either ignoring or only focusing on the unique property of diffusion models, which block their generalization to multiple generative models. In contrast, we propose the first generalized membership inference attack against a variety of generative models such as generative adversarial networks, [variational] autoencoders, implicit functions, and the emerging diffusion models. We leverage only generated distributions from target generators and auxiliary non-member datasets, therefore regarding target generators as black boxes and agnostic to their architectures or application scenarios. Experiments validate that all the generative models are vulnerable to our attack. For instance, our work achieves attack AUC $>0.99$ against DDPM, DDIM, and FastDPM trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA. And the attack against VQGAN, LDM (for the text-conditional generation), and LIIF achieves AUC $>0.90.$ As a result, we appeal to our community to be aware of such privacy leakage risks when designing and publishing generative models.

> Semantic communication has emerged as a new deep learning-based communication paradigm that drives the research of end-to-end data transmission in tasks like image classification, and image reconstruction. However, the security problem caused by semantic attacks has not been well explored, resulting in vulnerabilities within semantic communication systems exposed to potential semantic perturbations. In this paper, we propose a secure semantic communication system, DiffuSeC, which leverages the diffusion model and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address this issue. With the diffusing module in the sender end and the asymmetric denoising module in the receiver end, the DiffuSeC mitigates the perturbations added by semantic attacks, including data source attacks and channel attacks. To further improve the robustness under unstable channel conditions caused by semantic attacks, we developed a DRL-based channel-adaptive diffusion step selection scheme to achieve stable performance under fluctuating environments. A timestep synchronization scheme is designed for diffusion timestep coordination between the two ends. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DiffuSeC shows higher robust accuracy than previous works under a wide range of channel conditions, and can quickly adjust the model state according to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in unstable environments.

> In today's world, secure and efficient biometric authentication is of keen importance. Traditional authentication methods are no longer considered reliable due to their susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Biometric authentication, particularly fingerprint authentication, has emerged as a promising alternative, but it raises concerns about the storage and use of biometric data, as well as centralized storage, which could make it vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper, a novel blockchain-based fingerprint authentication system is proposed that integrates zk-SNARKs, which are zero-knowledge proofs that enable secure and efficient authentication without revealing sensitive biometric information. A KNN-based approach on the FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 datasets is used to generate a cancelable template for secure, faster, and robust biometric registration and authentication which is stored using the Interplanetary File System. The proposed approach provides an average accuracy of 99.01%, 98.97% and 98.52% over the FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 datasets respectively for fingerprint authentication. Incorporation of zk-SNARK facilitates smaller proof size. Overall, the proposed method has the potential to provide a secure and efficient solution for blockchain-based identity management.

> Machine learning (ML) technologies are known to be riddled with ethical and operational problems, however, we are witnessing an increasing thrust by businesses to deploy them in sensitive applications. One major issue among many is that ML models do not perform equally well for underrepresented groups. This puts vulnerable populations in an even disadvantaged and unfavorable position. We propose an approach that leverages the power of web search and generative models to alleviate some of the shortcomings of discriminative models. We demonstrate our method on an image classification problem using ImageNet's People Subtree subset, and show that it is effective in enhancing robustness and mitigating bias in certain classes that represent vulnerable populations (e.g., female doctor of color). Our new method is able to (1) identify weak decision boundaries for such classes; (2) construct search queries for Google as well as text for generating images through DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion; and (3) show how these newly captured training samples could alleviate population bias issue. While still improving the model's overall performance considerably, we achieve a significant reduction (77.30\%) in the model's gender accuracy disparity. In addition to these improvements, we observed a notable enhancement in the classifier's decision boundary, as it is characterized by fewer weakspots and an increased separation between classes. Although we showcase our method on vulnerable populations in this study, the proposed technique is extendable to a wide range of problems and domains.

> Vulnerability identification is crucial to protect software systems from attacks for cyber-security. However, huge projects have more than millions of lines of code, and the complex dependencies make it hard to carry out traditional static and dynamic methods. Furthermore, the semantic structure of various types of vulnerabilities differs greatly and may occur simultaneously, making general rule-based methods difficult to extend. In this paper, we propose \textit{Vignat}, a novel attention-based framework for identifying vulnerabilities by learning graph-level semantic representations of code. We represent codes with code property graphs (CPGs) in fine grain and use graph attention networks (GATs) for vulnerability detection. The results show that Vignat is able to achieve $57.38\%$ accuracy on reliable datasets derived from popular C libraries. Furthermore, the interpretability of our GATs provides valuable insights into vulnerability patterns.

> Static and dynamic computational graphs represent two distinct approaches to constructing deep learning frameworks. The former prioritizes compiler-based optimizations, while the latter focuses on programmability and user-friendliness. The recent release of PyTorch 2.0, which supports compiling arbitrary deep learning programs in Python, signifies a new direction in the evolution of deep learning infrastructure to incorporate compiler techniques in a more dynamic manner and support more dynamic language features like dynamic control flows and closures. Given PyTorch's seamless integration with Python, its compiler aims to support arbitrary deep learning code written in Python. However, the inherent dynamism of Python poses challenges to the completeness and robustness of the compiler. While recent research has introduced fuzzing to test deep learning compilers, there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis on how to test dynamic features. To address this issue, we propose several code transformations to generate test cases involving dynamic features. These transformations preserve the program's semantics, ensuring that any discrepancy between the transformed and original programs indicates the presence of a bug. Through our approach, we have successfully identified twenty previously unknown bugs in the PyTorch compiler and its underlying tensor compiler Triton.

> In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness of multi-exit language models against adversarial slowdown. To audit their robustness, we design a slowdown attack that generates natural adversarial text bypassing early-exit points. We use the resulting WAFFLE attack as a vehicle to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three multi-exit mechanisms with the GLUE benchmark against adversarial slowdown. We then show our attack significantly reduces the computational savings provided by the three methods in both white-box and black-box settings. The more complex a mechanism is, the more vulnerable it is to adversarial slowdown. We also perform a linguistic analysis of the perturbed text inputs, identifying common perturbation patterns that our attack generates, and comparing them with standard adversarial text attacks. Moreover, we show that adversarial training is ineffective in defeating our slowdown attack, but input sanitization with a conversational model, e.g., ChatGPT, can remove perturbations effectively. This result suggests that future work is needed for developing efficient yet robust multi-exit models. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ztcoalson/WAFFLE

For testing quality, we propose a method that specifies generalized coverage criteria over sequences of actions, which extends previous approaches. Our publicly available tool demonstrates how to extract effective test suites from test plans based on these criteria. We also present a Bayesian approach for measuring the probabilities of bugs or risks, and show how this quantification can help achieve an informed balance between exploitation and exploration in testing. Finally, we provide an empirical evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our tool in finding bugs, assessing risks, and achieving coverage.

> In this work, we study the implications of the implicit bias of gradient flow on generalization and adversarial robustness in ReLU networks. We focus on a setting where the data consists of clusters and the correlations between cluster means are small, and show that in two-layer ReLU networks gradient flow is biased towards solutions that generalize well, but are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Our results hold even in cases where the network has many more parameters than training examples. Despite the potential for harmful overfitting in such overparameterized settings, we prove that the implicit bias of gradient flow prevents it. However, the implicit bias also leads to non-robust solutions (susceptible to small adversarial $\ell_2$-perturbations), even though robust networks that fit the data exist.

> Widely-used LiDAR-based 3D object detectors often neglect fundamental geometric information readily available from the object proposals in their confidence estimation. This is mostly due to architectural design choices, which were often adopted from the 2D image domain, where geometric context is rarely available. In 3D, however, considering the object properties and its surroundings in a holistic way is important to distinguish between true and false positive detections, e.g. occluded pedestrians in a group. To address this, we present GACE, an intuitive and highly efficient method to improve the confidence estimation of a given black-box 3D object detector. We aggregate geometric cues of detections and their spatial relationships, which enables us to properly assess their plausibility and consequently, improve the confidence estimation. This leads to consistent performance gains over a variety of state-of-the-art detectors. Across all evaluated detectors, GACE proves to be especially beneficial for the vulnerable road user classes, i.e. pedestrians and cyclists.

> Training computer-vision related algorithms on medical images for disease diagnosis or image segmentation is difficult in large part due to privacy concerns. For this reason, generative image models are highly sought after to facilitate data sharing. However, 3-D generative models are understudied, and investigation of their privacy leakage is needed. We introduce our 3-D generative model, Transversal GAN (TrGAN), using head & neck PET images which are conditioned on tumour masks as a case study. We define quantitative measures of image fidelity, utility and privacy for our model. These metrics are evaluated in the course of training to identify ideal fidelity, utility and privacy trade-offs and establish the relationships between these parameters. We show that the discriminator of the TrGAN is vulnerable to attack, and that an attacker can identify which samples were used in training with almost perfect accuracy (AUC = 0.99). We also show that an attacker with access to only the generator cannot reliably classify whether a sample had been used for training (AUC = 0.51). This suggests that TrGAN generators, but not discriminators, may be used for sharing synthetic 3-D PET data with minimal privacy risk while maintaining good utility and fidelity.

> Large Language Models' safety remains a critical concern due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which can prompt these systems to produce harmful responses. In the heart of these systems lies a safety classifier, a computational model trained to discern and mitigate potentially harmful, offensive, or unethical outputs. However, contemporary safety classifiers, despite their potential, often fail when exposed to inputs infused with adversarial noise. In response, our study introduces the Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS), a lightweight model that excels in detection accuracy and demonstrates resilience against adversarial prompts. Additionally, we propose novel strategies for autonomously generating adversarial training datasets, named Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) datasets. These datasets are designed to fortify the safety classifier's robustness, and we investigate the consequences of incorporating adversarial examples into the training process. Through evaluations involving Large Language Models, we demonstrate that our classifier has the potential to decrease the attack success rate resulting from adversarial attacks by up to 60%. This advancement paves the way for the next generation of more reliable and resilient conversational agents.

> Distributional robustness is a promising framework for training deep learning models that are less vulnerable to adversarial examples and data distribution shifts. Previous works have mainly focused on exploiting distributional robustness in the data space. In this work, we explore an optimal transport-based distributional robustness framework in model spaces. Specifically, we examine a model distribution within a Wasserstein ball centered on a given model distribution that maximizes the loss. We have developed theories that enable us to learn the optimal robust center model distribution. Interestingly, our developed theories allow us to flexibly incorporate the concept of sharpness awareness into training, whether it's a single model, ensemble models, or Bayesian Neural Networks, by considering specific forms of the center model distribution. These forms include a Dirac delta distribution over a single model, a uniform distribution over several models, and a general Bayesian Neural Network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a specific case of our framework when using a Dirac delta distribution over a single model, while our framework can be seen as a probabilistic extension of SAM. To validate the effectiveness of our framework in the aforementioned settings, we conducted extensive experiments, and the results reveal remarkable improvements compared to the baselines.

> Automated program repair (APR) aims to fix software bugs automatically and plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. With the recent advances in deep learning (DL), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed to leverage neural networks to learn bug-fixing patterns from massive open-source code repositories. Such learning-based techniques usually treat APR as a neural machine translation (NMT) task, where buggy code snippets (i.e., source language) are translated into fixed code snippets (i.e., target language) automatically. Benefiting from the powerful capability of DL to learn hidden relationships from previous bug-fixing datasets, learning-based APR techniques have achieved remarkable performance. In this paper, we provide a systematic survey to summarize the current state-of-the-art research in the learning-based APR community. We illustrate the general workflow of learning-based APR techniques and detail the crucial components, including fault localization, patch generation, patch ranking, patch validation, and patch correctness phases. We then discuss the widely-adopted datasets and evaluation metrics and outline existing empirical studies. We discuss several critical aspects of learning-based APR techniques, such as repair domains, industrial deployment, and the open science issue. We highlight several practical guidelines on applying DL techniques for future APR studies, such as exploring explainable patch generation and utilizing code features. Overall, our paper can help researchers gain a comprehensive understanding about the achievements of the existing learning-based APR techniques and promote the practical application of these techniques.

> While multi-exit neural networks are regarded as a promising solution for making efficient inference via early exits, combating adversarial attacks remains a challenging problem. In multi-exit networks, due to the high dependency among different submodels, an adversarial example targeting a specific exit not only degrades the performance of the target exit but also reduces the performance of all other exits concurrently. This makes multi-exit networks highly vulnerable to simple adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose NEO-KD, a knowledge-distillation-based adversarial training strategy that tackles this fundamental challenge based on two key contributions. NEO-KD first resorts to neighbor knowledge distillation to guide the output of the adversarial examples to tend to the ensemble outputs of neighbor exits of clean data. NEO-KD also employs exit-wise orthogonal knowledge distillation for reducing adversarial transferability across different submodels. The result is a significantly improved robustness against adversarial attacks. Experimental results on various datasets/models show that our method achieves the best adversarial accuracy with reduced computation budgets, compared to the baselines relying on existing adversarial training or knowledge distillation techniques for multi-exit networks.

> Vision Transformer (ViT) has demonstrated promising performance in computer vision tasks, comparable to state-of-the-art neural networks. Yet, this new type of deep neural network architecture is vulnerable to adversarial attacks limiting its capabilities in terms of robustness. This article presents a novel contribution aimed at further improving the accuracy and robustness of ViT, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks. We propose an augmentation technique called `Dynamic Scanning Augmentation' that leverages dynamic input sequences to adaptively focus on different patches, thereby maintaining performance and robustness. Our detailed investigations reveal that this adaptability to the input sequence induces significant changes in the attention mechanism of ViT, even for the same image. We introduce four variations of Dynamic Scanning Augmentation, outperforming ViT in terms of both robustness to adversarial attacks and accuracy against natural images, with one variant showing comparable results. By integrating our augmentation technique, we observe a substantial increase in ViT's robustness, improving it from $17\%$ to $92\%$ measured across different types of adversarial attacks. These findings, together with other comprehensive tests, indicate that Dynamic Scanning Augmentation enhances accuracy and robustness by promoting a more adaptive type of attention. In conclusion, this work contributes to the ongoing research on Vision Transformers by introducing Dynamic Scanning Augmentation as a technique for improving the accuracy and robustness of ViT. The observed results highlight the potential of this approach in advancing computer vision tasks and merit further exploration in future studies.

> In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape and advanced software development, the rise in cyber security attacks has become a pressing concern. The integration of robust cyber security defenses has become essential across all phases of software development. It holds particular significance in identifying critical cyber security vulnerabilities at the initial stages of the software development life cycle, notably during the requirement phase. Through the utilization of cyber security repositories like The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) from MITRE and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases, attempts have been made to leverage topic modeling and machine learning for the detection of these early-stage vulnerabilities in the software requirements process. Past research themes have returned successful outcomes in attempting to automate vulnerability identification for software developers, employing a mixture of unsupervised machine learning methodologies such as LDA and topic modeling. Looking ahead, in our pursuit to improve automation and establish connections between software requirements and vulnerabilities, our strategy entails adopting a variety of supervised machine learning techniques. This array encompasses Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na\"ive Bayes, random forest, neural networking and eventually transitioning into deep learning for our investigation. In the face of the escalating complexity of cyber security, the question of whether machine learning can enhance the identification of vulnerabilities in diverse software development scenarios is a paramount consideration, offering crucial assistance to software developers in developing secure software.

> Despite the increasing popularity of policy gradient methods, they are yet to be widely utilized in sample-scarce applications, such as robotics. The sample efficiency could be improved by making best usage of available information. As a key component in reinforcement learning, the reward function is usually devised carefully to guide the agent. Hence, the reward function is usually known, allowing access to not only scalar reward signals but also reward gradients. To benefit from reward gradients, previous works require the knowledge of environment dynamics, which are hard to obtain. In this work, we develop the \textit{Reward Policy Gradient} estimator, a novel approach that integrates reward gradients without learning a model. Bypassing the model dynamics allows our estimator to achieve a better bias-variance trade-off, which results in a higher sample efficiency, as shown in the empirical analysis. Our method also boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization on different MuJoCo control tasks.

> Visual question answering (VQA) models are designed to demonstrate visual-textual reasoning capabilities. However, their real-world applicability is hindered by a lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets. Existing domain generalization datasets for VQA exhibit a unilateral focus on textual shifts while VQA being a multi-modal task contains shifts across both visual and textual domains. We propose VQA-GEN, the first ever multi-modal benchmark dataset for distribution shift generated through a shift induced pipeline. Experiments demonstrate VQA-GEN dataset exposes the vulnerability of existing methods to joint multi-modal distribution shifts. validating that comprehensive multi-modal shifts are critical for robust VQA generalization. Models trained on VQA-GEN exhibit improved cross-domain and in-domain performance, confirming the value of VQA-GEN. Further, we analyze the importance of each shift technique of our pipeline contributing to the generalization of the model.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong natural language processing and code synthesis capabilities, which has led to their rapid adoption in software engineering applications. However, details about LLM training data are often not made public, which has caused concern as to whether existing bug benchmarks are included. In lieu of the training data for the popular GPT models, we examine the training data of the open-source LLM StarCoder, and find it likely that data from the widely used Defects4J benchmark was included, raising the possibility of its inclusion in GPT training data as well. This makes it difficult to tell how well LLM-based results on Defects4J would generalize, as for any results it would be unclear whether a technique's performance is due to LLM generalization or memorization. To remedy this issue and facilitate continued research on LLM-based SE, we present the GitHub Recent Bugs (GHRB) dataset, which includes 76 real-world Java bugs that were gathered after the OpenAI data cut-off point.

> Memory safety is a cornerstone of secure and robust software systems, as it prevents a wide range of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques. Among these, we focus on Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). ROP works as such: the attacker takes control of the program's execution flow via a memory corruption attack, then takes advantages of code snippets already in the program's memory, dubbed "gadgets," to achieve the attacker's desired effect.   In this paper, we introduce SafeLLVM, an approach to minimize the number of gadgets in x86-64 binaries compiled with the LLVM infrastructure. Building upon the techniques outlined in previous works, we implement a series of passes within the LLVM compiler's backend to minimize the number of gadgets present and thus prevent ROP attacks. We evaluated our approach by compiling a number of real-world applications, including cJSON, zlib, curl, and mimalloc. The results show our solution is able to prevent any form of ROP on the binaries compiled with SafeLLVM while maintaining the same functionality as the original binaries.

> Physical adversarial attacks on road signs are continuously exploiting vulnerabilities in modern day autonomous vehicles (AVs) and impeding their ability to correctly classify what type of road sign they encounter. Current models cannot generalize input data well, resulting in overfitting or underfitting. In overfitting, the model memorizes the input data but cannot generalize to new scenarios. In underfitting, the model does not learn enough of the input data to accurately classify these road signs. This paper explores the resilience of autonomous driving systems against three main physical adversarial attacks (tape, graffiti, illumination), specifically targeting object classifiers. Several machine learning models were developed and evaluated on two distinct datasets: road signs (stop signs, speed limit signs, traffic lights, and pedestrian crosswalk signs) and geometric shapes (octagons, circles, squares, and triangles). The study compared algorithm performance under different conditions, including clean and adversarial training and testing on these datasets. To build robustness against attacks, defense techniques like adversarial training and transfer learning were implemented. Results demonstrated transfer learning models played a crucial role in performance by allowing knowledge gained from shape training to improve generalizability of road sign classification, despite the datasets being completely different. The paper suggests future research directions, including human-in-the-loop validation, security analysis, real-world testing, and explainable AI for transparency. This study aims to contribute to improving security and robustness of object classifiers in autonomous vehicles and mitigating adversarial example impacts on driving systems.

> With the increasing popularity of graph neural networks (GNNs) in several sensitive applications like healthcare and medicine, concerns have been raised over the privacy aspects of trained GNNs. More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only black-box access to the trained model is granted. We propose PrivGNN, a privacy-preserving framework for releasing GNN models in a centralized setting. Assuming an access to a public unlabeled graph, PrivGNN provides a framework to release GNN models trained explicitly on public data along with knowledge obtained from the private data in a privacy preserving manner. PrivGNN combines the knowledge-distillation framework with the two noise mechanisms, random subsampling, and noisy labeling, to ensure rigorous privacy guarantees. We theoretically analyze our approach in the Renyi differential privacy framework. Besides, we show the solid experimental performance of our method compared to several baselines adapted for graph-structured data. Our code is available at https://github.com/iyempissy/privGnn.

> While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks: malicious third party prompts that subvert the intent of the system designer. To help researchers study this problem, we present a dataset of over 126,000 prompt injection attacks and 46,000 prompt-based "defenses" against prompt injection, all created by players of an online game called Tensor Trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest dataset of human-generated adversarial examples for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in our dataset have a lot of easily interpretable stucture, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. We also use the dataset to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection, which we refer to as prompt extraction and prompt hijacking. Our benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, we show that some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game.

> As organizations increasingly use cloud services to host their IT infrastructure, there is a need to share data among these cloud hosted services and systems. A majority of IT organizations have workloads spread across different cloud service providers, growing their multi-cloud environments. When an organization grows their multi-cloud environment, the threat vectors and vulnerabilities for their cloud systems and services grow as well. The increase in the number of attack vectors creates a challenge of how to prioritize mitigations and countermeasures to best defend a multi-cloud environment against attacks. Utilizing multiple industry standard risk analysis tools, we conducted an analysis of multi-cloud threat vectors enabling calculation and prioritization for the identified mitigations and countermeasures. The prioritizations from the analysis showed that authentication and architecture are the highest risk areas of threat vectors. Armed with this data, IT managers are able to more appropriately budget cybersecurity expenditure to implement the most impactful mitigations and countermeasures.

> The adversarial vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has drawn great attention due to the security risk of applying these models in real-world applications. Based on transferability of adversarial examples, an increasing number of transfer-based methods have been developed to fool black-box DNN models whose architecture and parameters are inaccessible. Although tremendous effort has been exerted, there still lacks a standardized benchmark that could be taken advantage of to compare these methods systematically, fairly, and practically. Our investigation shows that the evaluation of some methods needs to be more reasonable and more thorough to verify their effectiveness, to avoid, for example, unfair comparison and insufficient consideration of possible substitute/victim models. Therefore, we establish a transfer-based attack benchmark (TA-Bench) which implements 30+ methods. In this paper, we evaluate and compare them comprehensively on 25 popular substitute/victim models on ImageNet. New insights about the effectiveness of these methods are gained and guidelines for future evaluations are provided. Code at: https://github.com/qizhangli/TA-Bench.

- `2311.01532v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01532v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01532v1)

> Security advisories are the primary channel of communication for discovered vulnerabilities in open-source software, but they often lack crucial information. Specifically, 63% of vulnerability database reports are missing their patch links, also referred to as vulnerability fixing commits (VFCs). This paper introduces VFCFinder, a tool that generates the top-five ranked set of VFCs for a given security advisory using Natural Language Programming Language (NL-PL) models. VFCFinder yields a 96.6% recall for finding the correct VFC within the Top-5 commits, and an 80.0% recall for the Top-1 ranked commit. VFCFinder generalizes to nine different programming languages and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 36 percentage points in terms of Top-1 recall. As a practical contribution, we used VFCFinder to backfill over 300 missing VFCs in the GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) database. All of the VFCs were accepted and merged into the GHSA database. In addition to demonstrating a practical pairing of security advisories to VFCs, our general open-source implementation will allow vulnerability database maintainers to drastically improve data quality, supporting efforts to secure the software supply chain.

> Falls are significant and often fatal for vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Previous works have addressed the detection of falls by relying on data capture by a single sensor, images or accelerometers. In this work, we rely on multimodal descriptors extracted from videos captured by egocentric cameras. Our proposed method includes a late decision fusion layer that builds on top of the extracted descriptors. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset on which we assess our proposed approach. We believe this is the first public dataset of its kind. The dataset comprises 10,948 video samples by 14 subjects. We conducted ablation experiments to assess the performance of individual feature extractors, fusion of visual information, and fusion of both visual and audio information. Moreover, we experimented with internal and external cross-validation. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of audio and visual information through late decision fusion improves detection performance, making it a promising tool for fall prevention and mitigation.

> Behavioral testing in NLP allows fine-grained evaluation of systems by examining their linguistic capabilities through the analysis of input-output behavior. Unfortunately, existing work on behavioral testing in Machine Translation (MT) is currently restricted to largely handcrafted tests covering a limited range of capabilities and languages. To address this limitation, we propose to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a diverse set of source sentences tailored to test the behavior of MT models in a range of situations. We can then verify whether the MT model exhibits the expected behavior through matching candidate sets that are also generated using LLMs. Our approach aims to make behavioral testing of MT systems practical while requiring only minimal human effort. In our experiments, we apply our proposed evaluation framework to assess multiple available MT systems, revealing that while in general pass-rates follow the trends observable from traditional accuracy-based metrics, our method was able to uncover several important differences and potential bugs that go unnoticed when relying only on accuracy.

<summary>2023-11-03 01:50:36 - Deep Learning-driven Community Resilience Rating based on Intertwined Socio-Technical Systems Features</summary>

- *Kai Yin, Ali Mostafavi*

- `2311.01661v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01661v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01661v1)

> Community resilience is a complex and muti-faceted phenomenon that emerges from complex and nonlinear interactions among different socio-technical systems and their resilience properties. However, present studies on community resilience focus primarily on vulnerability assessment and utilize index-based approaches, with limited ability to capture heterogeneous features within community socio-technical systems and their nonlinear interactions in shaping robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness components of resilience. To address this gap, this paper presents an integrated three-layer deep learning model for community resilience rating (called Resili-Net). Twelve measurable resilience features are specified and computed within community socio-technical systems (i.e., facilities, infrastructures, and society) related to three resilience components of robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness. Using publicly accessible data from multiple metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, Resili-Net characterizes the resilience levels of spatial areas into five distinct levels. The interpretability of the model outcomes enables feature analysis for specifying the determinants of resilience in areas within each resilience level, allowing for the identification of specific resilience enhancement strategies. Changes in community resilience profiles under urban development patterns are further examined by changing the value of related socio-technical systems features. Accordingly, the outcomes provide novel perspectives for community resilience assessment by harnessing machine intelligence and heterogeneous urban big data.

- *Donghua Wang, Wen Yao, Tingsong Jiang, Xiaoqian Chen*

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are demonstrated to be vulnerable to universal perturbation, a single quasi-perceptible perturbation that can deceive the DNN on most images. However, the previous works are focused on using universal perturbation to perform adversarial attacks, while the potential usability of universal perturbation as data carriers in data hiding is less explored, especially for the key-controlled data hiding method. In this paper, we propose a novel universal perturbation-based secret key-controlled data-hiding method, realizing data hiding with a single universal perturbation and data decoding with the secret key-controlled decoder. Specifically, we optimize a single universal perturbation, which serves as a data carrier that can hide multiple secret images and be added to most cover images. Then, we devise a secret key-controlled decoder to extract different secret images from the single container image constructed by the universal perturbation by using different secret keys. Moreover, a suppress loss function is proposed to prevent the secret image from leakage. Furthermore, we adopt a robust module to boost the decoder's capability against corruption. Finally, A co-joint optimization strategy is proposed to find the optimal universal perturbation and decoder. Extensive experiments are conducted on different datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, the physical test performed on platforms (e.g., WeChat and Twitter) verifies the usability of the proposed method in practice.

- `2311.01698v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01698v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01698v1)

> Cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (CMA2B) consider the collaborative efforts of multiple agents in a shared multi-armed bandit game. We study latent vulnerabilities exposed by this collaboration and consider adversarial attacks on a few agents with the goal of influencing the decisions of the rest. More specifically, we study adversarial attacks on CMA2B in both homogeneous settings, where agents operate with the same arm set, and heterogeneous settings, where agents have distinct arm sets. In the homogeneous setting, we propose attack strategies that, by targeting just one agent, convince all agents to select a particular target arm $T-o(T)$ times while incurring $o(T)$ attack costs in $T$ rounds. In the heterogeneous setting, we prove that a target arm attack requires linear attack costs and propose attack strategies that can force a maximum number of agents to suffer linear regrets while incurring sublinear costs and only manipulating the observations of a few target agents. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed attack strategies.

> This study addresses the security challenges associated with the current internet transformations, specifically focusing on emerging technologies such as blockchain and decentralized storage. It also investigates the role of Web3 applications in shaping the future of the internet. The primary objective is to propose a novel design for 'smart certificates,' which are digital certificates that can be programmatically enforced. Utilizing such certificates, an enterprise can better protect itself from cyberattacks and ensure the security of its data and systems. Web3 recent security solutions by companies and projects like Certik, Forta, Slither, and Securify are the equivalent of code scanning tool that were originally developed for Web1 and Web2 applications, and definitely not like certificates to help enterprises feel safe against cyberthreats. We aim to improve the resilience of enterprises' digital infrastructure by building on top of Web3 application and put methodologies in place for vulnerability analysis and attack correlation, focusing on architecture of different layers, Wallet/Client, Application and Smart Contract, where specific components are provided to identify and predict threats and risks. Furthermore, Certificate Transparency is used for enhancing the security, trustworthiness and decentralized management of the certificates, and detecting misuses, compromises, and malfeasances.

> A core challenge in the development of increasingly capable AI systems is to make them safe and reliable by ensuring their behaviour is consistent with human values. This challenge, known as the alignment problem, does not merely apply to hypothetical future AI systems that may pose catastrophic risks; it already applies to current systems, such as large language models, whose potential for harm is rapidly increasing. In this paper, I assess whether we are on track to solve the alignment problem for large language models, and what that means for the safety of future AI systems. I argue that existing strategies for alignment are insufficient, because large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can reliably elicit unsafe behaviour. I offer an explanation of this lingering vulnerability on which it is not simply a contingent limitation of current language models, but has deep technical ties to a crucial aspect of what makes these models useful and versatile in the first place -- namely, their remarkable aptitude to learn "in context" directly from user instructions. It follows that the alignment problem is not only unsolved for current AI systems, but may be intrinsically difficult to solve without severely undermining their capabilities. Furthermore, this assessment raises concerns about the prospect of ensuring the safety of future and more capable AI systems.

- `2311.16139v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16139v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16139v1)

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have increasingly become an indispensable tool in learning from graph-structured data, catering to various applications including social network analysis, recommendation systems, etc. At the heart of these networks are the edges which are crucial in guiding GNN models' predictions. In many scenarios, these edges represent sensitive information, such as personal associations or financial dealings -- thus requiring privacy assurance. However, their contributions to GNN model predictions may in turn be exploited by the adversary to compromise their privacy. Motivated by these conflicting requirements, this paper investigates edge privacy in contexts where adversaries possess black-box GNN model access, restricted further by access controls, preventing direct insights into arbitrary node outputs. In this context, we introduce a series of privacy attacks grounded on the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. These strategies allow adversaries to deduce connections between two nodes not by directly analyzing the model's output for these pairs but by analyzing the output for nodes linked to them. Our evaluation with seven real-life datasets and four GNN architectures underlines a significant vulnerability: even in systems fortified with access control mechanisms, an adaptive adversary can decipher private connections between nodes, thereby revealing potentially sensitive relationships and compromising the confidentiality of the graph.

> Headphones, traditionally limited to audio playback, have evolved to integrate sensors like high-definition microphones and accelerometers. While these advancements enhance user experience, they also introduce potential eavesdropping vulnerabilities, with keystroke inference being our concern in this work. To validate this threat, we developed OverHear, a keystroke inference framework that leverages both acoustic and accelerometer data from headphones. The accelerometer data, while not sufficiently detailed for individual keystroke identification, aids in clustering key presses by hand position. Concurrently, the acoustic data undergoes analysis to extract Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), aiding in distinguishing between different keystrokes. These features feed into machine learning models for keystroke prediction, with results further refined via dictionary-based word prediction methods. In our experimental setup, we tested various keyboard types under different environmental conditions. We were able to achieve top-5 key prediction accuracy of around 80% for mechanical keyboards and around 60% for membrane keyboards with top-100 word prediction accuracies over 70% for all keyboard types. The results highlight the effectiveness and limitations of our approach in the context of real-world scenarios.

- `2311.02378v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02378v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02378v1)

> Deep generative models are promising in detecting novel cyber-physical attacks, mitigating the vulnerability of Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) without relying on labeled information. Nonetheless, these generative models face challenges in identifying attack behaviors that closely resemble normal data, or deviate from the normal data distribution but are in close proximity to the manifold of the normal cluster in latent space. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel unsupervised dual variational generative adversarial model named MST-DVGAN, to perform anomaly detection in multivariate time series data for CPS security. The central concept is to enhance the model's discriminative capability by widening the distinction between reconstructed abnormal samples and their normal counterparts. Specifically, we propose an augmented module by imposing contrastive constraints on the reconstruction process to obtain a more compact embedding. Then, by exploiting the distribution property and modeling the normal patterns of multivariate time series, a variational autoencoder is introduced to force the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate diverse samples. Furthermore, two augmented loss functions are designed to extract essential characteristics in a self-supervised manner through mutual guidance between the augmented samples and original samples. Finally, a specific feature center loss is introduced for the generator network to enhance its stability. Empirical experiments are conducted on three public datasets, namely SWAT, WADI and NSL_KDD. Comparing with the state-of-the-art methods, the evaluation results show that the proposed MTS-DVGAN is more stable and can achieve consistent performance improvement.

> Gene regulatory relationships can be abstracted as a gene regulatory network (GRN), which plays a key role in characterizing complex cellular processes and pathways. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs), as a class of deep learning models, have emerged as a useful tool to infer gene regulatory relationships from gene expression data. However, deep learning models have been found to be vulnerable to noise, which greatly hinders the adoption of deep learning in constructing GRNs, because high noise is often unavoidable in the process of gene expression measurement. Can we preferably prototype a robust GNN for constructing GRNs? In this paper, we give a positive answer by proposing a Quadratic Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) with a dual attention mechanism. We study the changes in the predictive accuracy of Q-GAT and 9 state-of-the-art baselines by introducing different levels of adversarial perturbations. Experiments in the E. coli and S. cerevisiae datasets suggest that Q-GAT outperforms the state-of-the-art models in robustness. Lastly, we dissect why Q-GAT is robust through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and interpretability analyses. The former informs that nonlinear aggregation of quadratic neurons can amplify useful signals and suppress unwanted noise, thereby facilitating robustness, while the latter reveals that Q-GAT can leverage more features in prediction thanks to the dual attention mechanism, which endows Q-GAT with the ability to confront adversarial perturbation. We have shared our code in https://github.com/Minorway/Q-GAT_for_Robust_Construction_of_GRN for readers' evaluation.

> In today's digitally interconnected world, cybersecurity threats have reached unprecedented levels, presenting a pressing concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. This study employs a qualitative research approach to comprehensively examine the diverse threats of cybersecurity and their impacts across various sectors. Four primary categories of threats are identified and analyzed, encompassing malware attacks, social engineering attacks, network vulnerabilities, and data breaches. The research delves into the consequences of these threats on individuals, organizations, and society at large. The findings reveal a range of key emerging threats in cybersecurity, including advanced persistent threats, ransomware attacks, Internet of Things (IoT) vulnerabilities, and social engineering exploits. Consequently, it is evident that emerging cybersecurity threats pose substantial risks to both organizations and individuals. The sophistication and diversity of these emerging threats necessitate a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. This approach should include robust security measures, comprehensive employee training, and regular security audits. The implications of these emerging threats are extensive, with potential consequences such as financial loss, reputational damage, and compromised personal information. This study emphasizes the importance of implementing effective measures to mitigate these threats. It highlights the significance of using strong passwords, encryption methods, and regularly updating software to bolster cyber defenses.

> Neural network models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and adversarial transferability further increases the risk of adversarial attacks. Current methods based on transferability often rely on substitute models, which can be impractical and costly in real-world scenarios due to the unavailability of training data and the victim model's structural details. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that directly constructs adversarial examples by extracting transferable features across various tasks. Our key insight is that adversarial transferability can extend across different tasks. Specifically, we train a sequence-to-sequence generative model named CT-GAT using adversarial sample data collected from multiple tasks to acquire universal adversarial features and generate adversarial examples for different tasks. We conduct experiments on ten distinct datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves superior attack performance with small cost.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent graph learning model in various graph-based tasks over the years. Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing. Open-source code can be found at https://github.com/yushundong/ELEGANT.

> Here we introduce an improved approach to Variational Quantum Attack Algorithms (VQAA) on crytographic protocols. Our methods provide robust quantum attacks to well-known cryptographic algorithms, more efficiently and with remarkably fewer qubits than previous approaches. We implement simulations of our attacks for symmetric-key protocols such as S-DES, S-AES and Blowfish. For instance, we show how our attack allows a classical simulation of a small 8-qubit quantum computer to find the secret key of one 32-bit Blowfish instance with 24 times fewer number of iterations than a brute-force attack. Our work also shows improvements in attack success rates for lightweight ciphers such as S-DES and S-AES. Further applications beyond symmetric-key cryptography are also discussed, including asymmetric-key protocols and hash functions. In addition, we also comment on potential future improvements of our methods. Our results bring one step closer assessing the vulnerability of large-size classical cryptographic protocols with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and set the stage for future research in quantum cybersecurity.

> Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used for generating synthetic data for cases where there is a limited size real-world dataset or when data holders are unwilling to share their data samples. Recent works showed that GANs, due to overfitting and memorization, might leak information regarding their training data samples. This makes GANs vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). Several defense strategies have been proposed in the literature to mitigate this privacy issue. Unfortunately, defense strategies based on differential privacy are proven to reduce extensively the quality of the synthetic data points. On the other hand, more recent frameworks such as PrivGAN and PAR-GAN are not suitable for small-size training datasets. In the present work, the overfitting in GANs is studied in terms of the discriminator, and a more general measure of overfitting based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient is defined. Then, inspired by Fano's inequality, our first defense mechanism against MIAs is proposed. This framework, which requires only a simple modification in the loss function of GANs, is referred to as the maximum entropy GAN or MEGAN and significantly improves the robustness of GANs to MIAs. As a second defense strategy, a more heuristic model based on minimizing the information leaked from generated samples about the training data points is presented. This approach is referred to as mutual information minimization GAN (MIMGAN) and uses a variational representation of the mutual information to minimize the information that a synthetic sample might leak about the whole training data set. Applying the proposed frameworks to some commonly used data sets against state-of-the-art MIAs reveals that the proposed methods can reduce the accuracy of the adversaries to the level of random guessing accuracy with a small reduction in the quality of the synthetic data samples.

Online platforms often serve as breeding grounds for such content, and malicious actors exploit the vulnerabilities of audiences to shape public opinion. Although there have been research efforts aimed at the automatic identification of disinformation and propaganda in social media content, there remain challenges in terms of performance. The ArAIEval shared task aims to further research on these particular issues within the context of the Arabic language. In this paper, we discuss our participation in these shared tasks. We competed in subtasks 1A and 2A, where our submitted system secured positions 9th and 10th, respectively. Our experiments consist of fine-tuning transformer models and using zero- and few-shot learning with GPT-4.

> Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities to infiltrate a device's firmware and the communication between firmware binaries, in order to pass between them. To improve cybersecurity, organizations must identify and mitigate the risks of the firmware they use. An attack graph (AG) can be used to assess and visually display firmware's risks by organizing the identified vulnerabilities into attack paths composed of sequences of actions attackers may perform to compromise firmware images. In this paper, we utilize AGs for firmware risk assessment. We propose MIRAGE (Multi-binary Image Risk Assessment with Attack Graph Employment), a framework for identifying potential attack vectors and vulnerable interactions between firmware binaries; MIRAGE accomplishes this by generating AGs for firmware inter-binary communication. The use cases of the proposed firmware AG generation framework include the identification of risky external interactions, supply chain risk assessment, and security analysis with digital twins. To evaluate the MIRAGE framework, we collected a dataset of 703 firmware images. We also propose a model for examining the risks of firmware binaries, demonstrate the model's implementation on the dataset of firmware images, and list the riskiest binaries.

> The Rowhammer vulnerability continues to get worse, with the Rowhammer Threshold (TRH) reducing from 139K activations to 4.8K activations over the last decade. Typical Rowhammer mitigations rely on tracking aggressor rows. The number of possible aggressors increases with lowering thresholds, making it difficult to reliably track such rows in a storage-efficient manner. At lower thresholds, academic trackers such as Graphene require prohibitive SRAM overheads (hundreds of KBs to MB). Recent in-DRAM trackers from industry, such as DSAC-TRR, perform approximate tracking, sacrificing guaranteed protection for reduced storage overheads, leaving DRAM vulnerable to Rowhammer attacks. Ideally, we seek a scalable tracker that tracks securely and precisely, and incurs negligible dedicated SRAM and performance overheads, while still being able to track arbitrarily low thresholds. To that end, we propose START - a Scalable Tracker for Any Rowhammer Threshold. Rather than relying on dedicated SRAM structures, START dynamically repurposes a small fraction the Last-Level Cache (LLC) to store tracking metadata. START is based on the observation that while the memory contains millions of rows, typical workloads touch only a small subset of rows within a refresh period of 64ms, so allocating tracking entries on demand significantly reduces storage. If the application does not access many rows in memory, START does not reserve any LLC capacity. Otherwise, START dynamically uses 1-way, 2-way, or 8-way of the cache set based on demand. START consumes, on average, 9.4% of the LLC capacity to store metadata, which is 5x lower compared to dedicating a counter in LLC for each row in memory. We also propose START-M, a memory-mapped START for large-memory systems. Our designs require only 4KB SRAM for newly added structures and perform within 1% of idealized tracking even at TRH of less than 100.

- `2311.03616v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03616v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03616v1)

> What types of governance arrangements makes some self-governed online groups more vulnerable to disinformation campaigns? To answer this question, we present a qualitative comparative analysis of the Croatian and Serbian Wikipedia editions. We do so because between at least 2011 and 2020, the Croatian language version of Wikipedia was taken over by a small group of administrators who introduced far-right bias and outright disinformation; dissenting editorial voices were reverted, banned, and blocked. Although Serbian Wikipedia is roughly similar in size and age, shares many linguistic and cultural features, and faced similar threats, it seems to have largely avoided this fate. Based on a grounded theory analysis of interviews with members of both communities and others in cross-functional platform-level roles, we propose that the convergence of three features -- high perceived value as a target, limited early bureaucratic openness, and a preference for personalistic, informal forms of organization over formal ones -- produced a window of opportunity for governance capture on Croatian Wikipedia. Our findings illustrate that online community governing infrastructures can play a crucial role in systematic disinformation campaigns and other influence operations.

> While GPT-4V(ision) impressively models both visual and textual information simultaneously, it's hallucination behavior has not been systematically assessed. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, namely, the Bias and Interference Challenges in Visual Language Models (Bingo). This benchmark is designed to evaluate and shed light on the two common types of hallucinations in visual language models: bias and interference. Here, bias refers to the model's tendency to hallucinate certain types of responses, possibly due to imbalance in its training data. Interference pertains to scenarios where the judgment of GPT-4V(ision) can be disrupted due to how the text prompt is phrased or how the input image is presented. We identify a notable regional bias, whereby GPT-4V(ision) is better at interpreting Western images or images with English writing compared to images from other countries or containing text in other languages. Moreover, GPT-4V(ision) is vulnerable to leading questions and is often confused when interpreting multiple images together. Popular mitigation approaches, such as self-correction and chain-of-thought reasoning, are not effective in resolving these challenges. We also identified similar biases and interference vulnerabilities with LLaVA and Bard. Our results characterize the hallucination challenges in GPT-4V(ision) and state-of-the-art visual-language models, and highlight the need for new solutions. The Bingo benchmark is available at https://github.com/gzcch/Bingo.

> The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a linchpin of modern computing systems, governing secure system initialization and booting. This paper is urgently needed because of the surge in UEFI-related attacks and vulnerabilities in recent years. Motivated by this urgent concern, we undertake an extensive exploration of the UEFI landscape, dissecting its distribution supply chain, booting process, and security features. We carefully study a spectrum of UEFI-targeted attacks and proofs of concept (PoCs) for exploiting UEFI-related vulnerabilities. Building upon these insights, we construct a comprehensive attack threat model encompassing threat actors, attack vectors, attack types, vulnerabilities, attack capabilities, and attacker objectives. Drawing inspiration from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we present a MITRE ATT&CK-like taxonomy delineating tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques in the context of UEFI attacks. This taxonomy can provide a road map for identifying existing gaps and developing new techniques for rootkit prevention, detection, and removal. Finally, the paper discusses existing countermeasures against UEFI attacks including a variety of technical and operational measures that can be implemented to lower the risk of UEFI attacks to an acceptable level. This paper seeks to clarify the complexities of UEFI and equip the cybersecurity community with the necessary knowledge to strengthen the security of this critical component against a growing threat landscape.

> As the complexity of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs continues to increase, ensuring thorough verification becomes a significant challenge for system integrators. The complexity of verification can result in undetected bugs. Unlike software or firmware bugs, hardware bugs are hard to fix after deployment and they require additional logic, i.e., patching logic integrated with the design in advance in order to patch. However, the absence of a standardized metric for defining "patchability" leaves system integrators relying on their understanding of each IP and security requirements to engineer ad hoc patching designs. In this paper, we propose a theoretical patchability quantification method to analyze designs at the Register Transfer Level (RTL) with provided patching options. Our quantification defines patchability as a combination of observability and controllability so that we can analyze and compare the patchability of IP variations. This quantification is a systematic approach to estimate each patching architecture's ability to patch at run-time and complements existing patching works. In experiments, we compare several design options of the same patching architecture and discuss their differences in terms of theoretical patchability and how many potential weaknesses can be mitigated.

> Symbolic Execution is a formal method that can be used to verify the behavior of computer programs and detect software vulnerabilities. Compared to other testing methods such as fuzzing, Symbolic Execution has the advantage of providing formal guarantees about the program. However, despite advances in performance in recent years, Symbolic Execution is too slow to be applied to real-world software. This is primarily caused by the \emph{path explosion problem} as well as by the computational complexity of SMT solving. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer approach for symbolic execution by executing individual slices and later combining the side effects. This way, the overall problem size is kept small, reducing the impact of computational complexity on large problems.

> For better or worse, JavaScript is the cornerstone of modern Web. Prototype-based languages like JavaScript are susceptible to prototype pollution vulnerabilities, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary properties into an object's prototype. The attacker can subsequently capitalize on the injected properties by executing otherwise benign pieces of code, so-called gadgets, that perform security-sensitive operations. The success of an attack largely depends on the presence of gadgets, leading to high-profile exploits such as privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution (ACE).   This paper proposes Dasty, the first semi-automated pipeline to help developers identify gadgets in their applications' software supply chain. Dasty targets server-side Node.js applications and relies on an enhancement of dynamic taint analysis which we implement with the dynamic AST-level instrumentation. Moreover, Dasty provides support for visualization of code flows with an IDE, thus facilitating the subsequent manual analysis for building proof-of-concept exploits. To illustrate the danger of gadgets, we use Dasty in a study of the most dependent-upon NPM packages to analyze the presence of gadgets leading to ACE. Dasty identifies 1,269 server-side packages, of which 631 have code flows that may reach dangerous sinks. We manually prioritize and verify the candidate flows to build proof-of-concept exploits for 49 NPM packages, including popular packages such as ejs, nodemailer and workerpool. To investigate how Dasty integrates with existing tools to find end-to-end exploits, we conduct an in-depth analysis of a popular data visualization dashboard to find one high-severity CVE-2023-31415 leading to remote code execution. For the first time, our results systematically demonstrate the dangers of server-side gadgets and call for further research to solve the problem.

<summary>2023-11-07 16:31:56 - Do Language Models Learn Semantics of Code? A Case Study in Vulnerability Detection</summary>

- *Benjamin Steenhoek, Md Mahbubur Rahman, Shaila Sharmin, Wei Le*

> Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task. These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset. Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance. In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis. We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS). We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths. Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs. We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning. We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements. Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.

> As large language models become more prevalent, their possible harmful or inappropriate responses are a cause for concern. This paper introduces a unique dataset containing adversarial examples in the form of questions, which we call AttaQ, designed to provoke such harmful or inappropriate responses. We assess the efficacy of our dataset by analyzing the vulnerabilities of various models when subjected to it. Additionally, we introduce a novel automatic approach for identifying and naming vulnerable semantic regions - input semantic areas for which the model is likely to produce harmful outputs. This is achieved through the application of specialized clustering techniques that consider both the semantic similarity of the input attacks and the harmfulness of the model's responses. Automatically identifying vulnerable semantic regions enhances the evaluation of model weaknesses, facilitating targeted improvements to its safety mechanisms and overall reliability.

> The growing adoption of declarative software specification languages, coupled with their inherent difficulty in debugging, has underscored the need for effective and automated repair techniques applicable to such languages. Researchers have recently explored various methods to automatically repair declarative software specifications, such as template-based repair, feedback-driven iterative repair, and bounded exhaustive approaches. The latest developments in large language models provide new opportunities for the automatic repair of declarative specifications. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT to repair software specifications written in the Alloy declarative language. Unlike imperative languages, specifications in Alloy are not executed but rather translated into logical formulas and evaluated using backend constraint solvers to identify specification instances and counterexamples to assertions. Our evaluation focuses on ChatGPT's ability to improve the correctness and completeness of Alloy declarative specifications through automatic repairs. We analyze the results produced by ChatGPT and compare them with those of leading automatic Alloy repair methods. Our study revealed that while ChatGPT falls short in comparison to existing techniques, it was able to successfully repair bugs that no other technique could address. Our analysis also identified errors in ChatGPT's generated repairs, including improper operator usage, type errors, higher-order logic misuse, and relational arity mismatches. Additionally, we observed instances of hallucinations in ChatGPT-generated repairs and inconsistency in its results. Our study provides valuable insights for software practitioners, researchers, and tool builders considering ChatGPT for declarative specification repairs.

> Contactless fingerprint recognition offers a higher level of user comfort and addresses hygiene concerns more effectively. However, it is also more vulnerable to presentation attacks such as photo paper, paper-printout, and various display attacks, which makes it more challenging to implement in biometric systems compared to contact-based modalities. Limited research has been conducted on presentation attacks in contactless fingerprint systems, and these studies have encountered challenges in terms of generalization and scalability since both bonafide samples and presentation attacks are utilized during training model. Although this approach appears promising, it lacks the ability to handle unseen attacks, which is a crucial factor for developing PAD methods that can generalize effectively. We introduced an innovative anti-spoofing approach that combines an unsupervised autoencoder with a convolutional block attention module to address the limitations of existing methods. Our model is exclusively trained on bonafide images without exposure to any spoofed samples during the training phase. It is then evaluated against various types of presentation attack images in the testing phase. The scheme we proposed has achieved an average BPCER of 0.96\% with an APCER of 1.6\% for presentation attacks involving various types of spoofed samples.

> Language models have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose LEAP, a novel system that uses language models to perform multi-step logical reasoning and incorporates explicit planning into the inference procedure. Explicit planning enables the system to make more informed reasoning decisions at each step by looking ahead into their future effects. Moreover, we propose a training strategy that safeguards the planning process from being led astray by spurious features. Our full system significantly outperforms other competing methods on multiple standard datasets. When using small T5 models as its core selection and deduction components, our system performs competitively compared to GPT-3 despite having only about 1B parameters (i.e., 175 times smaller than GPT-3). When using GPT-3.5, it significantly outperforms chain-of-thought prompting on the challenging PrOntoQA dataset. We have conducted extensive empirical studies to demonstrate that explicit planning plays a crucial role in the system's performance.

> Product attribute value extraction is an important task in e-Commerce which can help several downstream applications such as product search and recommendation. Most previous models handle this task using sequence labeling or question answering method which rely on the sequential position information of values in the product text and are vulnerable to data discrepancy between training and testing. This limits their generalization ability to real-world scenario in which each product can have multiple descriptions across various shopping platforms with different composition of text and style. They also have limited zero-shot ability to new values. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning model with value generation/classification and attribute prediction called JPAVE to predict values without the necessity of position information of values in the text. Furthermore, the copy mechanism in value generator and the value attention module in value classifier help our model address the data discrepancy issue by only focusing on the relevant part of input text and ignoring other information which causes the discrepancy issue such as sentence structure in the text. Besides, two variants of our model are designed for open-world and closed-world scenarios. In addition, copy mechanism introduced in the first variant based on value generation can improve its zero-shot ability for identifying unseen values. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with strong baselines and its generalization ability of predicting new values.

> Floods are one of the most common disasters globally. Flood affects humans in many ways. Therefore, rapid assessment is needed to assess the effect of floods and to take early action to support the vulnerable community in time. Sentinel-1 is one such Earth Observation (EO) mission widely used for mapping the flooding conditions at a 10m scale. However, various preprocessing steps are involved before analyses of the Sentinel-1 data. Researchers sometimes avoid a few necessary corrections since it is time-consuming and complex. Standardization of the Sentinel-1 data is the need of the hour, specifically for supporting researchers to use the Standardized Analysis-Ready (STAR) data cube without experiencing the complexity of the Sentinel-1 data processing. In the present study, we proposed a workflow to use STAR in Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. The Nigeria Flood of 2022 has been used as a case study for assessing the model performance.

> We introduce a novel approach for testing static typing implementations based on the concept of API-driven program synthesis. The idea is to synthesize type-intensive but small and well-typed programs by leveraging and combining application programming interfaces (APIs) derived from existing software libraries. Our primary insight is backed up by real-world evidence: a significant number of compiler typing bugs are caused by small test cases that employ APIs from the standard library of the language under test. This is attributed to the inherent complexity of the majority of these APIs, which often exercise a wide range of sophisticated type-related features. The main contribution of our approach is the ability to produce small client programs with increased feature coverage, without bearing the burden of generating the corresponding well-formed API definitions from scratch. To validate diverse aspects of static typing procedures (i.e., soundness, precision of type inference), we also enrich our API-driven approach with fault-injection and semantics-preserving modes, along with their corresponding test oracles.   We evaluate our implemented tool, Thalia on testing the static typing implementations of the compilers for three popular languages, namely, Scala, Kotlin, and Groovy. Thalia has uncovered 84 typing bugs (77 confirmed and 22 fixed), most of which are triggered by test cases featuring APIs that rely on parametric polymorphism, overloading, and higher-order functions. Our comparison with state-of-the-art shows that Thalia yields test programs with distinct characteristics, offering additional and complementary benefits.

> Machine Learning (ML) models become vulnerable to Model Stealing Attacks (MSA) when they are deployed as a service. In such attacks, the deployed model is queried repeatedly to build a labelled dataset. This dataset allows the attacker to train a thief model that mimics the original model. To maximize query efficiency, the attacker has to select the most informative subset of data points from the pool of available data. Existing attack strategies utilize approaches like Active Learning and Semi-Supervised learning to minimize costs. However, in the black-box setting, these approaches may select sub-optimal samples as they train only one thief model. Depending on the thief model's capacity and the data it was pretrained on, the model might even select noisy samples that harm the learning process. In this work, we explore the usage of an ensemble of deep learning models as our thief model. We call our attack Army of Thieves(AOT) as we train multiple models with varying complexities to leverage the crowd's wisdom. Based on the ensemble's collective decision, uncertain samples are selected for querying, while the most confident samples are directly included in the training data. Our approach is the first one to utilize an ensemble of thief models to perform model extraction. We outperform the base approaches of existing state-of-the-art methods by at least 3% and achieve a 21% higher adversarial sample transferability than previous work for models trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

> Deep networks tend to learn spurious feature-label correlations in real-world supervised learning tasks. This vulnerability is aggravated in distillation, where a student model may have lesser representational capacity than the corresponding teacher model. Often, knowledge of specific spurious correlations is used to reweight instances & rebalance the learning process. We propose a novel early readout mechanism whereby we attempt to predict the label using representations from earlier network layers. We show that these early readouts automatically identify problem instances or groups in the form of confident, incorrect predictions. Leveraging these signals to modulate the distillation loss on an instance level allows us to substantially improve not only group fairness measures across benchmark datasets, but also overall accuracy of the student model. We also provide secondary analyses that bring insight into the role of feature learning in supervision and distillation.

> During Automated Program Repair (APR), it can be challenging to synthesize correct patches for real-world systems in general-purpose programming languages. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be helpful "copilots" in assisting developers with various coding tasks, and have also been directly applied for patch synthesis. However, most LLMs treat programs as sequences of tokens, meaning that they are ignorant of the underlying semantics constraints of the target programming language. This results in plenty of statically invalid generated patches, impeding the practicality of the technique. Therefore, we propose Repilot, a general code generation framework to further copilot the AI "copilots" (i.e., LLMs) by synthesizing more valid patches during the repair process. Our key insight is that many LLMs produce outputs autoregressively (i.e., token by token), resembling human writing programs, which can be significantly boosted and guided through a Completion Engine. Repilot synergistically synthesizes a candidate patch through the interaction between an LLM and a Completion Engine, which 1) prunes away infeasible tokens suggested by the LLM and 2) proactively completes the token based on the suggestions provided by the Completion Engine. Our evaluation on a subset of the widely-used Defects4j 1.2 and 2.0 datasets shows that Repilot outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by fixing 27% and 47% more bugs, respectively. Moreover, Repilot produces more valid and correct patches than the base LLM with the same budget. While we focus on leveraging Repilot for APR in this work, the overall approach is also generalizable to other code generation tasks.

> Contemporary Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research relies primarily on neural network models for machine vision and speech understanding of a system user. Such models require extensively annotated training datasets for optimal performance and when building interfaces for users from a vulnerable population such as young children, GDPR introduces significant complexities in data collection, management, and processing. Motivated by the training needs of an Edge AI smart toy platform this research explores the latest advances in generative neural technologies and provides a working proof of concept of a controllable data generation pipeline for speech driven facial training data at scale. In this context, we demonstrate how StyleGAN2 can be finetuned to create a gender balanced dataset of children's faces. This dataset includes a variety of controllable factors such as facial expressions, age variations, facial poses, and even speech-driven animations with realistic lip synchronization. By combining generative text to speech models for child voice synthesis and a 3D landmark based talking heads pipeline, we can generate highly realistic, entirely synthetic, talking child video clips. These video clips can provide valuable, and controllable, synthetic training data for neural network models, bridging the gap when real data is scarce or restricted due to privacy regulations.

- *Haijian Shao, Ming Zhu, Shengjie Zhai*

- `2311.05075v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05075v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05075v1)

> Amid growing global mental health concerns, particularly among vulnerable groups, natural language processing offers a tremendous potential for early detection and intervention of people's mental disorders via analyzing their postings and discussions on social media platforms. However, ultra-sparse training data, often due to vast vocabularies and low-frequency words, hinders the analysis accuracy. Multi-labeling and Co-occurrences of symptoms may also blur the boundaries in distinguishing similar/co-related disorders. To address these issues, we propose a novel semantic feature preprocessing technique with a three-folded structure: 1) mitigating the feature sparsity with a weak classifier, 2) adaptive feature dimension with modulus loops, and 3) deep-mining and extending features among the contexts. With enhanced semantic features, we train a machine learning model to predict and classify mental disorders. We utilize the Reddit Mental Health Dataset 2022 to examine conditions such as Anxiety, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and Bipolar-Disorder (BD) and present solutions to the data sparsity challenge, highlighted by 99.81% non-zero elements. After applying our preprocessing technique, the feature sparsity decreases to 85.4%. Overall, our methods, when compared to seven benchmark models, demonstrate significant performance improvements: 8.0% in accuracy, 0.069 in precision, 0.093 in recall, 0.102 in F1 score, and 0.059 in AUC. This research provides foundational insights for mental health prediction and monitoring, providing innovative solutions to navigate challenges associated with ultra-sparse data feature and intricate multi-label classification in the domain of mental health analysis.

> Bug reproduction is a critical developer activity that is also challenging to automate, as bug reports are often in natural language and thus can be difficult to transform to test cases consistently. As a result, existing techniques mostly focused on crash bugs, which are easier to automatically detect and verify. In this work, we overcome this limitation by using large language models (LLMs), which have been demonstrated to be adept at natural language processing and code generation. By prompting LLMs to generate bug-reproducing tests, and via a post-processing pipeline to automatically identify promising generated tests, our proposed technique LIBRO could successfully reproduce about one-third of all bugs in the widely used Defects4J benchmark. Furthermore, our extensive evaluation on 15 LLMs, including 11 open-source LLMs, suggests that open-source LLMs also demonstrate substantial potential, with the StarCoder LLM achieving 70% of the reproduction performance of the closed-source OpenAI LLM code-davinci-002 on the large Defects4J benchmark, and 90% of performance on a held-out bug dataset likely not part of any LLM's training data. In addition, our experiments on LLMs of different sizes show that bug reproduction using LIBRO improves as LLM size increases, providing information as to which LLMs can be used with the LIBRO pipeline.

> Computer-based systems have solved several domain problems, including industrial, military, education, and wearable. Nevertheless, such arrangements need high-quality software to guarantee security and safety as both are mandatory for modern software products. We advocate that bounded model-checking techniques can efficiently detect vulnerabilities in general software systems. However, such an approach struggles to scale up and verify extensive code bases. Consequently, we have developed and evaluated a methodology to verify large software systems using a state-of-the-art bounded model checker. In particular, we pre-process input source-code files and guide the respective model checker to explore them systematically. Moreover, the proposed scheme includes a function-wise prioritization strategy, which readily provides results for code entities according to a scale of importance. Experimental results using a real implementation of the proposed methodology show that it can efficiently verify large software systems. Besides, it presented low peak memory allocation when executed. We have evaluated our approach by verifying twelve popular open-source C projects, where we have found real software vulnerabilities that their developers confirmed.

> With the increasing breaches and security threats that endanger health data, ensuring patients' privacy is essential. To that end, the research community has proposed various privacy-preserving approaches based on cryptography, hashing, or ledger technologies for alleviating health data vulnerability. To establish a comprehensive understanding of health data privacy risks, and the benefits and limitations of existing privacy-preserving approaches, we perform a detailed review of existing work and distill 10 distinct privacy concerns occurring in a health data lifecycle. Furthermore, we classify existing approaches based on their applicability to particular privacy concerns occurring at a particular lifecycle stage. Finally, we propose a taxonomy of techniques used for privacy preservation in healthcare and triangulate those techniques with the lifecycle stages and concerns. Our review indicates heavy usage of cryptographical techniques in this domain. However, we have also found that healthcare systems have special requirements that require novel cryptographic techniques and security schemes to address special needs. Therefore, we identify several future research directions to mitigate the security challenges for privacy preservation in health data management.

> We study indiscriminate poisoning for linear learners where an adversary injects a few crafted examples into the training data with the goal of forcing the induced model to incur higher test error. Inspired by the observation that linear learners on some datasets are able to resist the best known attacks even without any defenses, we further investigate whether datasets can be inherently robust to indiscriminate poisoning attacks for linear learners. For theoretical Gaussian distributions, we rigorously characterize the behavior of an optimal poisoning attack, defined as the poisoning strategy that attains the maximum risk of the induced model at a given poisoning budget. Our results prove that linear learners can indeed be robust to indiscriminate poisoning if the class-wise data distributions are well-separated with low variance and the size of the constraint set containing all permissible poisoning points is also small. These findings largely explain the drastic variation in empirical attack performance of the state-of-the-art poisoning attacks on linear learners across benchmark datasets, making an important initial step towards understanding the underlying reasons some learning tasks are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks.

> Misinformation proliferation on social media platforms is a pervasive threat to the integrity of online public discourse. Genuine users, susceptible to others' influence, often unknowingly engage with, endorse, and re-share questionable pieces of information, collectively amplifying the spread of misinformation. In this study, we introduce an empirical framework to investigate users' susceptibility to influence when exposed to unreliable and reliable information sources. Leveraging two datasets on political and public health discussions on Twitter, we analyze the impact of exposure on the adoption of information sources, examining how the reliability of the source modulates this relationship. Our findings provide evidence that increased exposure augments the likelihood of adoption. Users tend to adopt low-credibility sources with fewer exposures than high-credibility sources, a trend that persists even among non-partisan users. Furthermore, the number of exposures needed for adoption varies based on the source credibility, with extreme ends of the spectrum (very high or low credibility) requiring fewer exposures for adoption. Additionally, we reveal that the adoption of information sources often mirrors users' prior exposure to sources with comparable credibility levels. Our research offers critical insights for mitigating the endorsement of misinformation by vulnerable users, offering a framework to study the dynamics of content exposure and adoption on social media platforms.

- `2311.05826v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05826v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05826v1)

> Federated Learning (FL) is a promising technology that enables multiple actors to build a joint model without sharing their raw data. The distributed nature makes FL vulnerable to various poisoning attacks, including model poisoning attacks and data poisoning attacks. Today, many byzantine-resilient FL methods have been introduced to mitigate the model poisoning attack, while the effectiveness when defending against data poisoning attacks still remains unclear. In this paper, we focus on the most representative data poisoning attack - "label flipping attack" and monitor its effectiveness when attacking the existing FL methods. The results show that the existing FL methods perform similarly in Independent and identically distributed (IID) settings but fail to maintain the model robustness in Non-IID settings. To mitigate the weaknesses of existing FL methods in Non-IID scenarios, we introduce the Honest Score Client Selection (HSCS) scheme and the corresponding HSCSFL framework. In the HSCSFL, The server collects a clean dataset for evaluation. Under each iteration, the server collects the gradients from clients and then perform HSCS to select aggregation candidates. The server first evaluates the performance of each class of the global model and generates the corresponding risk vector to indicate which class could be potentially attacked. Similarly, the server evaluates the client's model and records the performance of each class as the accuracy vector. The dot product of each client's accuracy vector and global risk vector is generated as the client's host score; only the top p\% host score clients are included in the following aggregation. Finally, server aggregates the gradients and uses the outcome to update the global model. The comprehensive experimental results show our HSCSFL effectively enhances the FL robustness and defends against the "label flipping attack."

> The constant-time property is considered the security standard for cryptographic code. Code following the constant-time discipline is free from secret-dependent branches and memory accesses, and thus avoids leaking secrets through cache and timing side-channels. The constant-time property makes a number of implicit assumptions that are fundamentally at odds with the reality of cryptographic code. Constant-time is not robust. The first issue with constant-time is that it is a whole-program property: It relies on the entirety of the code base being constant-time. But, cryptographic developers do not generally write whole programs; rather, they provide libraries and specific algorithms for other application developers to use. As such, developers of security libraries must maintain their security guarantees even when their code is operating within (potentially untrusted) application contexts. Constant-time requires memory safety. The whole-program nature of constant-time also leads to a second issue: constant-time requires memory safety of all the running code. Any memory safety bugs, whether in the library or the application, will wend their way back to side-channel leaks of secrets if not direct disclosure. And although cryptographic libraries should (and are) written to be memory-safe, it is unfortunately unrealistic to expect the same from every application that uses each library. We formalize robust constant-time and build a RobustIsoCrypt compiler that transforms the library code and protects the secrets even when they are linked with untrusted code. Our evaluation with SUPERCOP benchmarking framework shows that the performance overhead is less than five percent on average.

> Recent advances in vision-language pre-trained models (VLPs) have significantly increased visual understanding and cross-modal analysis capabilities. Companies have emerged to provide multi-modal Embedding as a Service (EaaS) based on VLPs (e.g., CLIP-based VLPs), which cost a large amount of training data and resources for high-performance service. However, existing studies indicate that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks that induce great loss for the owners of VLPs. Protecting the intellectual property and commercial ownership of VLPs is increasingly crucial yet challenging. A major solution of watermarking model for EaaS implants a backdoor in the model by inserting verifiable trigger embeddings into texts, but it is only applicable for large language models and is unrealistic due to data and model privacy. In this paper, we propose a safe and robust backdoor-based embedding watermarking method for VLPs called VLPMarker. VLPMarker utilizes embedding orthogonal transformation to effectively inject triggers into the VLPs without interfering with the model parameters, which achieves high-quality copyright verification and minimal impact on model performance. To enhance the watermark robustness, we further propose a collaborative copyright verification strategy based on both backdoor trigger and embedding distribution, enhancing resilience against various attacks. We increase the watermark practicality via an out-of-distribution trigger selection approach, removing access to the model training data and thus making it possible for many real-world scenarios. Our extensive experiments on various datasets indicate that the proposed watermarking approach is effective and safe for verifying the copyright of VLPs for multi-modal EaaS and robust against model extraction attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pter61/vlpmarker.

> The prompt-based learning paradigm, which bridges the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in few-shot settings. Despite being widely applied, prompt-based learning is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Textual backdoor attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into models by poisoning a subset of training samples through trigger injection and label modification. However, they suffer from flaws such as abnormal natural language expressions resulting from the trigger and incorrect labeling of poisoned samples. In this study, we propose ProAttack, a novel and efficient method for performing clean-label backdoor attacks based on the prompt, which uses the prompt itself as a trigger. Our method does not require external triggers and ensures correct labeling of poisoned samples, improving the stealthy nature of the backdoor attack. With extensive experiments on rich-resource and few-shot text classification tasks, we empirically validate ProAttack's competitive performance in textual backdoor attacks. Notably, in the rich-resource setting, ProAttack achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates in the clean-label backdoor attack benchmark without external triggers.

> Federated learning (FL) facilitates distributed training across different IoT and edge devices, safeguarding the privacy of their data. The inherent distributed structure of FL introduces vulnerabilities, especially from adversarial devices aiming to skew local updates to their advantage. Despite the plethora of research focusing on Byzantine-resilient FL, the academic community has yet to establish a comprehensive benchmark suite, pivotal for impartial assessment and comparison of different techniques. This paper presents Blades, a scalable, extensible, and easily configurable benchmark suite that supports researchers and developers in efficiently implementing and validating novel strategies against baseline algorithms in Byzantine-resilient FL. Blades contains built-in implementations of representative attack and defense strategies and offers a user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates new ideas. Using Blades, we re-evaluate representative attacks and defenses on wide-ranging experimental configurations (approximately 1,500 trials in total). Through our extensive experiments, we gained new insights into FL robustness and highlighted previously overlooked limitations due to the absence of thorough evaluations and comparisons of baselines under various attack settings.

> Executing code is essential for various program analysis tasks, e.g., to detect bugs that manifest through exceptions or to obtain execution traces for further dynamic analysis. However, executing an arbitrary piece of code is often difficult in practice, e.g., because of missing variable definitions, missing user inputs, and missing third-party dependencies. This paper presents LExecutor, a learning-guided approach for executing arbitrary code snippets in an underconstrained way. The key idea is to let a neural model predict missing values that otherwise would cause the program to get stuck, and to inject these values into the execution. For example, LExecutor injects likely values for otherwise undefined variables and likely return values of calls to otherwise missing functions. We evaluate the approach on Python code from popular open-source projects and on code snippets extracted from Stack Overflow. The neural model predicts realistic values with an accuracy between 79.5% and 98.2%, allowing LExecutor to closely mimic real executions. As a result, the approach successfully executes significantly more code than any available technique, such as simply executing the code as-is. For example, executing the open-source code snippets as-is covers only 4.1% of all lines, because the code crashes early on, whereas LExecutor achieves a coverage of 51.6%.

> The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the emergence of crowdsensing applications, where a multitude of interconnected devices collaboratively collect and analyze data. Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the data collected by these devices is crucial for reliable decision-making and maintaining trust in the system. Traditional authentication methods are often vulnerable to attacks or can be easily duplicated, posing challenges to securing crowdsensing applications. Besides, current solutions leveraging device behavior are mostly focused on device identification, which is a simpler task than authentication. To address these issues, an individual IoT device authentication framework based on hardware behavior fingerprinting and Transformer autoencoders is proposed in this work. This solution leverages the inherent imperfections and variations in IoT device hardware to differentiate between devices with identical specifications. By monitoring and analyzing the behavior of key hardware components, such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, and Storage on devices, unique fingerprints for each device are created. The performance samples are considered as time series data and used to train outlier detection transformer models, one per device and aiming to model its normal data distribution. Then, the framework is validated within a spectrum crowdsensing system leveraging Raspberry Pi devices. After a pool of experiments, the model from each device is able to individually authenticate it between the 45 devices employed for validation. An average True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.74+-0.13 and an average maximum False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.06+-0.09 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing authentication, security, and trust in crowdsensing applications.

> Context: Modern software systems (e.g., Apache Spark) are usually written in multiple programming languages (PLs). There is little understanding on the phenomenon of multi-programming-language commits (MPLCs), which involve modified source files written in multiple PLs. Objective: This work aims to explore MPLCs and their impacts on development difficulty and software quality. Methods: We performed an empirical study on eighteen non-trivial Apache projects with 197,566 commits. Results: (1) the most commonly used PL combination consists of all the four PLs, i.e., C/C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python; (2) 9% of the commits from all the projects are MPLCs, and the proportion of MPLCs in 83% of the projects goes to a relatively stable level; (3) more than 90% of the MPLCs from all the projects involve source files in two PLs; (4) the change complexity of MPLCs is significantly higher than that of non-MPLCs; (5) issues fixed in MPLCs take significantly longer to be resolved than issues fixed in non-MPLCs in 89% of the projects; (6) MPLCs do not show significant effects on issue reopen; (7) source files undergoing MPLCs tend to be more bug-prone; and (8) MPLCs introduce more bugs than non-MPLCs. Conclusions: MPLCs are related to increased development difficulty and decreased software quality.

> The global deployment of the phasor measurement units (PMUs) enables real-time monitoring of the power system, which has stimulated considerable research into machine learning-based models for event detection and classification. However, recent studies reveal that machine learning-based methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can fool the event classifiers by adding small perturbations to the raw PMU data. To mitigate the threats posed by adversarial attacks, research on defense strategies is urgently needed. This paper proposes an effective adversarial purification method based on the diffusion model to counter adversarial attacks on the machine learning-based power system event classifier. The proposed method includes two steps: injecting noise into the PMU data; and utilizing a pre-trained neural network to eliminate the added noise while simultaneously removing perturbations introduced by the adversarial attacks. The proposed adversarial purification method significantly increases the accuracy of the event classifier under adversarial attacks while satisfying the requirements of real-time operations. In addition, the theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed diffusion model-based adversarial purification method decreases the distance between the original and compromised PMU data, which reduces the impacts of adversarial attacks. The empirical results on a large-scale real-world PMU dataset validate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed adversarial purification method.

> Breathing rate is a vital health metric that is an invaluable indicator of the overall health of a person. In recent years, the non-contact measurement of health signals such as breathing rate has been a huge area of development, with a wide range of applications from telemedicine to driver monitoring systems. This paper presents an investigation into a method of non-contact breathing rate detection using a motion detection algorithm, optical flow. Optical flow is used to successfully measure breathing rate by tracking the motion of specific points on the body. In this study, the success of optical flow when using different sets of points is evaluated. Testing shows that both chest and facial movement can be used to determine breathing rate but to different degrees of success. The chest generates very accurate signals, with an RMSE of 0.63 on the tested videos. Facial points can also generate reliable signals when there is minimal head movement but are much more vulnerable to noise caused by head/body movements. These findings highlight the potential of optical flow as a non-invasive method for breathing rate detection and emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate points to optimize accuracy.

> Static analysis tools are commonly used to detect defects before the code is released. Previous research has focused on their overall effectiveness and their ability to detect defects. However, little is known about the usage patterns of warning suppressions: the configurations developers set up in order to prevent the appearance of specific warnings. We address this gap by analyzing how often are warning suppression features used, which warning suppression features are used and for what purpose, and also how could the use of warning suppression annotations be avoided. To answer these questions we examine 1\,425 open-source Java-based projects that utilize Findbugs or Spotbugs for warning-suppressing configurations and source code annotations. We find that although most warnings are suppressed, only a small portion of them get frequently suppressed. Contrary to expectations, false positives account for a minor proportion of suppressions. A significant number of suppressions introduce technical debt, suggesting potential disregard for code quality or a lack of appropriate guidance from the tool. Misleading suggestions and incorrect assumptions also lead to suppressions. Findings underscore the need for better communication and education related to the use of static analysis tools, improved bug pattern definitions, and better code annotation. Future research can extend these findings to other static analysis tools, and apply them to improve the effectiveness of static analysis.

> Urban flood risk emerges from complex and nonlinear interactions among multiple features related to flood hazard, flood exposure, and social and physical vulnerabilities, along with the complex spatial flood dependence relationships. Existing approaches for characterizing urban flood risk, however, are primarily based on flood plain maps, focusing on a limited number of features, primarily hazard and exposure features, without consideration of feature interactions or the dependence relationships among spatial areas. To address this gap, this study presents an integrated urban flood-risk rating model based on a novel unsupervised graph deep learning model (called FloodRisk-Net). FloodRisk-Net is capable of capturing spatial dependence among areas and complex and nonlinear interactions among flood hazards and urban features for specifying emergent flood risk. Using data from multiple metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States, the model characterizes their flood risk into six distinct city-specific levels. The model is interpretable and enables feature analysis of areas within each flood-risk level, allowing for the identification of the three archetypes shaping the highest flood risk within each MSA. Flood risk is found to be spatially distributed in a hierarchical structure within each MSA, where the core city disproportionately bears the highest flood risk. Multiple cities are found to have high overall flood-risk levels and low spatial inequality, indicating limited options for balancing urban development and flood-risk reduction. Relevant flood-risk reduction strategies are discussed considering ways that the highest flood risk and uneven spatial distribution of flood risk are formed.

- *Shashank Kotyan, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas*

- `2311.07928v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07928v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07928v1)

> Neural networks have revolutionized various domains, exhibiting remarkable accuracy in tasks like natural language processing and computer vision. However, their vulnerability to slight alterations in input samples poses challenges, particularly in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. Current approaches, such as introducing distortions during training, fall short in addressing unforeseen corruptions. This paper proposes an innovative adversarial contrastive learning framework to enhance neural network robustness simultaneously against adversarial attacks and common corruptions. By generating instance-wise adversarial examples and optimizing contrastive loss, our method fosters representations that resist adversarial perturbations and remain robust in real-world scenarios. Subsequent contrastive learning then strengthens the similarity between clean samples and their adversarial counterparts, fostering representations resistant to both adversarial attacks and common distortions. By focusing on improving performance under adversarial and real-world conditions, our approach aims to bolster the robustness of neural networks in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles navigating unpredictable weather conditions. We anticipate that this framework will contribute to advancing the reliability of neural networks in challenging environments, facilitating their widespread adoption in mission-critical scenarios.

> AI-powered systems have gained widespread popularity in various domains, including Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). However, ensuring their reliability and safety is challenging due to their complex nature. Conventional test adequacy metrics, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional software testing, are often insufficient or impractical for these systems. White-box metrics, which are specifically designed for these systems, leverage neuron coverage information. These coverage metrics necessitate access to the underlying AI model and training data, which may not always be available. Furthermore, the existing adequacy metrics exhibit weak correlations with the ability to detect faults in the generated test suite, creating a gap that we aim to bridge in this study.   In this paper, we introduce a set of black-box test adequacy metrics called "Test suite Instance Space Adequacy" (TISA) metrics, which can be used to gauge the effectiveness of a test suite. The TISA metrics offer a way to assess both the diversity and coverage of the test suite and the range of bugs detected during testing. Additionally, we introduce a framework that permits testers to visualise the diversity and coverage of the test suite in a two-dimensional space, facilitating the identification of areas that require improvement.   We evaluate the efficacy of the TISA metrics by examining their correlation with the number of bugs detected in system-level simulation testing of AVs. A strong correlation, coupled with the short computation time, indicates their effectiveness and efficiency in estimating the adequacy of testing AVs.

> Pre-trained language models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, code pre-trained model (PTM), which draw from the experiences of the NLP field, have also achieved state-of-the-art results in many software engineering (SE) downstream tasks. These code PTMs take into account the differences between programming languages and natural languages during pre-training and make adjustments to pre-training tasks and input data. However, researchers in the SE community still inherit habits from the NLP field when using these code PTMs to generate embeddings for SE downstream classification tasks, such as generating semantic embeddings for code snippets through special tokens and inputting code and text information in the same way as pre-training the PTMs. In this paper, we empirically study five different PTMs (i.e. CodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, CodeGPT and CodeGen) with three different architectures (i.e. encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder) on four SE downstream classification tasks (i.e. code vulnerability detection, code clone detection, just-in-time defect prediction and function docstring mismatch detection) with respect to the two aforementioned aspects. Our experimental results indicate that (1) regardless of the architecture of the code PTMs used, embeddings obtained through special tokens do not sufficiently aggregate the semantic information of the entire code snippet; (2) the quality of code embeddings obtained by combing code data and text data in the same way as pre-training the PTMs is poor and cannot guarantee richer semantic information; (3) using the method that aggregates the vector representations of all code tokens, the decoder-only PTMs can obtain code embeddings with semantics as rich as or even better quality than those obtained from the encoder-only and encoder-decoder PTMs.

> The prominent success of neural networks, mainly in computer vision tasks, is increasingly shadowed by their sensitivity to small, barely perceivable adversarial perturbations in image input.   In this work, we aim at explaining this vulnerability through the framework of sparsity.   We show the connection between adversarial attacks and sparse representations, with a focus on explaining the universality and transferability of adversarial examples in neural networks.   To this end, we show that sparse coding algorithms, and the neural network-based learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LISTA) among them, suffer from this sensitivity, and that common attacks on neural networks can be expressed as attacks on the sparse representation of the input image. The phenomenon that we observe holds true also when the network is agnostic to the sparse representation and dictionary, and thus can provide a possible explanation for the universality and transferability of adversarial attacks.   The code is available at https://github.com/danawr/adversarial_attacks_and_sparse_representations.

- *Zi Yin, Wei Ding, Jia Liu*

- `2311.08487v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08487v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08487v1)

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to a multitude of applications but struggle with significant risks, notably in generating harmful content and biases. Drawing an analogy to the human psyche's conflict between evolutionary survival instincts and societal norm adherence elucidated in Freud's psychoanalysis theory, we argue that LLMs suffer a similar fundamental conflict, arising between their inherent desire for syntactic and semantic continuity, established during the pre-training phase, and the post-training alignment with human values. This conflict renders LLMs vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein intensifying the models' desire for continuity can circumvent alignment efforts, resulting in the generation of harmful information. Through a series of experiments, we first validated the existence of the desire for continuity in LLMs, and further devised a straightforward yet powerful technique, such as incomplete sentences, negative priming, and cognitive dissonance scenarios, to demonstrate that even advanced LLMs struggle to prevent the generation of harmful information. In summary, our study uncovers the root of LLMs' vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, hereby questioning the efficacy of solely relying on sophisticated alignment methods, and further advocates for a new training idea that integrates modal concepts alongside traditional amodal concepts, aiming to endow LLMs with a more nuanced understanding of real-world contexts and ethical considerations.

> Recently, Yang et al. introduced an efficient searchable encryption scheme titled "Dynamic Consensus Committee-Based for Secure Data Sharing With Authorized Multi-Receiver Searchable Encryption (DCC-SE)," published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (DOI: 10.1109/TIFS.2023.3305183). According to the authors, DCC-SE meets various security requirements, especially the keyword trapdoor indistinguishability against chosen keyword attacks (KT-IND-CKA). In this letter, however, we reveal a significant vulnerability of DCC-SE: any users involved in the system can execute attacks against KT-IND-CKA security. This flaw potentially results in the unintended disclosure of sensitive keyword information related to the documents. We present a detailed cryptanalysis on DCC-SE. In addition, to address this vulnerability, we discuss the root cause and identify a flaw in the security proof of DCC-SE. Subsequently, we provide a solution that effectively addresses this concern without significantly increasing computational overhead.

> This paper introduces a novel approach to membership inference attacks (MIA) targeting stable diffusion computer vision models, specifically focusing on the highly sophisticated Stable Diffusion V2 by StabilityAI. MIAs aim to extract sensitive information about a model's training data, posing significant privacy concerns. Despite its advancements in image synthesis, our research reveals privacy vulnerabilities in the stable diffusion models' outputs. Exploiting this information, we devise a black-box MIA that only needs to query the victim model repeatedly. Our methodology involves observing the output of a stable diffusion model at different generative epochs and training a classification model to distinguish when a series of intermediates originated from a training sample or not. We propose numerous ways to measure the membership features and discuss what works best. The attack's efficacy is assessed using the ROC AUC method, demonstrating a 60\% success rate in inferring membership information. This paper contributes to the growing body of research on privacy and security in machine learning, highlighting the need for robust defenses against MIAs. Our findings prompt a reevaluation of the privacy implications of stable diffusion models, urging practitioners and developers to implement enhanced security measures to safeguard against such attacks.

> Static analysis is a widely used technique in software engineering for identifying and mitigating bugs. However, a significant hurdle lies in achieving a delicate balance between precision and scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, as recent advances demonstrate remarkable capabilities in comprehending, generating, and even debugging code. Yet, the logic of bugs can be complex and require sophisticated reasoning and a large analysis scope spanning multiple functions. Therefore, at this point, LLMs are better used in an assistive role to complement static analysis. In this paper, we take a deep dive into the open space of LLM-assisted static analysis, using use-before-initialization (UBI) bugs as a case study. To this end, we develop LLift, a fully automated framework that interfaces with both a static analysis tool and an LLM. By carefully designing the framework and the prompts, we are able to overcome a number of challenges, including bug-specific modeling, the large problem scope, the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, etc. Tested in a real-world scenario analyzing nearly a thousand potential UBI bugs produced by static analysis, LLift demonstrates a potent capability, showcasing a reasonable precision (50%) and appearing to have no missing bugs. It even identified 13 previously unknown UBI bugs in the Linux kernel. This research paves the way for new opportunities and methodologies in using LLMs for bug discovery in extensive, real-world datasets.

> Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) are a necessary component for cyber-services/infrastructures. Additionally, as cyberattacks follow a multi-domain attack surface, a similar defensive approach should be applied, namely, the use of an evolving multi-disciplinary solution that combines ITS, cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the increased popularity of AI solutions, due to Big Data use-case scenarios and decision support and automation scenarios, new opportunities to apply Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged, namely ITS empowerment. Using ML algorithms, an ITS can augment its intrusion tolerance capability, by learning from previous attacks and from known vulnerabilities. As such, this work's contribution is twofold: (1) an ITS architecture (Skynet) based on the state-of-the-art and incorporates new components to increase its intrusion tolerance capability and its adaptability to new adversaries; (2) an improved Risk Manager design that leverages AI to improve ITSs by automatically assessing OS risks to intrusions, and advise with safer configurations. One of the reasons that intrusions are successful is due to bad configurations or slow adaptability to new threats. This can be caused by the dependency that systems have for human intervention. One of the characteristics in Skynet and HAL 9000 design is the removal of human intervention. Being fully automatized lowers the chance of successful intrusions caused by human error. Our experiments using Skynet, shows that HAL is able to choose 15% safer configurations than the state-of-the-art risk manager.

> Ideal summarization models should generalize to novel summary-worthy content without remembering reference training summaries by rote. However, a single average performance score on the entire test set is inadequate in determining such model competencies. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol by partitioning a test set based on the lexical similarity of reference test summaries with training summaries. We observe up to a 5x (1.2x) difference in ROUGE-2 (entity recall) scores between the subsets with the lowest and highest similarity. Next, we show that such training repetitions also make a model vulnerable to rote learning, reproducing data artifacts such as factual errors, especially when reference test summaries are lexically close to training summaries. Consequently, we propose to limit lexical repetitions in training summaries during both supervised fine-tuning and likelihood calibration stages to improve the performance on novel test cases while retaining average performance. Our automatic and human evaluations on novel test subsets and recent news articles show that limiting lexical repetitions in training summaries can prevent rote learning and improve generalization.

> Deep neural network (DNN) models have become prevalent in edge devices for real-time inference. However, they are vulnerable to model extraction attacks and require protection. Existing defense approaches either fail to fully safeguard model confidentiality or result in significant latency issues. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents MirrorNet, which leverages Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to enable secure on-device DNN inference. It generates a TEE-friendly implementation for any given DNN model to protect the model confidentiality, while meeting the stringent computation and storage constraints of TEE. The framework consists of two key components: the backbone model (BackboneNet), which is stored in the normal world but achieves lower inference accuracy, and the Companion Partial Monitor (CPM), a lightweight mirrored branch stored in the secure world, preserving model confidentiality. During inference, the CPM monitors the intermediate results from the BackboneNet and rectifies the classification output to achieve higher accuracy. To enhance flexibility, MirrorNet incorporates two modules: the CPM Strategy Generator, which generates various protection strategies, and the Performance Emulator, which estimates the performance of each strategy and selects the most optimal one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MirrorNet in providing security guarantees while maintaining low computation latency, making MirrorNet a practical and promising solution for secure on-device DNN inference. For the evaluation, MirrorNet can achieve a 18.6% accuracy gap between authenticated and illegal use, while only introducing 0.99% hardware overhead.

> Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are deployed in many CPU designs because of the confidentiality and integrity guarantees they provide. ARM TrustZone is a TEE extensively deployed on smart phones, IoT devices, and notebooks. Specifically, TrustZone is used to separate code execution and data into two worlds, normal world and secure world. However, this separation inherently prevents traditional fuzzing approaches which rely upon coverage-guided feedback and existing fuzzing research is, therefore, extremely limited. In this paper, we present a native and generic method to perform efficient and scalable feedback-driven fuzzing on Trusted Applications (TAs) using ARM CoreSight. We propose LightEMU, a novel fuzzing framework that allows us to fuzz TAs by decoupling them from relied TEE. We argue that LightEMU is a promising first-stage approach for rapidly discovering TA vulnerabilities prior to investing effort in whole system TEE evaluation precisely because the majority of publicly disclosed TrustZone bugs reside in the TA code itself. We implement LightEMU and adapt it to Teegris, Trusty, OP-TEE and QSEE and evaluate 8 real-world TAs while triggering 3 unique crashes and achieving x10 time speedup when fuzzing TAs using the state-of-the-art TrustZone fuzzing framework.

> Despite a great deal of research, it is still not well-understood why trained neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this work we focus on two-layer neural networks trained using data which lie on a low dimensional linear subspace. We show that standard gradient methods lead to non-robust neural networks, namely, networks which have large gradients in directions orthogonal to the data subspace, and are susceptible to small adversarial $L_2$-perturbations in these directions. Moreover, we show that decreasing the initialization scale of the training algorithm, or adding $L_2$ regularization, can make the trained network more robust to adversarial perturbations orthogonal to the data.

> Neural networks have demonstrated significant accuracy across various domains, yet their vulnerability to subtle input alterations remains a persistent challenge. Conventional methods like data augmentation, while effective to some extent, fall short in addressing unforeseen corruptions, limiting the adaptability of neural networks in real-world scenarios. In response, this paper introduces a novel paradigm known as the Mixture of Class-Specific Expert Architecture. The approach involves disentangling feature learning for individual classes, offering a nuanced enhancement in scalability and overall performance. By training dedicated network segments for each class and subsequently aggregating their outputs, the proposed architecture aims to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with common neural network structures. The study underscores the importance of comprehensive evaluation methodologies, advocating for the incorporation of benchmarks like the common corruptions benchmark. This inclusion provides nuanced insights into the vulnerabilities of neural networks, especially concerning their generalization capabilities and robustness to unforeseen distortions. The research aligns with the broader objective of advancing the development of highly robust learning systems capable of nuanced reasoning across diverse and challenging real-world scenarios. Through this contribution, the paper aims to foster a deeper understanding of neural network limitations and proposes a practical approach to enhance their resilience in the face of evolving and unpredictable conditions.

> Rising device use and third-party IP integration in semiconductors raise security concerns. Unauthorized access, fault injection, and privacy invasion are potential threats from untrusted actors. Different security techniques have been proposed to provide resilience to secure devices from potential vulnerabilities; however, no one technique can be applied as an overarching solution. We propose an integrated Information Flow Tracking (IFT) technique to enable runtime security to protect system integrity by tracking the flow of data from untrusted communication channels. Existing hardware-based IFT schemes are either fine-, which are resource-intensive, or coarse-grained models, which have minimal precision logic, providing either control flow or data-flow integrity. No current security model provides multi-granularity due to the difficulty in balancing both the flexibility and hardware overheads at the same time. This study proposes a multi-level granularity IFT model that integrates a hardware-based IFT technique with a gate-level-based IFT (GLIFT) technique, along with flexibility, for better precision and assessments. Translation from the instruction level to the data level is based on module instantiation with security-critical data for accurate information flow behaviors without any false conservative flows. A simulation-based IFT model is demonstrated, which translates the architecture-specific extensions into a compiler-specific simulation model with toolchain extensions for Reduced Instruction Set Architecture (RISC-V) to verify the security extensions. This approach provides better precision logic by enhancing the tagged mechanism with 1-bit tags and implementing an optimized shadow logic that eliminates the area overhead by tracking the data for only security-critical modules.

> This research study is built upon cybersecurity audits and investigates the optimization of an Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 algorithm for Web Applications (WA) security audits using Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) processes. The study places particular emphasis on enhancing the VAPT process by optimizing the OWASP algorithm. To achieve this, the research utilizes desk documents to gain knowledge of WA cybersecurity audits and their associated tools. It also delves into archives to explore VAPT processes and identify techniques, methods, and tools for VAPT automation. Furthermore, the research proposes a prototype optimization that streamlines the two steps of VAPT using the OWASP Top 10 algorithm through an experimental procedure. The results are obtained within a virtual environment, which employs black box testing methods as the primary means of data acquisition and analysis. In this experimental setting, the OWASP algorithm demonstrates an impressive level of precision, achieving a precision rate exceeding 90%. It effectively covers all researched vulnerabilities, thus justifying its optimization. This research contributes significantly to the enhancement of the OWASP algorithm and benefits the offensive security community. It plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance processes for professionals and analysts in the security and software development fields.

> To address security vulnerabilities arising from third-party libraries, security researchers maintain databases monitoring and curating vulnerability reports. Application developers can identify vulnerable libraries by directly querying the databases with their used libraries. However, the querying results of vulnerable libraries are not reliable due to the incompleteness of vulnerability reports. Thus, current approaches model the task of identifying vulnerable libraries as a named-entity-recognition (NER) task or an extreme multi-label learning (XML) task. These approaches suffer from highly inaccurate results in identifying vulnerable libraries with complex and similar names, e.g., Java libraries. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose VulLibMiner, the first to identify vulnerable libraries from textual descriptions of both vulnerabilities and libraries, together with VulLib, a Java vulnerability dataset with their affected libraries. VulLibMiner consists of a TF-IDF matcher to efficiently screen out a small set of candidate libraries and a BERT-FNN model to identify vulnerable libraries from these candidates effectively. We evaluate VulLibMiner using four state-of-the-art/practice approaches of identifying vulnerable libraries on both their dataset named VeraJava and our VulLib dataset. Our evaluation results show that VulLibMiner can effectively identify vulnerable libraries with an average F1 score of 0.657 while the state-of-the-art/practice approaches achieve only 0.521.

> Regression testing activities greatly reduce the risk of faulty software release. However, the size of the test suites grows throughout the development process, resulting in time-consuming execution of the test suite and delayed feedback to the software development team. This has urged the need for approaches such as test case prioritization (TCP) and test-suite reduction to reach better results in case of limited resources. In this regard, proposing approaches that use auxiliary sources of data such as bug history can be interesting. We aim to propose an approach for TCP that takes into account test case coverage data, bug history, and test case diversification. To evaluate this approach we study its performance on real-world open-source projects. The bug history is used to estimate the fault-proneness of source code areas. The diversification of test cases is preserved by incorporating fault-proneness on a clustering-based approach scheme. The proposed methods are evaluated on datasets collected from the development history of five real-world projects including 357 versions in total. The experiments show that the proposed methods are superior to coverage-based TCP methods. The proposed approach shows that improvement of coverage-based and fault-proneness-based methods is possible by using a combination of diversification and fault-proneness incorporation.

> Continual learning algorithms are typically exposed to untrusted sources that contain training data inserted by adversaries and bad actors. An adversary can insert a small number of poisoned samples, such as mislabeled samples from previously learned tasks, or intentional adversarial perturbed samples, into the training datasets, which can drastically reduce the model's performance. In this work, we demonstrate that continual learning systems can be manipulated by malicious misinformation and present a new category of data poisoning attacks specific for continual learners, which we refer to as {\em Poisoning Attacks Against Continual Learners} (PACOL). The effectiveness of labeling flipping attacks inspires PACOL; however, PACOL produces attack samples that do not change the sample's label and produce an attack that causes catastrophic forgetting. A comprehensive set of experiments shows the vulnerability of commonly used generative replay and regularization-based continual learning approaches against attack methods. We evaluate the ability of label-flipping and a new adversarial poison attack, namely PACOL proposed in this work, to force the continual learning system to forget the knowledge of a learned task(s). More specifically, we compared the performance degradation of continual learning systems trained on benchmark data streams with and without poisoning attacks. Moreover, we discuss the stealthiness of the attacks in which we test the success rate of data sanitization defense and other outlier detection-based defenses for filtering out adversarial samples.

> The presence of bugs in video games can bring significant consequences for developers. To avoid these consequences, developers can leverage gameplay videos to identify and fix these bugs. Video hosting websites such as YouTube provide access to millions of game videos, including videos that depict bug occurrences, but the large amount of content can make finding bug instances challenging. We present an automated approach that uses machine learning to predict whether a segment of a gameplay video contains the depiction of a bug. We analyzed 4,412 segments of 198 gameplay videos to predict whether a segment contains an instance of a bug. Additionally, we investigated how our approach performs when applied across different specific genres of video games and on videos from the same game. We also analyzed the videos in the dataset to investigate what characteristics of the visual features might explain the classifier's prediction. Finally, we conducted a user study to examine the benefits of our automated approach against a manual analysis. Our findings indicate that our approach is effective at detecting segments of a video that contain bugs, achieving a high F1 score of 0.88, outperforming the current state-of-the-art technique for bug classification of gameplay video segments.

> In recent years, technology has advanced considerably with the introduction of many systems including advanced robotics, big data analytics, cloud computing, machine learning and many more. The opportunities to exploit the yet to come security that comes with these systems are going toe to toe with new releases of security protocols to combat this exploitation to provide a secure system. The digitization of our lives proves to solve our human problems as well as improve quality of life but because it is digitalized, information and technology could be misused for other malicious gains. Hackers aim to steal the data of innocent people to use it for other causes such as identity fraud, scams and many more. This issue can be corrected during the software development life cycle, integrating security across the development phases, and testing of the software is done early to reduce the number of vulnerabilities that might or might not heavily impact an organisation depending on the range of the attack. The goal of a secured system software is to prevent such exploitations from ever happening by conducting a system life cycle where through planning and testing is done to maximise security while maintaining functionality of the system. In this paper, we are going to discuss the recent trends in security for system development as well as our predictions and suggestions to improve the current security practices in this industry.

- `2311.11177v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11177v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11177v1)

> AI-powered code generation models have been developing rapidly, allowing developers to expedite code generation and thus improve their productivity. These models are trained on large corpora of code (primarily sourced from public repositories), which may contain bugs and vulnerabilities. Several concerns have been raised about the security of the code generated by these models. Recent studies have investigated security issues in AI-powered code generation tools such as GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer, revealing several security weaknesses in the code generated by these tools. As these tools evolve, it is expected that they will improve their security protocols to prevent the suggestion of insecure code to developers. This paper replicates the study of Pearce et al., which investigated security weaknesses in Copilot and uncovered several weaknesses in the code suggested by Copilot across diverse scenarios and languages (Python, C and Verilog). Our replication examines Copilot security weaknesses using newer versions of Copilot and CodeQL (the security analysis framework). The replication focused on the presence of security vulnerabilities in Python code. Our results indicate that, even with the improvements in newer versions of Copilot, the percentage of vulnerable code suggestions has reduced from 36.54% to 27.25%. Nonetheless, it remains evident that the model still suggests insecure code.

> Deep neural networks exhibit excellent performance in computer vision tasks, but their vulnerability to real-world adversarial attacks, achieved through physical objects that can corrupt their predictions, raises serious security concerns for their application in safety-critical domains. Existing defense methods focus on single-frame analysis and are characterized by high computational costs that limit their applicability in multi-frame scenarios, where real-time decisions are crucial.   To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-based defense mechanism that exploits adversarial channel-attention to quickly identify and track malicious objects in shallow network layers and mask their adversarial effects in a multi-frame setting. This work advances the state of the art by enhancing existing over-activation techniques for real-world adversarial attacks to make them usable in real-time applications. It also introduces an efficient multi-frame defense framework, validating its efficacy through extensive experiments aimed at evaluating both defense performance and computational cost.

> The past few years have witnessed a boom of miniapps, as lightweight applications, miniapps are of great importance in the mobile internet sector. Consequently, the security of miniapps can directly impact compromising the integrity of sensitive data, posing a potential threat to user privacy. However, after a thorough review of the various research efforts in miniapp security, we found that their actions in researching the safety of miniapp web interfaces are limited. This paper proposes a triad threat model focusing on users, servers and attackers to mitigate the security risk of miniapps. By following the principle of least privilege and the direction of permission consistency, we design a novel analysis framework for the security risk assessment of miniapps by this model. Then, we analyzed the correlation between the security risk assessment and the threat model associated with the miniapp. This analysis led to identifying potential scopes and categorisations with security risks. In the case study, we identify nine major categories of vulnerability issues, such as SQL injection, logical vulnerabilities and cross-site scripting. We also assessed a total of 50,628 security risk hazards and provided specific examples.

> In the field of Computer Science and Information Technology Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the emerging technologies. In IoT environment several devices are interconnected and transmit data among them. There may be some security vulnerability arise within the IoT environment. Till date, IoT has not been widely accepted due to its security flaws. Hence to keep the IoT environment most robust, we propose a stable security framework of IoT with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) using DNA Encoding. The ECC is most lightweight cryptography technique among other well known public key cryptography techniques. To increase encryption complexity, DNA encoding mechanism of DNA computing with ECC is preceded.

> Be it in the IoT or automotive domain, implicit certificates are gaining ever more prominence in constrained embedded devices. They present a resource-efficient security solution against common threat concerns. The computational requirements are not the main issue anymore. The focus is now placed on determining a good balance between the provided security level and the derived threat model. A security aspect that often gets overlooked is the establishment of secure communication sessions, as most design solutions are based only on the use of static key derivation, and therefore, lack the perfect forward secrecy. This leaves the transmitted data open for potential future exposures by having keys tied to the certificates rather than the communication sessions. We aim to patch this gap, by presenting a design that utilizes the Station to Station (STS) protocol with implicit certificates. In addition, we propose potential protocol optimization implementation steps and run a comprehensive study on the performance and security level between the proposed design and the state-of-the-art key derivation protocols. In our comparative study, we show that with a slight computational increase of 20\% compared to a static ECDSA key derivation, we are able to mitigate many session-related security vulnerabilities that would otherwise remain open.

> Machine learning is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker controls a small fraction of the training data and chooses that data with the goal of inducing some behavior unintended by the model developer in the trained model. We consider a realistic setting in which the adversary with the ability to insert a limited number of data points attempts to control the model's behavior on a specific subpopulation. Inspired by previous observations on disparate effectiveness of random label-flipping attacks on different subpopulations, we investigate the properties that can impact the effectiveness of state-of-the-art poisoning attacks against different subpopulations. For a family of 2-dimensional synthetic datasets, we empirically find that dataset separability plays a dominant role in subpopulation vulnerability for less separable datasets. However, well-separated datasets exhibit more dependence on individual subpopulation properties. We further discover that a crucial subpopulation property is captured by the difference in loss on the clean dataset between the clean model and a target model that misclassifies the subpopulation, and a subpopulation is much easier to attack if the loss difference is small. This property also generalizes to high-dimensional benchmark datasets. For the Adult benchmark dataset, we show that we can find semantically-meaningful subpopulation properties that are related to the susceptibilities of a selected group of subpopulations. The results in this paper are accompanied by a fully interactive web-based visualization of subpopulation poisoning attacks found at https://uvasrg.github.io/visualizing-poisoning

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial noise. Adversarial Training (AT) has been demonstrated to be the most effective defense strategy to protect neural networks from being fooled. However, we find AT omits to learning robust features, resulting in poor performance of adversarial robustness. To address this issue, we highlight two criteria of robust representation: (1) Exclusion: \emph{the feature of examples keeps away from that of other classes}; (2) Alignment: \emph{the feature of natural and corresponding adversarial examples is close to each other}. These motivate us to propose a generic framework of AT to gain robust representation, by the asymmetric negative contrast and reverse attention. Specifically, we design an asymmetric negative contrast based on predicted probabilities, to push away examples of different classes in the feature space. Moreover, we propose to weight feature by parameters of the linear classifier as the reverse attention, to obtain class-aware feature and pull close the feature of the same class. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets show our methods greatly advance the robustness of AT and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

> Replaying past experiences has proven to be a highly effective approach for averting catastrophic forgetting in supervised continual learning. However, some crucial factors are still largely ignored, making it vulnerable to serious failure, when used as a solution to forgetting in continual reinforcement learning, even in the context of perfect memory where all data of previous tasks are accessible in the current task. On the one hand, since most reinforcement learning algorithms are not invariant to the reward scale, the previously well-learned tasks (with high rewards) may appear to be more salient to the current learning process than the current task (with small initial rewards). This causes the agent to concentrate on those salient tasks at the expense of generality on the current task. On the other hand, offline learning on replayed tasks while learning a new task may induce a distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy on old tasks, resulting in forgetting. In this paper, we introduce RECALL, a replay-enhanced method that greatly improves the plasticity of existing replay-based methods on new tasks while effectively avoiding the recurrence of catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning. RECALL leverages adaptive normalization on approximate targets and policy distillation on old tasks to enhance generality and stability, respectively. Extensive experiments on the Continual World benchmark show that RECALL performs significantly better than purely perfect memory replay, and achieves comparable or better overall performance against state-of-the-art continual learning methods.

> Digitalization enables the automation required to operate modern cyber-physical energy systems (CPESs), leading to a shift from hierarchical to organic systems. However, digitalization increases the number of factors affecting the state of a CPES (e.g., software bugs and cyber threats). In addition to established factors like functional correctness, others like security become relevant but are yet to be integrated into an operational viewpoint, i.e. a holistic perspective on the system state. Trust in organic computing is an approach to gain a holistic view of the state of systems. It consists of several facets (e.g., functional correctness, security, and reliability), which can be used to assess the state of CPES. Therefore, a trust assessment on all levels can contribute to a coherent state assessment. This paper focuses on the trust in ICT-enabled grid services in a CPES. These are essential for operating the CPES, and their performance relies on various data aspects like availability, timeliness, and correctness. This paper proposes to assess the trust in involved components and data to estimate data correctness, which is crucial for grid services. The assessment is presented considering two exemplary grid services, namely state estimation and coordinated voltage control. Furthermore, the interpretation of different trust facets is also discussed.

> A less complex and more straightforward program is a crucial factor that enhances its maintainability and makes writing secure and bug-free programs easier. However, due to its heavy workload and the risks of breaking the working programs, programmers are reluctant to do code refactoring, and thus, it also causes the loss of potential learning experiences. To mitigate this, we demonstrate the application of using a large language model (LLM), GPT-3.5, to suggest less complex versions of the user-written Python program, aiming to encourage users to learn how to write better programs. We propose a method to leverage the prompting with few-shot examples of the LLM by selecting the best-suited code refactoring examples for each target programming problem based on the prior evaluation of prompting with the one-shot example. The quantitative evaluation shows that 95.68% of programs can be refactored by generating 10 candidates each, resulting in a 17.35% reduction in the average cyclomatic complexity and a 25.84% decrease in the average number of lines after filtering only generated programs that are semantically correct. Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation shows outstanding capability in code formatting, while unnecessary behaviors such as deleting or translating comments are also observed.

> The use of free and open source software (FOSS) components in all software systems is estimated to be above 90%. With such high usage and because of the heterogeneity of FOSS tools, repositories, developers and ecosystem, the level of complexity of managing software development has also increased. This has amplified both the attack surface for malicious actors and the difficulty of making sure that the software products are free from threats. The rise of security incidents involving high profile attacks is evidence that there is still much to be done to safeguard software products and the FOSS supply chain. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools and the study of attack trees help with improving security. However, they still lack the ability to comprehensively address how interactions within the software supply chain may impact security. This work presents a novel approach of assessing threat levels in FOSS supply chains with the log model. This model provides information capture and threat propagation analysis that not only account for security risks that may be caused by attacks and the usage of vulnerable software, but also how they interact with the other elements to affect the threat level for any element in the model.

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different domains.

> Deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly pre-trained language models (PLMs), have been revealed to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, the adversarial examples generated by many mainstream word-level adversarial attack models are neither valid nor natural, leading to the loss of semantic maintenance, grammaticality, and human imperceptibility. Based on the exceptional capacity of language understanding and generation of large language models (LLMs), we propose LLM-Attack, which aims at generating both valid and natural adversarial examples with LLMs. The method consists of two stages: word importance ranking (which searches for the most vulnerable words) and word synonym replacement (which substitutes them with their synonyms obtained from LLMs). Experimental results on the Movie Review (MR), IMDB, and Yelp Review Polarity datasets against the baseline adversarial attack models illustrate the effectiveness of LLM-Attack, and it outperforms the baselines in human and GPT-4 evaluation by a significant margin. The model can generate adversarial examples that are typically valid and natural, with the preservation of semantic meaning, grammaticality, and human imperceptibility.

> Greybox fuzzing is a scalable and practical approach for software testing. Most greybox fuzzing tools are coverage-guided as reaching high code coverage is more likely to find bugs. However, since most covered codes may not contain bugs, blindly extending code coverage is less efficient, especially for corner cases. Unlike coverage-guided greybox fuzzing which increases code coverage in an undirected manner, directed greybox fuzzing (DGF) spends most of its time allocation on reaching specific targets (e.g., the bug-prone zone) without wasting resources stressing unrelated parts. Thus, DGF is particularly suitable for scenarios such as patch testing,bug reproduction, and special bug detection. For now, DGF has become an active research area. However, DGF has general limitations and challenges that are worth further studying. Based on the investigation of 42 state-of-the-art fuzzers that are closely related to DGF, we conduct the first in-depth study to summarize the empirical evidence on the research progress of DGF. This paper studies DGF from a broader view, which takes into account not only the location-directed type that targets specific code parts, but also the behavior-directed type that aims to expose abnormal program behaviors. By analyzing the benefits and limitations of DGF research, we try to identify gaps in current research, meanwhile, reveal new research opportunities, and suggest areas for further investigation.

> Attack paths are the potential chain of malicious activities an attacker performs to compromise network assets and acquire privileges through exploiting network vulnerabilities. Attack path analysis helps organizations to identify new/unknown chains of attack vectors that reach critical assets within the network, as opposed to individual attack vectors in signature-based attack analysis. Timely identification of attack paths enables proactive mitigation of threats. Nevertheless, manual analysis of complex network configurations, vulnerabilities, and security events to identify attack paths is rarely feasible. This work proposes a novel transferable graph neural network-based model for shortest path identification. The proposed shortest path detection approach, integrated with a novel holistic and comprehensive model for identifying potential network vulnerabilities interactions, is then utilized to detect network attack paths. Our framework automates the risk assessment of attack paths indicating the propensity of the paths to enable the compromise of highly-critical assets (e.g., databases) given the network configuration, assets' criticality, and the severity of the vulnerabilities in-path to the asset. The proposed framework, named SPGNN-API, incorporates automated threat mitigation through a proactive timely tuning of the network firewall rules and zero-trust policies to break critical attack paths and bolster cyber defenses. Our evaluation process is twofold; evaluating the performance of the shortest path identification and assessing the attack path detection accuracy. Our results show that SPGNN-API largely outperforms the baseline model for shortest path identification with an average accuracy >= 95% and successfully detects 100% of the potentially compromised assets, outperforming the attack graph baseline by 47%.

> While graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performances in many real-world tasks including graph classification and node classification, recent works have demonstrated they are also extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Most previous works have focused on attacking node classification networks under impractical white-box scenarios. In this work, we will propose a non-targeted Hard Label Black Box Node Injection Attack on Graph Neural Networks, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind. Under this setting, more real world tasks can be studied because our attack assumes no prior knowledge about (1): the model architecture of the GNN we are attacking; (2): the model's gradients; (3): the output logits of the target GNN model. Our attack is based on an existing edge perturbation attack, from which we restrict the optimization process to formulate a node injection attack. In the work, we will evaluate the performance of the attack using three datasets, COIL-DEL, IMDB-BINARY, and NCI1.

> The Deep Leakage from Gradient (DLG) attack has emerged as a prevalent and highly effective method for extracting sensitive training data by inspecting exchanged gradients. This approach poses a substantial threat to the privacy of individuals and organizations alike. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the gradient leakage method when applied specifically to transformer-based models. Through meticulous examination, we showcase the capability to accurately recover data solely from gradients and rigorously investigate the conditions under which gradient attacks can be executed, providing compelling evidence. Furthermore, we reevaluate the approach of introducing additional noise on gradients as a protective measure against gradient attacks. To address this, we outline a theoretical proof that analyzes the associated privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Additionally, we affirm the convergence of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm under perturbed gradients. The primary objective of this study is to augment the understanding of gradient leakage attack and defense strategies while actively contributing to the development of privacy-preserving techniques specifically tailored for transformer-based models. By shedding light on the vulnerabilities and countermeasures associated with gradient leakage, this research aims to foster advancements in safeguarding sensitive data and upholding privacy in the context of transformer-based models.

The paper also raises pertinent research questions for future studies of manipulation in the context of algorithmic transparency.

> Modern large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for coding tasks including writing and reasoning about code. They improve upon previous neural network models of code, such as code2seq or seq2seq, that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities. However, these previous code models were shown vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program's semantics, such as the inclusion of "dead code" through false conditions or the addition of inconsequential print statements, designed to "fool" the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations but a detailed study on this concern has been lacking so far. In this paper we aim to investigate the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs. In particular, we study the transferability of adversarial examples, generated through white-box attacks on smaller code models, to LLMs. Furthermore, to make the LLMs more robust against such adversaries without incurring the cost of retraining, we propose prompt-based defenses that involve modifying the prompt to include additional information such as examples of adversarially perturbed code and explicit instructions for reversing adversarial perturbations. Our experiments show that adversarial examples obtained with a smaller code model are indeed transferable, weakening the LLMs' performance. The proposed defenses show promise in improving the model's resilience, paving the way to more robust defensive solutions for LLMs in code-related applications.

> Quality Assurance (QA) is a critical component in product development, particularly in software testing. Despite the evolution of automated methods, testing for REST APIs often involves repetitive tasks. A significant portion of resources is dedicated more to scripting tests than to detecting and resolving actual software bugs. Additionally, conventional testing methods frequently struggle to adapt to software updates. However, with advancements in data science, a new paradigm is emerging: a self-reliant testing framework. This innovative approach minimizes the need for user intervention, achieving level 2 of autonomy in executing REST API testing procedures. It does so by employing a clustering method and analysis on logs categorizing test cases efficiently and thereby streamlining the testing process as well as ensuring more dynamic adaptability to software changes. Nirikshak is publicly available as an open-source software for the community at https://github.com/yashmahalwal/nirikshak.

> These days, deep learning models have achieved great success in multiple fields, from autonomous driving to medical diagnosis. These models have expanded the abilities of artificial intelligence by offering great solutions to complex problems that were very difficult to solve earlier. In spite of their unseen success in various, it has been identified, through research conducted, that deep learning models can be subjected to various attacks that compromise model security and data privacy of the Deep Neural Network models. Deep learning models can be subjected to various attacks at different stages of their lifecycle. During the testing phase, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities through different kinds of attacks such as Model Extraction Attacks, Model Inversion attacks, and Adversarial attacks. Model Extraction Attacks are aimed at reverse-engineering a trained deep learning model, with the primary objective of revealing its architecture and parameters. Model inversion attacks aim to compromise the privacy of the data used in the Deep learning model. These attacks are done to compromise the confidentiality of the model by going through the sensitive training data from the model's predictions. By analyzing the model's responses, attackers aim to reconstruct sensitive information. In this way, the model's data privacy is compromised. Adversarial attacks, mainly employed on computer vision models, are made to corrupt models into confidently making incorrect predictions through malicious testing data. These attacks subtly alter the input data, making it look normal but misleading deep learning models to make incorrect decisions. Such attacks can happen during both the model's evaluation and training phases. Data Poisoning Attacks add harmful data to the training set, disrupting the learning process and reducing the reliability of the deep learning mode.

> The construction industry in Australia is characterized by its intricate supply chains and vulnerability to myriad risks. As such, effective supply chain risk management (SCRM) becomes imperative. This paper employs different transformer models, and train for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the context of Australian construction SCRM. Utilizing NER, transformer models identify and classify specific risk-associated entities in news articles, offering a detailed insight into supply chain vulnerabilities. By analysing news articles through different transformer models, we can extract relevant entities and insights related to specific risk taxonomies local (milieu) to the Australian construction landscape. This research emphasises the potential of NLP-driven solutions, like transformer models, in revolutionising SCRM for construction in geo-media specific contexts.

> In this study, we investigate the emerging threat of inaudible acoustic attacks targeting digital voice assistants, a critical concern given their projected prevalence to exceed the global population by 2024. Our research extends the feasibility of these attacks across various platforms like Amazon's Alexa, Android, iOS, and Cortana, revealing significant vulnerabilities in smart devices. The twelve attack vectors identified include successful manipulation of smart home devices and automotive systems, potential breaches in military communication, and challenges in critical infrastructure security. We quantitatively show that attack success rates hover around 60%, with the ability to activate devices remotely from over 100 feet away. Additionally, these attacks threaten critical infrastructure, emphasizing the need for multifaceted defensive strategies combining acoustic shielding, advanced signal processing, machine learning, and robust user authentication to mitigate these risks.

> Screening prioritisation in medical systematic reviews aims to rank the set of documents retrieved by complex Boolean queries. Prioritising the most important documents ensures that subsequent review steps can be carried out more efficiently and effectively. The current state of the art uses the final title of the review as a query to rank the documents using BERT-based neural rankers. However, the final title is only formulated at the end of the review process, which makes this approach impractical as it relies on ex post facto information. At the time of screening, only a rough working title is available, with which the BERT-based ranker performs significantly worse than with the final title. In this paper, we explore alternative sources of queries for prioritising screening, such as the Boolean query used to retrieve the documents to be screened and queries generated by instruction-based generative large-scale language models such as ChatGPT and Alpaca. Our best approach is not only viable based on the information available at the time of screening, but also has similar effectiveness to the final title.

- `2311.07553v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07553v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07553v2)

> Transformer-based pre-trained models of code (PTMC) have been widely utilized and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many mission-critical applications. However, they can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks through identifier substitution or coding style transformation, which can significantly degrade accuracy and may further incur security concerns. Although several approaches have been proposed to generate adversarial examples for PTMC, the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches, especially on different code intelligence tasks, has not been well understood. To bridge this gap, this study systematically analyzes five state-of-the-art adversarial attack approaches from three perspectives: effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of generated examples. The results show that none of the five approaches balances all these perspectives. Particularly, approaches with a high attack success rate tend to be time-consuming; the adversarial code they generate often lack naturalness, and vice versa. To address this limitation, we explore the impact of perturbing identifiers under different contexts and find that identifier substitution within for and if statements is the most effective. Based on these findings, we propose a new approach that prioritizes different types of statements for various tasks and further utilizes beam search to generate adversarial examples. Evaluation results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art ALERT in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency while preserving the naturalness of the generated adversarial examples.

> CLIP is a widely used foundational vision-language model that is used for zero-shot image recognition and other image-text alignment tasks. We demonstrate that CLIP is vulnerable to change in image quality under compression. This surprising result is further analysed using an attribution method-Integrated Gradients. Using this attribution method, we are able to better understand both quantitatively and qualitatively exactly the nature in which the compression affects the zero-shot recognition accuracy of this model. We evaluate this extensively on CIFAR-10 and STL-10. Our work provides the basis to understand this vulnerability of CLIP and can help us develop more effective methods to improve the robustness of CLIP and other vision-language models.

> When individuals are subject to adverse outcomes from machine learning models, providing a recourse path to help achieve a positive outcome is desirable. Recent work has shown that counterfactual explanations - which can be used as a means of single-step recourse - are vulnerable to privacy issues, putting an individuals' privacy at risk. Providing a sequential multi-step path for recourse can amplify this risk. Furthermore, simply adding noise to recourse paths found from existing methods can impact the realism and actionability of the path for an end-user. In this work, we address privacy issues when generating realistic recourse paths based on instance-based counterfactual explanations, and provide PrivRecourse: an end-to-end privacy preserving pipeline that can provide realistic recourse paths. PrivRecourse uses differentially private (DP) clustering to represent non-overlapping subsets of the private dataset. These DP cluster centers are then used to generate recourse paths by forming a graph with cluster centers as the nodes, so that we can generate realistic - feasible and actionable - recourse paths. We empirically evaluate our approach on finance datasets and compare it to simply adding noise to data instances, and to using DP synthetic data, to generate the graph. We observe that PrivRecourse can provide paths that are private and realistic.

> Biometric authentication is becoming more prevalent for secured authentication systems. However, the biometric substances can be deceived by the imposters in several ways. Among other imposter attacks, print attacks, mask attacks, and replay attacks fall under the presentation attack category. The bio-metric images, especially the iris and face, are vulnerable to different presentation attacks. This research applies deep learning approaches to mitigate presentation attacks in a biometric access control system. Our contribution in this paper is two-fold: First, we applied the wavelet transform to extract the features from the biometric images. Second, we modified the deep residual neural net and applied it to the spoof datasets in an attempt to detect the presentation attacks. This research applied the proposed approach to biometric spoof datasets, namely ATVS, CASIA two class, and CASIA cropped image sets. The datasets used in this research contain images that are captured in both a controlled and uncontrolled environment along with different resolutions and sizes. We obtained the best accuracy of 93% on the ATVS Iris datasets. For CASIA two class and CASIA cropped datasets, we achieved test accuracies of 91% and 82%, respectively.

> Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images), which accounts for higher "credibility" than text-only news pieces. Although existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and cross-modal approach (\textbf{RDCM}) for multi-modal misinformation detection. It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module. We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available). Evaluation results on two public multi-modal misinformation detection datasets (Pheme and Twitter Datasets) evince the superiority of the proposed model. The formal implementation of this paper can be found in this link: https://github.com/less-and-less-bugs/RDCM

> Despite efforts to align large language models to produce harmless responses, they are still vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that elicit unrestricted behaviour. In this work, we investigate persona modulation as a black-box jailbreaking method to steer a target model to take on personalities that are willing to comply with harmful instructions. Rather than manually crafting prompts for each persona, we automate the generation of jailbreaks using a language model assistant. We demonstrate a range of harmful completions made possible by persona modulation, including detailed instructions for synthesising methamphetamine, building a bomb, and laundering money. These automated attacks achieve a harmful completion rate of 42.5% in GPT-4, which is 185 times larger than before modulation (0.23%). These prompts also transfer to Claude 2 and Vicuna with harmful completion rates of 61.0% and 35.9%, respectively. Our work reveals yet another vulnerability in commercial large language models and highlights the need for more comprehensive safeguards.

> As the complexities of processors keep increasing, the task of effectively verifying their integrity and security becomes ever more daunting. The intricate web of instructions, microarchitectural features, and interdependencies woven into modern processors pose a formidable challenge for even the most diligent verification and security engineers. To tackle this growing concern, recently, researchers have developed fuzzing techniques explicitly tailored for hardware processors. However, a prevailing issue with these hardware fuzzers is their heavy reliance on static strategies to make decisions in their algorithms. To address this problem, we develop a novel dynamic and adaptive decision-making framework, MABFuzz, that uses multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms to fuzz processors. MABFuzz is agnostic to, and hence, applicable to, any existing hardware fuzzer. In the process of designing MABFuzz, we encounter challenges related to the compatibility of MAB algorithms with fuzzers and maximizing their efficacy for fuzzing. We overcome these challenges by modifying the fuzzing process and tailoring MAB algorithms to accommodate special requirements for hardware fuzzing.   We integrate three widely used MAB algorithms in a state-of-the-art hardware fuzzer and evaluate them on three popular RISC-V-based processors. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of MABFuzz to cover a broader spectrum of processors' intricate landscapes and doing so with remarkable efficiency. In particular, MABFuzz achieves up to 308x speedup in detecting vulnerabilities and up to 5x speedup in achieving coverage compared to a state-of-the-art technique.

> Establishing a secure connection between wireless devices has become significantly important with the increasing number of Wi-Fi products coming to the market. In order to provide an easy and secure pairing standard, the Wi-Fi Alliance has designed the Wi-Fi Protected Setup. Push-Button Configuration (PBC) is part of this standard and is especially useful for pairing devices with physical limitations. However, PBC is proven to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Tamper-Evident Pairing (TEP) is an improvement of the PBC standard, which aims to fix the MITM vulnerability without interfering the useful properties of PBC. It relies on the Tamper-Evident Announcement (TEA), which guarantees that an adversary can neither tamper a transmitted message without being detected, nor hide the fact that the message has been sent. The security properties of TEP were proven manually by its authors and tested with the Uppaal and Spin model checkers. During the Uppaal model checking, no vulnerabilities were found. However, the Spin model revealed a case, in which the TEP's security is not guaranteed. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the TEP protocol, including all information needed to understand how it works. Furthermore, we summarize the security checks performed on it, give the circumstances, under which it is no longer resistant to MITM attacks and explain the reasons why they could not be revealed with the first model. Nevertheless, future work is required to gain full certainty of the TEP's security before applying it in the industry.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in instruction-following, becoming increasingly crucial across various applications. However, this capability brings with it the risk of prompt injection attacks, where attackers inject instructions into LLMs' input to elicit undesirable actions or content. Understanding the robustness of LLMs against such attacks is vital for their safe implementation. In this work, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of instruction-following LLMs against prompt injection attacks. Our objective is to determine the extent to which LLMs can be influenced by injected instructions and their ability to differentiate between these injected and original target instructions. Through extensive experiments with leading instruction-following LLMs, we uncover significant vulnerabilities in their robustness to such attacks. Our results indicate that some models are overly tuned to follow any embedded instructions in the prompt, overly focusing on the latter parts of the prompt without fully grasping the entire context. By contrast, models with a better grasp of the context and instruction-following capabilities will potentially be more susceptible to compromise by injected instructions. This underscores the need to shift the focus from merely enhancing LLMs' instruction-following capabilities to improving their overall comprehension of prompts and discernment of instructions that are appropriate to follow. We hope our in-depth analysis offers insights into the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities, aiding in the development of future solutions.

> Model adaptation aims at solving the domain transfer problem under the constraint of only accessing the pretrained source models. With the increasing considerations of data privacy and transmission efficiency, this paradigm has been gaining recent popularity. This paper studies the vulnerability to universal attacks transferred from the source domain during model adaptation algorithms due to the existence of malicious providers. We explore both universal adversarial perturbations and backdoor attacks as loopholes on the source side and discover that they still survive in the target models after adaptation. To address this issue, we propose a model preprocessing framework, named AdaptGuard, to improve the security of model adaptation algorithms. AdaptGuard avoids direct use of the risky source parameters through knowledge distillation and utilizes the pseudo adversarial samples under adjusted radius to enhance the robustness. AdaptGuard is a plug-and-play module that requires neither robust pretrained models nor any changes for the following model adaptation algorithms. Extensive results on three commonly used datasets and two popular adaptation methods validate that AdaptGuard can effectively defend against universal attacks and maintain clean accuracy in the target domain simultaneously. We hope this research will shed light on the safety and robustness of transfer learning. Code is available at https://github.com/TomSheng21/AdaptGuard.

While the number of deployed IoT devices continues to increase exponentially, they still present severe cyber-security vulnerabilities. Effective authentication is paramount to support trustworthy IIoT communications, however, current solutions focus on upper-layer identity verification or key-based cryptography which are often inadequate to the heterogeneous IIoT environment.

> Identifying and resolving logic errors can be one of the most frustrating challenges for novices programmers. Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler or interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain conditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior -- in other cases, the issue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors can be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed by automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically detecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for novices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising performance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining code. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with the next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors relate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to analysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly explanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of introductory computing students $(n=964)$ solving the same error detection task. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we observe significant improvement in logic error identification between the previous and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations significantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be integrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for supporting students when learning programming.

> This review paper takes a comprehensive look at malicious attacks against FL, categorizing them from new perspectives on attack origins and targets, and providing insights into their methodology and impact. In this survey, we focus on threat models targeting the learning process of FL systems. Based on the source and target of the attack, we categorize existing threat models into four types, Data to Model (D2M), Model to Data (M2D), Model to Model (M2M) and composite attacks. For each attack type, we discuss the defense strategies proposed, highlighting their effectiveness, assumptions and potential areas for improvement. Defense strategies have evolved from using a singular metric to excluding malicious clients, to employing a multifaceted approach examining client models at various phases. In this survey paper, our research indicates that the to-learn data, the learning gradients, and the learned model at different stages all can be manipulated to initiate malicious attacks that range from undermining model performance, reconstructing private local data, and to inserting backdoors. We have also seen these threat are becoming more insidious. While earlier studies typically amplified malicious gradients, recent endeavors subtly alter the least significant weights in local models to bypass defense measures. This literature review provides a holistic understanding of the current FL threat landscape and highlights the importance of developing robust, efficient, and privacy-preserving defenses to ensure the safe and trusted adoption of FL in real-world applications.

> Derivative training is a known method that significantly improves the accuracy of neural networks in some low-dimensional applications. In this paper, a similar improvement is obtained for an image analysis problem: reconstructing the vertices of a cube from its image. By training the derivatives with respect to the 6 degrees of freedom of the cube, we obtain 25 times more accurate results for noiseless inputs. The derivatives also offer insight into the robustness problem, which is currently understood in terms of two types of network vulnerabilities. The first type involves small perturbations that dramatically change the output, and the second type relates to substantial image changes that the network erroneously ignores. Defense against each is possible, but safeguarding against both while maintaining the accuracy defies conventional training methods. The first type is analyzed using the network's gradient, while the second relies on human input evaluation, serving as an oracle substitute. For the task at hand, the nearest neighbor oracle can be defined and expanded into Taylor series using image derivatives. This allows for a robustness analysis that unifies both types of vulnerabilities and enables training where accuracy and universal robustness are limited only by network capacity.

> Numerous open-source and commercial malware detectors are available. However, their efficacy is threatened by new adversarial attacks, whereby malware attempts to evade detection, e.g., by performing feature-space manipulation. In this work, we propose an explainability-guided and model-agnostic testing framework for robustness of malware detectors when confronted with adversarial attacks. The framework introduces the concept of Accrued Malicious Magnitude (AMM) to identify which malware features could be manipulated to maximize the likelihood of evading detection. We then use this framework to test several state-of-the-art malware detectors' abilities to detect manipulated malware. We find that (i) commercial antivirus engines are vulnerable to AMM-guided test cases; (ii) the ability of a manipulated malware generated using one detector to evade detection by another detector (i.e., transferability) depends on the overlap of features with large AMM values between the different detectors; and (iii) AMM values effectively measure the fragility of features (i.e., capability of feature-space manipulation to flip the prediction results) and explain the robustness of malware detectors facing evasion attacks. Our findings shed light on the limitations of current malware detectors, as well as how they can be improved.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in artificial intelligence (AI) fields. However, DNN models can be easily illegally copied, redistributed, or abused by criminals, seriously damaging the interests of model inventors. The copyright protection of DNN models by neural network watermarking has been studied, but the establishment of a traceability mechanism for determining the authorized users of a leaked model is a new problem driven by the demand for AI services. Because the existing traceability mechanisms are used for models without watermarks, a small number of false-positives are generated. Existing black-box active protection schemes have loose authorization control and are vulnerable to forgery attacks. Therefore, based on the idea of black-box neural network watermarking with the video framing and image perceptual hash algorithm, a passive copyright protection and traceability framework PCPT is proposed that uses an additional class of DNN models, improving the existing traceability mechanism that yields a small number of false-positives. Based on an authorization control strategy and image perceptual hash algorithm, a DNN model active copyright protection and traceability framework ACPT is proposed. This framework uses the authorization control center constructed by the detector and verifier. This approach realizes stricter authorization control, which establishes a strong connection between users and model owners, improves the framework security, and supports traceability verification.

> Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in test data. To defend against adversarial attacks, probabilistic classifiers have been proposed as an alternative to deterministic ones. However, literature has conflicting findings on the effectiveness of probabilistic classifiers in comparison to deterministic ones. In this paper, we clarify the role of randomization in building adversarially robust classifiers. Given a base hypothesis set of deterministic classifiers, we show the conditions under which a randomized ensemble outperforms the hypothesis set in adversarial risk, extending previous results. Additionally, we show that for any probabilistic binary classifier (including randomized ensembles), there exists a deterministic classifier that outperforms it. Finally, we give an explicit description of the deterministic hypothesis set that contains such a deterministic classifier for many types of commonly used probabilistic classifiers, i.e. randomized ensembles and parametric/input noise injection.

> Game development has become an extremely competitive multi-billion-dollar industry. Many games fail even after years of development efforts because of game-breaking bugs that disrupt the game-play and ruin the player experience. The goal of this work is to provide a bug taxonomy for games that will help game developers in developing bug-resistant games, game testers in designing and executing fault-finding test cases, and researchers in evaluating game testing approaches. For this purpose, we performed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) by analyzing 436 sources, out of which 189 (78 academic and 111 grey) sources reporting bugs encountered in the game development industry were selected for analysis. We validate the proposed taxonomy by conducting a survey involving different game industry practitioners. The MLR allowed us to finalize a detailed taxonomy of 63 game bug categories in end-user perspective including eight first-tier categories: Gaming Balance, Implementation Response, Network, Sound, Temporal, Unexpected Crash, Navigational, and Non-Temporal faults. We observed that manual approaches towards game testing are still widely used. Only one of the approaches targets sound bugs whereas game balancing and how to incorporate machine learning in game testing is trending in the recent literature. Most of the game testing techniques are specialized and dependent on specific platforms.

> Internet of Things (IoT) devices pose significant security challenges due to their heterogeneity (i.e., hardware and software) and vulnerability to extensive attack surfaces. Today's conventional perimeter-based systems use credential-based authentication (e.g., username/password, certificates, etc.) to decide whether an actor can access a network. However, the verification process occurs only at the system's perimeter because most IoT devices lack robust security measures due to their limited hardware and software capabilities, making them highly vulnerable. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach based on Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) extended with blockchain to further enhance security. The blockchain component serves as an immutable database for storing users' requests and is used to verify trustworthiness by analyzing and identifying potentially malicious user activities. We discuss the framework, processes of the approach, and the experiments carried out on a testbed to validate its feasibility and applicability in the smart city context. Lastly, the evaluation focuses on non-functional properties such as performance, scalability, and complexity.

> Cyberattacks are increasingly threatening networked systems, often with the emergence of new types of unknown (zero-day) attacks and the rise of vulnerable devices. Such attacks can also target multiple components of a Supply Chain, which can be protected via Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, the need to learn large amounts of labelled data often limits the applicability of ML-based IDSs to cybersystems that only have access to private local data, while distributed systems such as Supply Chains have multiple components, each of which must preserve its private data while being targeted by the same attack To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Decentralized and Online Federated Learning Intrusion Detection (DOF-ID) architecture based on the G-Network model with collaborative learning, that allows each IDS used by a specific component to learn from the experience gained in other components, in addition to its own local data, without violating the data privacy of other components. The performance evaluation results using public Kitsune and Bot-IoT datasets show that DOF-ID significantly improves the intrusion detection performance in all of the collaborating components, with acceptable computation time for online learning.

> Recent advancements in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) have been driven by transformer-based models. OCR systems are critical in numerous high-stakes domains, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attack remains largely uncharted territory, raising concerns about security and compliance with emerging AI regulations. In this work we present a novel framework to assess the resilience of Transformer-based OCR (TrOCR) models. We develop and assess algorithms for both targeted and untargeted attacks. For the untargeted case, we measure the Character Error Rate (CER), while for the targeted case we use the success ratio. We find that TrOCR is highly vulnerable to untargeted attacks and somewhat less vulnerable to targeted attacks. On a benchmark handwriting data set, untargeted attacks can cause a CER of more than 1 without being noticeable to the eye. With a similar perturbation size, targeted attacks can lead to success rates of around $25\%$ -- here we attacked single tokens, requiring TrOCR to output the tenth most likely token from a large vocabulary.

> Managing access between large numbers of distributed medical devices has become a crucial aspect of modern healthcare systems, enabling the establishment of smart hospitals and telehealth infrastructure. However, as telehealth technology continues to evolve and Internet of Things (IoT) devices become more widely used, they are also becoming increasingly exposed to various types of vulnerabilities and medical errors. In healthcare information systems, about 90\% of vulnerabilities emerged from misuse cases and human errors. As a result, there is a need for additional research and development of security tools to prevent such attacks. This article proposes a zero-trust-based context-aware framework for managing access to the main components of the cloud ecosystem, including users, devices and output data. The main goal and benefit of the proposed framework is to build a scoring system to prevent or alleviate misuse cases while using distributed medical devices in cloud-based healthcare information systems. The framework has two main scoring schemas to maintain the chain of trust. First, it proposes a critical trust score based on cloud-native micro-services of authentication, encryption, logging, and authorizations. Second, creating a bond trust scoring to assess the real-time semantic and syntactic analysis of attributes stored in a healthcare information system. The analysis is based on a pre-trained machine learning model to generate the semantic and syntactic scores. The framework also takes into account regulatory compliance and user consent to create a scoring system. The advantage of this method is that it is applicable to any language and adapts to all attributes as it relies on a language model, not just a set of predefined and limited attributes. The results show a high F1 score of 93.5%, which proves that it is valid for detecting misuse cases.

> Face recognition (FR) technology plays a crucial role in various applications, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant security concerns. Existing research primarily focuses on transferability to different FR models, overlooking the direct transferability to victim's face images, which is a practical threat in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel adversarial attack method that considers both the transferability to the FR model and the victim's face image, called NeRFTAP. Leveraging NeRF-based 3D-GAN, we generate new view face images for the source and target subjects to enhance transferability of adversarial patches. We introduce a style consistency loss to ensure the visual similarity between the adversarial UV map and the target UV map under a 0-1 mask, enhancing the effectiveness and naturalness of the generated adversarial face images. Extensive experiments and evaluations on various FR models demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing attack techniques. Our work provides valuable insights for enhancing the robustness of FR systems in practical adversarial settings.

> Face recognition (FR) systems powered by deep learning have become widely used in various applications. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially those based on local adversarial patches that can be physically applied to real-world objects. In this paper, we propose RADAP, a robust and adaptive defense mechanism against diverse adversarial patches in both closed-set and open-set FR systems. RADAP employs innovative techniques, such as FCutout and F-patch, which use Fourier space sampling masks to improve the occlusion robustness of the FR model and the performance of the patch segmenter. Moreover, we introduce an edge-aware binary cross-entropy (EBCE) loss function to enhance the accuracy of patch detection. We also present the split and fill (SAF) strategy, which is designed to counter the vulnerability of the patch segmenter to complete white-box adaptive attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of RADAP, which shows significant improvements in defense performance against various adversarial patches, while maintaining clean accuracy higher than that of the undefended Vanilla model.

> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as the service backend for LLM-integrated applications such as code completion and AI-powered search. LLM-integrated applications serve as middleware to refine users' queries with domain-specific knowledge to better inform LLMs and enhance the responses. Despite numerous opportunities and benefits, LLM-integrated applications also introduce new attack surfaces. Understanding, minimizing, and eliminating these emerging attack surfaces is a new area of research. In this work, we consider a setup where the user and LLM interact via an LLM-integrated application in the middle. We focus on the communication rounds that begin with user's queries and end with LLM-integrated application returning responses to the queries, powered by LLMs at the service backend. For this query-response protocol, we identify potential vulnerabilities that can originate from the malicious application developer or from an outsider threat initiator that is able to control the database access, manipulate and poison data that are high-risk for the user. Successful exploits of the identified vulnerabilities result in the users receiving responses tailored to the intent of a threat initiator. We assess such threats against LLM-integrated applications empowered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Our empirical results show that the threats can effectively bypass the restrictions and moderation policies of OpenAI, resulting in users receiving responses that contain bias, toxic content, privacy risk, and disinformation. To mitigate those threats, we identify and define four key properties, namely integrity, source identification, attack detectability, and utility preservation, that need to be satisfied by a safe LLM-integrated application. Based on these properties, we develop a lightweight, threat-agnostic defense that mitigates both insider and outsider threats.

> Network Address Translation (NAT) plays an essential role in shielding devices inside an internal local area network from direct malicious accesses from the public Internet. However, recent studies show the possibilities of penetrating NAT boxes in some specific circumstances. The penetrated NAT box can be exploited by attackers as a pivot to abuse the otherwise inaccessible internal network resources, leading to serious security consequences. In this paper, we aim to conduct an Internet-wide penetration testing on NAT boxes. The main difference between our study and the previous ones is that ours is based on the TCP/IP side channels. We explore the TCP/IP side channels in the research literature, and find that the shared-IPID side channel is the most suitable for NAT-penetration testing, as it satisfies the three requirements of our study: generality, ethics, and robustness. Based on this side channel, we develop an adaptive scanner that can accomplish the Internet-wide scanning in 5 days in a very non-aggressive manner. The evaluation shows that our scanner is effective in both the controlled network and the real network. Our measurement results reveal that more than 30,000 network middleboxes are potentially vulnerable to NAT penetration. They are distributed across 154 countries and 4,146 different organizations, showing that NAT-penetration poses a serious security threat.

> Prompt-based learning has been widely applied in many low-resource NLP tasks such as few-shot scenarios. However, this paradigm has been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most of the existing attack methods focus on inserting manually predefined templates as triggers in the pre-training phase to train the victim model and utilize the same triggers in the downstream task to perform inference, which tends to ignore the transferability and stealthiness of the templates. In this work, we propose a novel approach of TARGET (Template-trAnsfeRable backdoor attack aGainst prompt-basEd NLP models via GPT4), which is a data-independent attack method. Specifically, we first utilize GPT4 to reformulate manual templates to generate tone-strong and normal templates, and the former are injected into the model as a backdoor trigger in the pre-training phase. Then, we not only directly employ the above templates in the downstream task, but also use GPT4 to generate templates with similar tone to the above templates to carry out transferable attacks. Finally we have conducted extensive experiments on five NLP datasets and three BERT series models, with experimental results justifying that our TARGET method has better attack performance and stealthiness compared to the two-external baseline methods on direct attacks, and in addition achieves satisfactory attack capability in the unseen tone-similar templates.

> Despite the remarkable advances that have been made in continual learning, the adversarial vulnerability of such methods has not been fully discussed. We delve into the adversarial robustness of memory-based continual learning algorithms and observe limited robustness improvement by directly applying adversarial training techniques. Preliminary studies reveal the twin challenges for building adversarial robust continual learners: accelerated forgetting in continual learning and gradient obfuscation in adversarial robustness. In this study, we put forward a novel adversarial robust memory-based continual learner that adjusts data logits to mitigate the forgetting of pasts caused by adversarial samples. Furthermore, we devise a gradient-based data selection mechanism to overcome the gradient obfuscation caused by limited stored data. The proposed approach can widely integrate with existing memory-based continual learning as well as adversarial training algorithms in a plug-and-play way. Extensive experiments on Split-CIFAR10/100 and Split-Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8.13% higher accuracy for adversarial data.

> The task of deepfakes detection is far from being solved by speech or vision researchers. Several publicly available databases of fake synthetic video and speech were built to aid the development of detection methods. However, existing databases typically focus on visual or voice modalities and provide no proof that their deepfakes can in fact impersonate any real person. In this paper, we present the first realistic audio-visual database of deepfakes SWAN-DF, where lips and speech are well synchronized and video have high visual and audio qualities. We took the publicly available SWAN dataset of real videos with different identities to create audio-visual deepfakes using several models from DeepFaceLab and blending techniques for face swapping and HiFiVC, DiffVC, YourTTS, and FreeVC models for voice conversion. From the publicly available speech dataset LibriTTS, we also created a separate database of only audio deepfakes LibriTTS-DF using several latest text to speech methods: YourTTS, Adaspeech, and TorToiSe. We demonstrate the vulnerability of a state of the art speaker recognition system, such as ECAPA-TDNN-based model from SpeechBrain, to the synthetic voices. Similarly, we tested face recognition system based on the MobileFaceNet architecture to several variants of our visual deepfakes. The vulnerability assessment show that by tuning the existing pretrained deepfake models to specific identities, one can successfully spoof the face and speaker recognition systems in more than 90% of the time and achieve a very realistic looking and sounding fake video of a given person.

> Being able to identify functions of interest in cross-architecture software is useful whether you are analysing for malware, securing the software supply chain or conducting vulnerability research. Cross-Architecture Binary Code Similarity Search has been explored in numerous studies and has used a wide range of different data sources to achieve its goals. The data sources typically used draw on common structures derived from binaries such as function control flow graphs or binary level call graphs, the output of the disassembly process or the outputs of a dynamic analysis approach. One data source which has received less attention is binary intermediate representations. Binary Intermediate representations possess two interesting properties: they are cross architecture by their very nature and encode the semantics of a function explicitly to support downstream usage. Within this paper we propose Function as a String Encoded Representation (FASER) which combines long document transformers with the use of intermediate representations to create a model capable of cross architecture function search without the need for manual feature engineering, pre-training or a dynamic analysis step. We compare our approach against a series of baseline approaches for two tasks; A general function search task and a targeted vulnerability search task. Our approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, performing better than all baseline approaches.

> Psychological stress detection is an important task for mental healthcare research, but there has been little prior work investigating the effectiveness of psychological stress models on minority individuals, who are especially vulnerable to poor mental health outcomes. In this work, we use the related task of minority stress detection to evaluate the ability of psychological stress models to understand the language of sexual and gender minorities. We find that traditional psychological stress models underperform on minority stress detection, and we propose using emotion-infused models to reduce that performance disparity. We further demonstrate that multi-task psychological stress models outperform the current state-of-the-art for minority stress detection without directly training on minority stress data. We provide explanatory analysis showing that minority communities have different distributions of emotions than the general population and that emotion-infused models improve the performance of stress models on underrepresented groups because of their effectiveness in low-data environments, and we propose that integrating emotions may benefit underrepresented groups in other mental health detection tasks.

> Context: Bug-fix pattern detection has been investigated in the past in the context of classical software. However, while quantum software is developing rapidly, the literature still lacks automated methods and tools to identify, analyze, and detect bug-fix patterns. To the best of our knowledge, our work previously published in SEKE'23 was the first to leverage classical techniques to detect bug-fix patterns in quantum code.   Objective: To extend our previous effort, we present a research agenda (Q-Repair), including a series of testing and debugging methodologies, to improve the quality of quantum software. The ultimate goal is to utilize machine learning techniques to automatically predict fix patterns for existing quantum bugs.   Method: As part of the first stage of the agenda, we extend our initial study and propose a more comprehensive automated framework, called Q-PAC, for detecting bug-fix patterns in IBM Qiskit quantum code. In the framework, we develop seven bug-fix pattern detectors using abstract syntax trees, syntactic filters, and semantic checks.   Results: To demonstrate our method, we run Q-PAC on a variety of quantum bug-fix patterns using both real-world and handcrafted examples of bugs and fixes. The experimental results show that Q-PAC can effectively identify bug-fix patterns in IBM Qiskit.   Conclusion: We hope our initial study on quantum bug-fix detection can bring awareness of quantum software engineering to both researchers and practitioners. Thus, we also publish Q-PAC as an open-source software on GitHub. We would like to encourage other researchers to work on research directions (such as Q-Repair) to improve the quality of the quantum programming.

> Self-play is a technique for machine learning in multi-agent systems where a learning algorithm learns by interacting with copies of itself. Self-play is useful for generating large quantities of data for learning, but has the drawback that the agents the learner will face post-training may have dramatically different behavior than the learner came to expect by interacting with itself. For the special case of two-player constant-sum games, self-play that reaches Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to produce strategies that perform well against any post-training opponent; however, no such guarantee exists for multiplayer games. We show that in games that approximately decompose into a set of two-player constant-sum games (called constant-sum polymatrix games) where global $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria are boundedly far from Nash equilibria in each subgame (called subgame stability), any no-external-regret algorithm that learns by self-play will produce a strategy with bounded vulnerability. For the first time, our results identify a structural property of multiplayer games that enable performance guarantees for the strategies produced by a broad class of self-play algorithms. We demonstrate our findings through experiments on Leduc poker.

However, current approaches for protecting client data in outsourced computing fall short: use of cryptographic techniques like fully-homomorphic encryption incurs substantial costs, whereas use of hardware-assisted trusted execution environments has been shown to be vulnerable to run-time and side-channel attacks.   We present Blinded Memory (BliMe), an architecture to realize efficient and secure outsourced computation. BliMe consists of a novel and minimal set of instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions implementing a taint-tracking policy to ensure the confidentiality of client data even in the presence of server vulnerabilities. To secure outsourced computation, the BliMe extensions can be used together with an attestable, fixed-function hardware security module (HSM) and an encryption engine that provides atomic decrypt-and-taint and encrypt-and-untaint operations. Clients rely on remote attestation and key agreement with the HSM to ensure that their data can be transferred securely to and from the encryption engine and will always be protected by BliMe's taint-tracking policy while at the server.   We provide an RTL implementation BliMe-BOOM based on the BOOM RISC-V core. BliMe-BOOM requires no reduction in clock frequency relative to unmodified BOOM, and has minimal power ($<\!1.5\%$) and FPGA resource ($\leq\!9.0\%$) overheads. Various implementations of BliMe incur only moderate performance overhead ($8--25\%$). We also provide a machine-checked security proof of a simplified model ISA with BliMe extensions.

> An innovative strategy to enhance the security of symmetric substitution ciphers is presented, through the implementation of a randomized key matrix suitable for various file formats, including but not limited to binary and text files. Despite their historical relevance, symmetric substitution ciphers have been limited by vulnerabilities to cryptanalytic methods like frequency analysis and known plaintext attacks. The aim of our research is to mitigate these vulnerabilities by employing a polyalphabetic substitution strategy that incorporates a distinct randomized key matrix. This matrix plays a pivotal role in generating a unique random key, comprising characters, encompassing both uppercase and lowercase letters, numeric, and special characters, to derive the corresponding ciphertext. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology in enhancing the security of conventional substitution methods for file encryption and decryption is supported by comprehensive testing and analysis, which encompass computational speed, frequency analysis, keyspace examination, Kasiski test, entropy analysis, and the utilization of a large language model.

> Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a widely used protocol that enables two parties to securely compute a function over the intersected part of their shared datasets and has been a significant research focus over the years. However, recent studies have highlighted its vulnerability to Set Membership Inference Attacks (SMIA), where an adversary might deduce an individual's membership by invoking multiple PSI protocols. This presents a considerable risk, even in the most stringent versions of PSI, which only return the cardinality of the intersection. This paper explores the evaluation of anonymity within the PSI context. Initially, we highlight the reasons why existing works fall short in measuring privacy leakage, and subsequently propose two attack strategies that address these deficiencies. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of our proposed methods. In addition to these, we illustrate how the integration of auxiliary information, such as the sum of payloads associated with members of the intersection (PSI-SUM), can enhance attack efficiency. We conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of various attack strategies proposed utilizing two real datasets. Our findings indicate that the methods we propose markedly enhance attack efficiency when contrasted with previous research endeavors. {The effective attacking implies that depending solely on existing PSI protocols may not provide an adequate level of privacy assurance. It is recommended to combine privacy-enhancing technologies synergistically to enhance privacy protection even further.

> Temperature sampling is a conventional approach to diversify large language model predictions. As temperature increases, the prediction becomes diverse but also vulnerable to hallucinations -- generating tokens that are sensible but not factual. One common approach to mitigate hallucinations is to provide source/grounding documents and the model is trained to produce predictions that bind to and are attributable to the provided source. It appears that there is a trade-off between diversity and attribution. To mitigate any such trade-off, we propose to relax the constraint of having a fixed temperature over decoding steps, and a mechanism to guide the dynamic temperature according to its relevance to the source through KL-divergence. Our experiments justifies the trade-off, and shows that our sampling algorithm outperforms the conventional top-k and top-p algorithms in conversational question-answering and summarization tasks.

> Transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT, have been widely adopted in natural language processing (NLP) due to their exceptional performance. However, recent studies show their vulnerability to textual adversarial attacks where the model's output can be misled by intentionally manipulating the text inputs. Despite various methods that have been proposed to enhance the model's robustness and mitigate this vulnerability, many require heavy consumption resources (e.g., adversarial training) or only provide limited protection (e.g., defensive dropout). In this paper, we propose a novel method called dynamic attention, tailored for the transformer architecture, to enhance the inherent robustness of the model itself against various adversarial attacks. Our method requires no downstream task knowledge and does not incur additional costs. The proposed dynamic attention consists of two modules: (I) attention rectification, which masks or weakens the attention value of the chosen tokens, and (ii) dynamic modeling, which dynamically builds the set of candidate tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic attention significantly mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks, improving up to 33\% better performance than previous methods against widely-used adversarial attacks. The model-level design of dynamic attention enables it to be easily combined with other defense methods (e.g., adversarial training) to further enhance the model's robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dynamic attention preserves the state-of-the-art robustness space of the original model compared to other dynamic modeling methods.

> The emergence of quantum computing has introduced unprecedented security challenges to conventional cryptographic systems, particularly in the domain of optical communications. This research addresses these challenges by innovatively combining quantum key distribution (QKD), specifically the E91 protocol, with logistic chaotic maps to establish a secure image transmission scheme. Our approach utilizes the unpredictability of chaotic systems alongside the robust security mechanisms inherent in quantum entanglement. The scheme is further fortified with an eavesdropping detection mechanism based on CHSH inequality, thereby enhancing its resilience against unauthorized access. Through quantitative simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme in encrypting images, achieving high entropy and sensitivity to the original images. The results indicate a significant improvement in encryption and decryption efficiency, showcasing the potential of the scheme as a viable solution against the vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing advancements. Our research offers a novel perspective in secure optical communications, blending the principles of chaos theory with QKD to create a more robust cryptographic framework.

> Though LLMs are capable of generating plausible programs, it's challenging to interact with the LLMs further to revise the program, especially if the user's specific requirements are different from the initial proposal. In this paper, we introduce ANPL, an interactive programming system that ensures users can always refine the generated code towards their specific programmatic intents via structured decompositions. Borrowing the paradigm of sketching from program synthesis, an ANPL program consists of a set of input-outputs that it must satisfy, a ``sketch'' -- control/data flow expressed in precise code (e.g. Python), and ``holes'' -- sub-modules to be implemented by the LLM specified with natural language. The user revises an ANPL program by either modifying the sketch, changing the language used to describe the holes, or providing additional input-outputs to a particular hole, turning it into a sub-ANPL program that can be solved recursively. This workflow allows the users to offload programming burdens to the LLM as much as possible while retaining the ability to pinpoint and resolve bugs locally, without exposing the rest of the program to the LLM. We deploy ANPL on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a set of unique tasks that are challenging for state-of-the-art AI systems, showing it outperforms baseline programming systems that (a) without the ability to decompose tasks interactively and (b) without the guarantee that the modules can be correctly composed together. Additional evaluations on APPS, HumanEval, and real-world programming tasks have validated that the ANPL framework is applicable to multiple programming domains. We release the ANPL solutions to the ARC tasks as a dataset, providing insights into how humans decompose novel tasks programmatically. See our code at https://iprc-dip.github.io/ANPL/.

> Adversarial patches exemplify the tangible manifestation of the threat posed by adversarial attacks on Machine Learning (ML) models in real-world scenarios. Robustness against these attacks is of the utmost importance when designing computer vision applications, especially for safety-critical domains such as CCTV systems. In most practical situations, monitoring open spaces requires multi-view systems to overcome acquisition challenges such as occlusion handling. Multiview object systems are able to combine data from multiple views, and reach reliable detection results even in difficult environments. Despite its importance in real-world vision applications, the vulnerability of multiview systems to adversarial patches is not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we raise the following question: Does the increased performance and information sharing across views offer as a by-product robustness to adversarial patches? We first conduct a preliminary analysis showing promising robustness against off-the-shelf adversarial patches, even in an extreme setting where we consider patches applied to all views by all persons in Wildtrack benchmark. However, we challenged this observation by proposing two new attacks: (i) In the first attack, targeting a multiview CNN, we maximize the global loss by proposing gradient projection to the different views and aggregating the obtained local gradients. (ii) In the second attack, we focus on a Transformer-based multiview framework. In addition to the focal loss, we also maximize the transformer-specific loss by dissipating its attention blocks. Our results show a large degradation in the detection performance of victim multiview systems with our first patch attack reaching an attack success rate of 73% , while our second proposed attack reduced the performance of its target detector by 62%

> Bug reports are an essential aspect of software development, and it is crucial to identify and resolve them quickly to ensure the consistent functioning of software systems. Retrieving similar bug reports from an existing database can help reduce the time and effort required to resolve bugs. In this paper, we compared the effectiveness of semantic textual similarity methods for retrieving similar bug reports based on a similarity score. We explored several embedding models such as TF-IDF (Baseline), FastText, Gensim, BERT, and ADA. We used the Software Defects Data containing bug reports for various software projects to evaluate the performance of these models. Our experimental results showed that BERT generally outperformed the rest of the models regarding recall, followed by ADA, Gensim, FastText, and TFIDF. Our study provides insights into the effectiveness of different embedding methods for retrieving similar bug reports and highlights the impact of selecting the appropriate one for this task.

> Large language models of code (Code-LLMs) have recently brought tremendous advances to code completion, a fundamental feature of programming assistance and code intelligence. However, most existing works ignore the possible presence of bugs in the code context for generation, which are inevitable in software development. Therefore, we introduce and study the buggy-code completion problem, inspired by the realistic scenario of real-time code suggestion where the code context contains potential bugs -- anti-patterns that can become bugs in the completed program. To systematically study the task, we introduce two datasets: one with synthetic bugs derived from semantics-altering operator changes (buggy-HumanEval) and one with realistic bugs derived from user submissions to coding problems (buggy-FixEval). We find that the presence of potential bugs significantly degrades the generation performance of the high-performing Code-LLMs. For instance, the passing rates of CODEGEN-2B-MONO on test cases of buggy-HumanEval drop more than 50% given a single potential bug in the context. Finally, we investigate several post-hoc methods for mitigating the adverse effect of potential bugs and find that there remains a significant gap in post-mitigation performance.

> Decentralized training of large language models has emerged as an effective way to democratize this technology. However, the potential threats associated with this approach have not been carefully discussed, which would hinder the development of decentralized training infrastructures. This paper aims to initiate discussion towards this end by exploring the robustness of decentralized training from three main perspectives. First, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities inherent in decentralized training frameworks in terms of hardware, data, and models. Second, we highlight the fundamental difference between decentralized foundation model training and vanilla federated learning, where the security techniques employed in federated learning cannot be applied directly. Third, we discuss the essential components required for a robust and efficient decentralized training framework and present a case study by modeling a concrete threat model. Our objective in this vision paper is to emphasize the importance of addressing security concerns in the context of decentralized training for large language models.

> With the rise in using immature smart contract programming languages to build a decentralized application, more vulnerabilities have been introduced to the Blockchain and were the main reasons behind critical financial losses. Moreover, the immutability of Blockchain technology makes deployed smart contracts unfixable for the whole life of the Blockchain itself. The lack of complete and up-to-date resources that explain those vulnerabilities in detail has also contributed to increasing the number of vulnerabilities in Blockchain. In addition, the lack of a standardized nomination of the existing vulnerabilities has made redundant research and made developers more confused. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the most complete list of smart contract vulnerabilities that exist in the most popular Blockchains with a detailed explanation of each one of them. In addition, we propose a new codification system that facilitates the communication of those vulnerabilities between developers and researchers. This codification, help identify the most uncovered vulnerabilities to focus on in future research. Moreover, the discussed list of vulnerabilities covers multiple Blockchain and could be used for even future built Blockchains.

> In this paper, we focus on mean-field variational Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and explore the representation capacity of such BNNs by investigating which types of concepts are less likely to be encoded by the BNN. It has been observed and studied that a relatively small set of interactive concepts usually emerge in the knowledge representation of a sufficiently-trained neural network, and such concepts can faithfully explain the network output. Based on this, our study proves that compared to standard deep neural networks (DNNs), it is less likely for BNNs to encode complex concepts. Experiments verify our theoretical proofs. Note that the tendency to encode less complex concepts does not necessarily imply weak representation power, considering that complex concepts exhibit low generalization power and high adversarial vulnerability.

Actors exhibited clear preferences for scanning buckets that appeared to belong to organizations, especially commercial entities in the technology sector with a vulnerability disclosure program. Actors continuously engaged with the content of buckets by downloading, uploading, and deleting files. Most alarmingly, we recorded multiple instances in which malicious actors downloaded, read, and understood a document from our honeybucket, leading them to attempt to gain unauthorized server access.

> The impact of AI models on marginalized communities has traditionally been measured by identifying performance differences between specified demographic subgroups. Though this approach aims to center vulnerable groups, it risks obscuring patterns of harm faced by intersectional subgroups or shared across multiple groups. To address this, we draw on theories of marginalization from disability studies and related disciplines, which state that people farther from the norm face greater adversity, to consider the "margins" in the domain of toxicity detection. We operationalize the "margins" of a dataset by employing outlier detection to identify text about people with demographic attributes distant from the "norm". We find that model performance is consistently worse for demographic outliers, with mean squared error (MSE) between outliers and non-outliers up to 70.4% worse across toxicity types. It is also worse for text outliers, with a MSE up to 68.4% higher for outliers than non-outliers. We also find text and demographic outliers to be particularly susceptible to errors in the classification of severe toxicity and identity attacks. Compared to analysis of disparities using traditional demographic breakdowns, we find that our outlier analysis frequently surfaces greater harms faced by a larger, more intersectional group, which suggests that outlier analysis is particularly beneficial for identifying harms against those groups.

> We explore security aspects of a new computing paradigm that combines novel memristors and traditional Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) to construct a highly efficient analog and/or digital fabric that is especially well-suited to Machine Learning (ML) inference processors for Radio Frequency (RF) signals. Memristors have different properties than traditional CMOS which can potentially be exploited by attackers. In addition, the mixed signal approximate computing model has different vulnerabilities than traditional digital implementations. However both the memristor and the ML computation can be leveraged to create security mechanisms and countermeasures ranging from lightweight cryptography, identifiers (e.g. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), fingerprints, and watermarks), entropy sources, hardware obfuscation and leakage/attack detection methods. Three different threat models are proposed: 1) Supply Chain, 2) Physical Attacks, and 3) Remote Attacks. For each threat model, potential vulnerabilities and defenses are identified. This survey reviews a variety of recent work from the hardware and ML security literature and proposes open problems for both attack and defense. The survey emphasizes the growing area of RF signal analysis and identification in terms of the commercial space, as well as military applications and threat models. We differ from other other recent surveys that target ML in general, neglecting RF applications.

> Preventing abusive activities caused by adversaries accessing online services at a rate exceeding that expected by websites has become an ever-increasing problem. CAPTCHAs and SMS authentication are widely used to provide a solution by implementing rate limiting, although they are becoming less effective, and some are considered privacy-invasive. In light of this, many studies have proposed better rate-limiting systems that protect the privacy of legitimate users while blocking malicious actors. However, they suffer from one or more shortcomings: (1) assume trust in the underlying hardware and (2) are vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Motivated by the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes Scrappy: SeCure Rate Assuring Protocol with PrivacY. Scrappy allows clients to generate unforgeable yet unlinkable rate-assuring proofs, which provides the server with cryptographic guarantees that the client is not misbehaving. We design Scrappy using a combination of DAA and hardware security devices. Scrappy is implemented over three types of devices, including one that can immediately be deployed in the real world. Our baseline evaluation shows that the end-to-end latency of Scrappy is minimal, taking only 0.32 seconds, and uses only 679 bytes of bandwidth when transferring necessary data. We also conduct an extensive security evaluation, showing that the rate-limiting capability of Scrappy is unaffected even if the hardware security device is compromised.

> The security of microcontrollers, which drive modern IoT and embedded devices, continues to raise major concerns. Within a microcontroller (MCU), the firmware is a monolithic piece of software that contains the whole software stack, whereas a variety of peripherals represent the hardware. As MCU firmware contains vulnerabilities, it is ideal to test firmware with off-the-shelf software testing techniques, such as dynamic symbolic execution and fuzzing. Nevertheless, no emulator can emulate the diverse MCU peripherals or execute/test the firmware. Specifically, the interrupt interface, among all I/O interfaces used by MCU peripherals, is extremely challenging to emulate.   In this paper, we present AIM -- a generic, scalable, and hardware-independent dynamic firmware analysis framework that supports unemulated MCU peripherals by a novel interrupt modeling mechanism. AIM effectively and efficiently covers interrupt-dependent code in firmware by a novel, firmware-guided, Just-in-Time Interrupt Firing technique. We implemented our framework in angr and performed dynamic symbolic execution for eight real-world MCU firmware. According to testing results, our framework covered up to 11.2 times more interrupt-dependent code than state-of-the-art approaches while accomplishing several challenging goals not feasible previously. Finally, a comparison with a state-of-the-art firmware fuzzer demonstrates dynamic symbolic execution and fuzzing together can achieve better firmware testing coverage.

> Satellite systems are facing an ever-increasing amount of cybersecurity threats as their role in communications, navigation, and other services expands. Recent papers have examined attacks targeting satellites and space systems; however, they did not comprehensively analyze the threats to satellites and systematically identify adversarial techniques across the attack lifecycle. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures explicitly targeting LEO satellites. First, we analyze the space ecosystem including the ground, space, Communication, and user segments, highlighting their architectures, functions, and vulnerabilities. Then, we examine the threat landscape, including adversary types, and capabilities, and survey historical and recent attacks such as jamming, spoofing, and supply chain. Finally, we propose a novel extension of the MITRE ATT&CK framework to categorize satellite attack techniques across the adversary lifecycle from reconnaissance to impact. The taxonomy is demonstrated by modeling high-profile incidents, including the Viasat attack that disrupted Ukraine's communications. The taxonomy provides the foundation for the development of defenses against emerging cyber risks to space assets. The proposed threat model will advance research in the space domain and contribute to the security of the space domain against sophisticated attacks.

> Deep learning vulnerability detection tools are increasing in popularity and have been shown to be effective. These tools rely on large volume of high quality training data, which are very hard to get. Most of the currently available datasets provide function-level labels, reporting whether a function is vulnerable or not vulnerable. However, for a vulnerability detection to be useful, we need to also know the lines that are relevant to the vulnerability. This paper makes efforts towards developing systematic tools and proposes. ActiveClean to generate the large volume of line-level vulnerability data from commits. That is, in addition to function-level labels, it also reports which lines in the function are likely responsible for vulnerability detection. In the past, static analysis has been applied to clean commits to generate line-level data. Our approach based on active learning, which is easy to use and scalable, provide a complementary approach to static analysis. We designed semantic and syntactic properties from commit lines and use them to train the model. We evaluated our approach on both Java and C datasets processing more than 4.3K commits and 119K commit lines. AcitveClean achieved an F1 score between 70-74. Further, we also show that active learning is effective by using just 400 training data to reach F1 score of 70.23. Using ActiveClean, we generate the line-level labels for the entire FFMpeg project in the Devign dataset, including 5K functions, and also detected incorrect function-level labels. We demonstrated that using our cleaned data, LineVul, a SOTA line-level vulnerability detection tool, detected 70 more vulnerable lines and 18 more vulnerable functions, and improved Top 10 accuracy from 66% to 73%.

> Deep learning based methods for medical images can be easily compromised by adversarial examples (AEs), posing a great security flaw in clinical decision-making. It has been discovered that conventional adversarial attacks like PGD which optimize the classification logits, are easy to distinguish in the feature space, resulting in accurate reactive defenses. To better understand this phenomenon and reassess the reliability of the reactive defenses for medical AEs, we thoroughly investigate the characteristic of conventional medical AEs. Specifically, we first theoretically prove that conventional adversarial attacks change the outputs by continuously optimizing vulnerable features in a fixed direction, thereby leading to outlier representations in the feature space. Then, a stress test is conducted to reveal the vulnerability of medical images, by comparing with natural images. Interestingly, this vulnerability is a double-edged sword, which can be exploited to hide AEs. We then propose a simple-yet-effective hierarchical feature constraint (HFC), a novel add-on to conventional white-box attacks, which assists to hide the adversarial feature in the target feature distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on three medical datasets, both 2D and 3D, with different modalities. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HFC, \emph{i.e.,} it bypasses an array of state-of-the-art adversarial medical AE detectors more efficiently than competing adaptive attacks, which reveals the deficiencies of medical reactive defense and allows to develop more robust defenses in future.

> 5G networks are susceptible to cyber attacks due to reasons such as implementation issues and vulnerabilities in 3GPP standard specifications. In this work, we propose lateral movement strategies in a 5G Core (5GC) with network slicing enabled, as part of a larger attack campaign by well-resourced adversaries such as APT groups. Further, we present 5GLatte, a system to detect such malicious lateral movement. 5GLatte operates on a host-container access graph built using host/NF container logs collected from the 5GC. Paths inferred from the access graph are scored based on selected filtering criteria and subsequently presented as input to a threshold-based anomaly detection algorithm to reveal malicious lateral movement paths. We evaluate 5GLatte on a dataset containing attack campaigns (based on MITRE ATT&CK and FiGHT frameworks) launched in a 5G test environment which shows that compared to other lateral movement detectors based on state-of-the-art, it can achieve higher true positive rates with similar false positive rates.

> With the proliferation of social media, there has been a sharp increase in offensive content, particularly targeting vulnerable groups, exacerbating social problems such as hatred, racism, and sexism. Detecting offensive language use is crucial to prevent offensive language from being widely shared on social media. However, the accurate detection of irony, implication, and various forms of hate speech on social media remains a challenge. Natural language-based deep learning models require extensive training with large, comprehensive, and labeled datasets. Unfortunately, manually creating such datasets is both costly and error-prone. Additionally, the presence of human-bias in offensive language datasets is a major concern for deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a linguistic data augmentation approach to reduce bias in labeling processes, which aims to mitigate the influence of human bias by leveraging the power of machines to improve the accuracy and fairness of labeling processes. This approach has the potential to improve offensive language classification tasks across multiple languages and reduce the prevalence of offensive content on social media.

> Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel module that allows for a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism. It provides a fine-grained security framework enabling system administrators to define security policies at the system and application level. Whilst SELinux offers robust security features through a customisable, powerful RBAC model, its manual policy management is prone to error, leaving the system vulnerable to accidental misconfigurations or loopholes. We present a tool to automate the conversion of SELinux policies into satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), enabling the verification of the intended security configurations using automated theorem proving. Our tool is capable of flagging common policy misconfigurations by asserting consistency between supplied RBAC policies and the intended specification by the user in SMT. RBAC policies are inherently complicated to verify entirely. We envision that the automated tool presented here can be further extended to identify an even broader range of policy misconfigurations, relieving the burden of managing convoluted policies on system administrators.

> Over recent years, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has seen increasing adoption, with now 37.8% of the major networks filtering bogus BGP routes. Systems interact with the RPKI over Relying Party (RP) implementations that fetch RPKI objects and feed BGP routers with the validated prefix-ownership data. Consequently, any vulnerabilities or flaws within the RP software can substantially threaten the stability and security of Internet routing. We uncover severe flaws in all popular RP implementations, making them susceptible to path traversal attacks, remotely triggered crashes, and inherent inconsistencies, violating RPKI standards. We report a total of 18 vulnerabilities that canbe exploited to downgrade RPKI validation in border routers or, worse, enable poisoning of the validation process, resulting in malicious prefixes being wrongfully validated and legitimate RPKI-covered prefixes failing validation. Furthermore, our research discloses inconsistencies in the validation process, with two popular implementations leaving 8149 prefixes unprotected from hijacks, 6405 of which belong to Amazon. While these findings are significant in their own right, our principal contribution lies in developing CURE, the first-of-its-kind system to systematically detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and RFC compliance issues in RP implementations via automated test generation. CURE is a powerful RPKI publication point emulator that enables easy and efficient fuzzing of complex RP validation pipelines. It is designed with a set of novel techniques, utilizing differential and stateful fuzzing. We generated over 600 million test cases and tested all popular RPs on them. Following our disclosure, the vendors already assigned CVEs to the vulnerabilities we found.

> The evaluation of abstractive summarization models typically uses test data that is identically distributed as training data. In real-world practice, documents to be summarized may contain input noise caused by text extraction artifacts or data pipeline bugs. The robustness of model performance under distribution shift caused by such noise is relatively under-studied. We present a large empirical study quantifying the sometimes severe loss in performance (up to 12 ROUGE-1 points) from different types of input noise for a range of datasets and model sizes. We then propose a light-weight method for detecting and removing such noise in the input during model inference without requiring any extra training, auxiliary models, or even prior knowledge of the type of noise. Our proposed approach effectively mitigates the loss in performance, recovering a large fraction of the performance drop, sometimes as large as 11 ROUGE-1 points.

IPFS is used as remote data storage for numerous blockchain-based smart contracts, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and decentralized applications.   We present a content censorship attack that can be executed with minimal effort and cost, and that prevents the retrieval of any chosen content in the IPFS network. The attack exploits a conceptual issue in a core component of IPFS, the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is used to resolve content IDs to peer addresses. We provide efficient detection and mitigation mechanisms for this vulnerability. Our mechanisms achieve a 99.6\% detection rate and mitigate 100\% of the detected attacks with minimal signaling and computational overhead.

> Federated learning encounters a critical challenge of data heterogeneity, adversely affecting the performance and convergence of the federated model. Various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, yet their effectiveness is still limited. Recent studies have revealed that the federated model suffers severe forgetting in local training, leading to global forgetting and performance degradation. Although the analysis provides valuable insights, a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerable classes and their impact factors is yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by systematically analyzing the forgetting degree of each class during local training across different communication rounds. Our observations are: (1) Both missing and non-dominant classes suffer similar severe forgetting during local training, while dominant classes show improvement in performance. (2) When dynamically reducing the sample size of a dominant class, catastrophic forgetting occurs abruptly when the proportion of its samples is below a certain threshold, indicating that the local model struggles to leverage a few samples of a specific class effectively to prevent forgetting. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel and straightforward algorithm called Federated Knowledge Anchor (FedKA). Assuming that all clients have a single shared sample for each class, the knowledge anchor is constructed before each local training stage by extracting shared samples for missing classes and randomly selecting one sample per class for non-dominant classes. The knowledge anchor is then utilized to correct the gradient of each mini-batch towards the direction of preserving the knowledge of the missing and non-dominant classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FedKA achieves fast and stable convergence, significantly improving accuracy on popular benchmarks.

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are vulnerable to information leakage of their training data, which can be highly sensitive, for example in medical imaging. Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), such as Differential Privacy (DP), aim to circumvent these susceptibilities. DP is the strongest possible protection for training models while bounding the risks of inferring the inclusion of training samples or reconstructing the original data. DP achieves this by setting a quantifiable privacy budget. Although a lower budget decreases the risk of information leakage, it typically also reduces the performance of such models. This imposes a trade-off between robust performance and stringent privacy. Additionally, the interpretation of a privacy budget remains abstract and challenging to contextualize. In this study, we contrast the performance of AI models at various privacy budgets against both, theoretical risk bounds and empirical success of reconstruction attacks. We show that using very large privacy budgets can render reconstruction attacks impossible, while drops in performance are negligible. We thus conclude that not using DP -- at all -- is negligent when applying AI models to sensitive data. We deem those results to lie a foundation for further debates on striking a balance between privacy risks and model performance.

> The increased connectivity and potential insider threats make traditional network defense vulnerable. Instead of assuming that everything behind the security perimeter is safe, the zero-trust security model verifies every incoming request before granting access. This chapter draws attention to the cyber resilience within the zero-trust model. We introduce the evolution from traditional perimeter-based security to zero trust and discuss their difference. Two key elements of the zero-trust engine are trust evaluation (TE) and policy engine (PE). We introduce the design of the two components and discuss how their interplay would contribute to cyber resilience. Dynamic game theory and learning are applied as quantitative approaches to achieve automated zero-trust cyber resilience. Several case studies and implementations are introduced to illustrate the benefits of such a security model.

> Floods cause large losses to property, life, and livelihoods across the world every year, hindering sustainable development. Safety nets to help absorb financial shocks in disasters, such as insurance, are often unavailable in regions of the world most vulnerable to floods, like Bangladesh. Index-based insurance has emerged as an affordable solution, which considers weather data or information from satellites to create a "flood index" that should correlate with the damage insured. However, existing flood event databases are often incomplete, and satellite sensors are not reliable under extreme weather conditions (e.g., because of clouds), which limits the spatial and temporal resolution of current approaches for index-based insurance.   In this work, we explore a novel approach for supporting satellite-based flood index insurance by extracting high-resolution spatio-temporal information from news media. First, we publish a dataset consisting of 40,000 news articles covering flood events in Bangladesh by 10 prominent news sources, and inundated area estimates for each division in Bangladesh collected from a satellite radar sensor. Second, we show that keyword-based models are not adequate for this novel application, while context-based classifiers cover complex and implicit flood related patterns. Third, we show that time series extracted from news media have substantial correlation Spearman's rho$=0.70 with satellite estimates of inundated area. Our work demonstrates that news media is a promising source for improving the temporal resolution and expanding the spatial coverage of the available flood damage data.

This paper reviews recent literature related to LLM assessment and vulnerabilities to synthesize the current research landscape and to help understand what advances are most critical to enable use of of these technologies in intelligence and safety-critical applications. The vulnerabilities are broken down into ten high-level categories and overlaid onto a high-level life cycle of an LLM. Some general categories of mitigations are reviewed.

> This work investigates the potential of undermining both fairness and detection performance in abusive language detection. In a dynamic and complex digital world, it is crucial to investigate the vulnerabilities of these detection models to adversarial fairness attacks to improve their fairness robustness. We propose a simple yet effective framework FABLE that leverages backdoor attacks as they allow targeted control over the fairness and detection performance. FABLE explores three types of trigger designs (i.e., rare, artificial, and natural triggers) and novel sampling strategies. Specifically, the adversary can inject triggers into samples in the minority group with the favored outcome (i.e., "non-abusive") and flip their labels to the unfavored outcome, i.e., "abusive". Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FABLE attacking fairness and utility in abusive language detection.

> Despite the advanced capabilities of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, they remain vulnerable to adversarial and backdoor attacks. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in real-world deployments, where compromised models may exhibit unpredictable behavior in critical scenarios. Such risks are heightened by the prevalent practice of collecting massive, internet-sourced datasets for pre-training multimodal models, as these datasets may harbor backdoors. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of backdooring in these models such as CleanCLIP which is the current state-of-the-art approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficacy of CleanCLIP in mitigating backdoors is highly dependent on the particular objective used during model pre-training. We observe that stronger pre-training objectives correlate with harder to remove backdoors behaviors. We show this by training multimodal models on two large datasets consisting of 3 million (CC3M) and 6 million (CC6M) datapoints, under various pre-training objectives, followed by poison removal using CleanCLIP. We find that CleanCLIP is ineffective when stronger pre-training objectives are used, even with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Our findings underscore critical considerations for ML practitioners who pre-train models using large-scale web-curated data and are concerned about potential backdoor threats. Notably, our results suggest that simpler pre-training objectives are more amenable to effective backdoor removal. This insight is pivotal for practitioners seeking to balance the trade-offs between using stronger pre-training objectives and security against backdoor attacks.

> In recent years, NLP practitioners have converged on the following practice: (i) import an off-the-shelf pretrained (masked) language model; (ii) append a multilayer perceptron atop the CLS token's hidden representation (with randomly initialized weights); and (iii) fine-tune the entire model on a downstream task (MLP-FT). This procedure has produced massive gains on standard NLP benchmarks, but these models remain brittle, even to mild adversarial perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate surprising gains in adversarial robustness enjoyed by Model-tuning Via Prompts (MVP), an alternative method of adapting to downstream tasks. Rather than appending an MLP head to make output prediction, MVP appends a prompt template to the input, and makes prediction via text infilling/completion. Across 5 NLP datasets, 4 adversarial attacks, and 3 different models, MVP improves performance against adversarial substitutions by an average of 8% over standard methods and even outperforms adversarial training-based state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By combining MVP with adversarial training, we achieve further improvements in adversarial robustness while maintaining performance on unperturbed examples. Finally, we conduct ablations to investigate the mechanism underlying these gains. Notably, we find that the main causes of vulnerability of MLP-FT can be attributed to the misalignment between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, and the randomly initialized MLP parameters.

> Detecting non-termination is crucial for ensuring program correctness and security, such as preventing denial-of-service attacks. While termination analysis has been studied for many years, existing methods have limited scalability and are only effective on small programs. To address this issue, we propose a practical termination checking technique, called EndWatch, for detecting non-termination caused by infinite loops through testing. Specifically, we introduce two methods to generate non-termination oracles based on checking state revisits, i.e., if the program returns to a previously visited state at the same program location, it does not terminate. The non-termination oracles can be incorporated into testing tools (e.g., AFL used in this paper) to detect non-termination in large programs. For linear loops, we perform symbolic execution on individual loops to infer State Revisit Conditions (SRCs) and instrument SRCs into target loops. For non-linear loops, we instrument target loops for checking concrete state revisits during execution. We evaluated EndWatch on standard benchmarks with small-sized programs and real-world projects with large-sized programs. The evaluation results show that EndWatch is more effective than the state-of-the-art tools on standard benchmarks (detecting 87% of non-terminating programs while the best baseline detects only 67%), and useful in detecting non-termination in real-world projects (detecting 90% of known non-termination CVEs and 4 unknown bugs).

> Self-supervised learning (SSL), a paradigm harnessing unlabeled datasets to train robust encoders, has recently witnessed substantial success. These encoders serve as pivotal feature extractors for downstream tasks, demanding significant computational resources. Nevertheless, recent studies have shed light on vulnerabilities in pre-trained encoders, including backdoor and adversarial threats. Safeguarding the intellectual property of encoder trainers and ensuring the trustworthiness of deployed encoders pose notable challenges in SSL. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SSL-Auth, the first authentication framework designed explicitly for pre-trained encoders. SSL-Auth leverages selected key samples and employs a well-trained generative network to reconstruct watermark information, thus affirming the integrity of the encoder without compromising its performance. By comparing the reconstruction outcomes of the key samples, we can identify any malicious alterations. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on a range of encoders and diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SSL-Auth.

> The most meaningful connections between people are often fostered through expression of shared vulnerability and emotional experiences in personal narratives. We introduce a new task of identifying similarity in personal stories based on empathic resonance, i.e., the extent to which two people empathize with each others' experiences, as opposed to raw semantic or lexical similarity, as has predominantly been studied in NLP. Using insights from social psychology, we craft a framework that operationalizes empathic similarity in terms of three key features of stories: main events, emotional trajectories, and overall morals or takeaways. We create EmpathicStories, a dataset of 1,500 personal stories annotated with our empathic similarity features, and 2,000 pairs of stories annotated with empathic similarity scores. Using our dataset, we fine-tune a model to compute empathic similarity of story pairs, and show that this outperforms semantic similarity models on automated correlation and retrieval metrics. Through a user study with 150 participants, we also assess the effect our model has on retrieving stories that users empathize with, compared to naive semantic similarity-based retrieval, and find that participants empathized significantly more with stories retrieved by our model. Our work has strong implications for the use of empathy-aware models to foster human connection and empathy between people.

This work is based on enhancing the robustness of targeted classifier models against adversarial attacks. To achieve this, an convolutional autoencoder-based approach is employed that effectively counters adversarial perturbations introduced to the input images. By generating images closely resembling the input images, the proposed methodology aims to restore the model's accuracy.

> This paper addresses the question whether model knowledge can guide a defender to appropriate decisions, or not, when an attacker intrudes into control systems. The model-based defense scheme considered in this study, namely Bayesian defense mechanism, chooses reasonable reactions through observation of the system's behavior using models of the system's stochastic dynamics, the vulnerability to be exploited, and the attacker's objective. On the other hand, rational attackers take deceptive strategies for misleading the defender into making inappropriate decisions. In this paper, their dynamic decision making is formulated as a stochastic signaling game. It is shown that the belief of the true scenario has a limit in a stochastic sense at an equilibrium based on martingale analysis. This fact implies that there are only two possible cases: the defender asymptotically detects the attack with a firm belief, or the attacker takes actions such that the system's behavior becomes nominal after a finite time step. Consequently, if different scenarios result in different stochastic behaviors, the Bayesian defense mechanism guarantees the system to be secure in an asymptotic manner provided that effective countermeasures are implemented. As an application of the finding, a defensive deception utilizing asymmetric recognition of vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker is analyzed. It is shown that the attacker possibly stops the attack even if the defender is unaware of the exploited vulnerabilities as long as the defender's unawareness is concealed by the defensive deception.

- `2312.03979v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03979v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03979v1)

> Deep Graph Learning (DGL) has emerged as a crucial technique across various domains. However, recent studies have exposed vulnerabilities in DGL models, such as susceptibility to evasion and poisoning attacks. While empirical and provable robustness techniques have been developed to defend against graph modification attacks (GMAs), the problem of certified robustness against graph injection attacks (GIAs) remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the node-aware bi-smoothing framework, which is the first certifiably robust approach for general node classification tasks against GIAs. Notably, the proposed node-aware bi-smoothing scheme is model-agnostic and is applicable for both evasion and poisoning attacks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish the certifiable conditions of our smoothing scheme. We also explore the practical implications of our node-aware bi-smoothing schemes in two contexts: as an empirical defense approach against real-world GIAs and in the context of recommendation systems. Furthermore, we extend two state-of-the-art certified robustness frameworks to address node injection attacks and compare our approach against them. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed certificates.

- `2312.04035v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04035v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04035v1)

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) hardware accelerators have been widely adopted to enhance the efficiency of deep learning applications. However, they also raise security concerns regarding their vulnerability to power side-channel attacks (SCA). In these attacks, the adversary exploits unintended communication channels to infer sensitive information processed by the accelerator, posing significant privacy and copyright risks to the models. Advanced machine learning algorithms are further employed to facilitate the side-channel analysis and exacerbate the privacy issue of AI accelerators. Traditional defense strategies naively inject execution noise to the runtime of AI models, which inevitably introduce large overheads.   In this paper, we present AIAShield, a novel defense methodology to safeguard FPGA-based AI accelerators and mitigate model extraction threats via power-based SCAs. The key insight of AIAShield is to leverage the prominent adversarial attack technique from the machine learning community to craft delicate noise, which can significantly obfuscate the adversary's side-channel observation while incurring minimal overhead to the execution of the protected model. At the hardware level, we design a new module based on ring oscillators to achieve fine-grained noise generation. At the algorithm level, we repurpose Neural Architecture Search to worsen the adversary's extraction results. Extensive experiments on the Nvidia Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) demonstrate that AIAShield outperforms existing solutions with excellent transferability.

> We propose PRISM to enable users of machine translation systems to preserve the privacy of data on their own initiative. There is a growing demand to apply machine translation systems to data that require privacy protection. While several machine translation engines claim to prioritize privacy, the extent and specifics of such protection are largely ambiguous. First, there is often a lack of clarity on how and to what degree the data is protected. Even if service providers believe they have sufficient safeguards in place, sophisticated adversaries might still extract sensitive information. Second, vulnerabilities may exist outside of these protective measures, such as within communication channels, potentially leading to data leakage. As a result, users are hesitant to utilize machine translation engines for data demanding high levels of privacy protection, thereby missing out on their benefits. PRISM resolves this problem. Instead of relying on the translation service to keep data safe, PRISM provides the means to protect data on the user's side. This approach ensures that even machine translation engines with inadequate privacy measures can be used securely. For platforms already equipped with privacy safeguards, PRISM acts as an additional protection layer, reinforcing their security furthermore. PRISM adds these privacy features without significantly compromising translation accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PRISM using real-world translators, T5 and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo), and the datasets with two languages. PRISM effectively balances privacy protection with translation accuracy.

> The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) has enabled small, ubiquitous medical devices to communicate with each other to facilitate interconnected healthcare delivery. These devices interact using communication protocols like MQTT, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. However, as MIoT devices proliferate, these networked devices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper focuses on the vulnerabilities present in the Message Queuing Telemetry and Transport (MQTT) protocol. The MQTT protocol is prone to cyber-attacks that can harm the system's functionality. The memory-constrained MIoT devices enforce a limitation on storing all data logs that are required for comprehensive network forensics. This paper solves the data log availability challenge by detecting the attack in real-time and storing the corresponding logs for further analysis with the proposed network forensics framework: MediHunt. Machine learning (ML) techniques are the most real safeguard against cyber-attacks. However, these models require a specific dataset that covers diverse attacks on the MQTT-based IoT system for training. The currently available datasets do not encompass a variety of applications and TCP layer attacks. To address this issue, we leveraged the usage of a flow-based dataset containing flow data for TCP/IP layer and application layer attacks. Six different ML models are trained with the generated dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the MediHunt framework in detecting real-time attacks. F1 scores and detection accuracy exceeded 0.99 for the proposed MediHunt framework with our custom dataset.

> Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure, responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. However, DNS is vulnerable to some malicious attacks, including DNS cache poisoning, which redirects users to malicious websites displaying offensive or illegal content. Existing countermeasures often suffer from at least one of the following weakness: weak attack resistance, high overhead, or complex implementation. To address these challenges, this paper presents TI-DNS, a blockchain-based DNS resolution architecture designed to detect and correct the forged DNS records caused by the cache poisoning attacks in the DNS resolution process. TI-DNS leverages a multi-resolver Query Vote mechanism to ensure the credibility of verified records on the blockchain ledger and a stake-based incentive mechanism to promote well-behaved participation. Importantly, TI-DNS is easy to be adopted as it only requires modifications to the resolver side of current DNS infrastructure. Finally, we develop a prototype and evaluate it against alternative solutions. The result demonstrates that TI-DNS effectively and efficiently solves DNS cache poisoning.

This paper presents GSGFormer, an innovative generative model adept at predicting pedestrian trajectories by considering these complex interactions and offering a plethora of potential modal behaviors. We incorporate a heterogeneous graph neural network to capture interactions between pedestrians, semantic maps, and potential destinations. The Transformer module extracts temporal features, while our novel CVAE-Residual-GMM module promotes diverse behavioral modality generation. Through evaluations on multiple public datasets, GSGFormer not only outperforms leading methods with ample data but also remains competitive when data is limited.

> Substantial scholarship has estimated the susceptibility of jobs to automation, but little has examined how job contents evolve in the information age as new technologies substitute for tasks, shifting required skills rather than eliminating entire jobs. Here we explore patterns and consequences of changes in occupational skill and characterize occupations and workers subject to the greatest re-skilling pressure. Recent work found that changing skill requirements are greatest for STEM occupations. Nevertheless, analyzing 167 million online job posts covering 727 occupations over the last decade, we find that re-skilling pressure is greatest for low-skilled occupations when accounting for distance between skills. We further investigate the differences in skill change across employer and market size, as well as social demographic groups, and find that these differences tend to widen the economic divide. Jobs from large employers and markets experienced less change relative to small employers and markets, and non-white workers in low-skilled jobs are most demographically vulnerable. We conclude by showcasing our model's potential to precisely chart job evolution towards machine-interface integration using skill embedding spaces.

> Growing applications of large language models (LLMs) trained by a third party raise serious concerns on the security vulnerability of LLMs.It has been demonstrated that malicious actors can covertly exploit these vulnerabilities in LLMs through poisoning attacks aimed at generating undesirable outputs. While poisoning attacks have received significant attention in the image domain (e.g., object detection), and classification tasks, their implications for generative models, particularly in the realm of natural language generation (NLG) tasks, remain poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we perform a comprehensive exploration of various poisoning techniques to assess their effectiveness across a range of generative tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a range of metrics designed to quantify the success and stealthiness of poisoning attacks specifically tailored to NLG tasks. Through extensive experiments on multiple NLG tasks, LLMs and datasets, we show that it is possible to successfully poison an LLM during the fine-tuning stage using as little as 1\% of the total tuning data samples. Our paper presents the first systematic approach to comprehend poisoning attacks targeting NLG tasks considering a wide range of triggers and attack settings. We hope our findings will assist the AI security community in devising appropriate defenses against such threats.

> Fuzzing is a highly-scalable software testing technique that uncovers bugs in a target program by executing it with mutated inputs. Over the life of a fuzzing campaign, the fuzzer accumulates inputs inducing new and interesting target behaviors, drawing from these inputs for further mutation. This rapidly results in a large number of inputs to select from, making it challenging to quickly and accurately select the "most promising" input for mutation. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a natural solution to this "seed scheduling" problem: the fuzzer dynamically adapts its selection strategy by learning from past results. However, existing RL approaches are (a) computationally expensive (reducing fuzzer throughput) and/or (b) require hyperparameter tuning (reducing generality across targets and input types). To this end, we propose T-Scheduler, a seed scheduler built on multi-armed bandit theory that automatically adapts to the target without any hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate T-Scheduler over 35 CPU-yr of fuzzing, comparing it to 11 state-of-the-art schedulers. Our results show that T-Scheduler improves on these 11 schedulers on both bug-finding and coverage-expansion abilities.

> While the pandemic highlighted the critical role technology plays in children's lives, not all Australian children have reliable access to technology. This situation exacerbates educational disadvantage for children who are already amongst our nation's most vulnerable. In this research project, we carried out a pilot project with three schools in Western Australia, conducting a series of workshops and interviews with students, parents, school staff members, and teachers. Drawing on rich empirical material, we identify key barriers and enablers for digitally inclusive online learning at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, and infrastructural levels. Of particular importance is that technology is only part of this story - an array of social, environmental, and skills "infrastructure" is needed to facilitate inclusive online learning. Building on this finding, we ran a Digital Inclusion Studio to address this holistic set of issues with strongly positive feedback from participants. We conclude with a set of recommendations for stakeholders (parents, schools, government agencies) who wish to support more digitally inclusive learning.

> Federated Learning (FL) offers collaborative model training without data sharing but is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where poisoned model weights lead to compromised system integrity. Existing countermeasures, primarily based on anomaly detection, are prone to erroneous rejections of normal weights while accepting poisoned ones, largely due to shortcomings in quantifying similarities among client models. Furthermore, other defenses demonstrate effectiveness only when dealing with a limited number of malicious clients, typically fewer than 10%. To alleviate these vulnerabilities, we present G$^2$uardFL, a protective framework that reinterprets the identification of malicious clients as an attributed graph clustering problem, thus safeguarding FL systems. Specifically, this framework employs a client graph clustering approach to identify malicious clients and integrates an adaptive mechanism to amplify the discrepancy between the aggregated model and the poisoned ones, effectively eliminating embedded backdoors. We also conduct a theoretical analysis of convergence to confirm that G$^2$uardFL does not affect the convergence of FL systems. Through empirical evaluation, comparing G$^2$uardFL with cutting-edge defenses, such as FLAME (USENIX Security 2022) [28] and DeepSight (NDSS 2022) [36], against various backdoor attacks including 3DFed (SP 2023) [20], our results demonstrate its significant effectiveness in mitigating backdoor attacks while having a negligible impact on the aggregated model's performance on benign samples (i.e., the primary task performance). For instance, in an FL system with 25% malicious clients, G$^2$uardFL reduces the attack success rate to 10.61%, while maintaining a primary task performance of 73.05% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This surpasses the performance of the best-performing baseline, which merely achieves a primary task performance of 19.54%.

> Large language models (LLMs) have undergone rapid evolution and achieved remarkable results in recent times. OpenAI's ChatGPT, backed by GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, has gained instant popularity due to its strong capability across a wide range of tasks, including natural language tasks, coding, mathematics, and engaging conversations. However, the impacts and limits of such LLMs in system security domain are less explored. In this paper, we delve into the limits of LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in seven software security applications including vulnerability detection/repair, debugging, debloating, decompilation, patching, root cause analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing. Our exploration reveals that ChatGPT not only excels at generating code, which is the conventional application of language models, but also demonstrates strong capability in understanding user-provided commands in natural languages, reasoning about control and data flows within programs, generating complex data structures, and even decompiling assembly code. Notably, GPT-4 showcases significant improvements over GPT-3.5 in most security tasks. Also, certain limitations of ChatGPT in security-related tasks are identified, such as its constrained ability to process long code contexts.

> In an increasingly interconnected and data-driven world, the importance of robust security measures cannot be overstated. A knowledge graph constructed with information extracted from the system along with the desired security behavior can be utilized to identify complex security vulnerabilities hidden underneath the systems. Unfortunately, existing security knowledge graphs are constructed from coarse-grained information extracted from publicly available vulnerability reports, which are not equipped to check actual security violations in real-world system implementations. In this poster, we present a novel approach of using Program Knowledge Graph that is embedded with fine-grained execution information of the systems (e.g., callgraph, data-flow, etc.) along with information extracted from the public vulnerability and weakness datasets (e.g., CVE and CWE). We further demonstrate that our custom security knowledge graph can be checked against the standard queries generated by LLM, providing a powerful way to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in critical systems.

> Nowadays, neuromorphic systems based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) attract attentions of many researchers. There are many studies to improve performances of neuromorphic systems. These studies have been showing satisfactory results. To magnify performances of neuromorphic systems, developing actual neuromorphic systems is essential. For developing them, memristors play key role due to their useful characteristics. Although memristors are essential for actual neuromorphic systems, they are vulnerable to faults. However, there are few studies analyzing effects of fault elements in neuromorphic systems using memristors. To solve this problem, we analyze performance of a memristive neuromorphic system with fault elements changing fault ratios, types, and positions. We choose neurons and synapses to inject faults. We inject two types of faults to synapses: SA0 and SA1 faults. The fault synapses appear in random and important positions. Through our analysis, we discover the following four interesting points. First, memristive characteristics increase vulnerability of neuromorphic systems to fault elements. Second, fault neuron ratios reducing performance sharply exist. Third, performance degradation by fault synapses depends on fault types. Finally, SA1 fault synapses improve performance when they appear in important positions.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, raising security concerns about their deployment in mission-critical applications. While existing defense methods have demonstrated promising results, it is still not clear how to effectively remove backdoor-associated neurons in backdoored DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel defense called \emph{Reconstructive Neuron Pruning} (RNP) to expose and prune backdoor neurons via an unlearning and then recovering process. Specifically, RNP first unlearns the neurons by maximizing the model's error on a small subset of clean samples and then recovers the neurons by minimizing the model's error on the same data. In RNP, unlearning is operated at the neuron level while recovering is operated at the filter level, forming an asymmetric reconstructive learning procedure. We show that such an asymmetric process on only a few clean samples can effectively expose and prune the backdoor neurons implanted by a wide range of attacks, achieving a new state-of-the-art defense performance. Moreover, the unlearned model at the intermediate step of our RNP can be directly used to improve other backdoor defense tasks including backdoor removal, trigger recovery, backdoor label detection, and backdoor sample detection.

> Digital Imaging and Communication System (DICOM) is widely used throughout the public health sector for portability in medical imaging. However, these DICOM files have vulnerabilities present in the preamble section. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow attackers to embed executable codes in the 128-Byte preamble of DICOM files. Embedding the malicious executable will not interfere with the readability or functionality of DICOM imagery. However, it will affect the underline system silently upon viewing these files. This paper shows the infiltration of Windows malware executables into DICOM files. On viewing the files, the malicious DICOM will get executed and eventually infect the entire hospital network through the radiologist's workstation. The code injection process of executing malware in DICOM files affects the hospital networks and workstations' memory. Memory forensics for the infected radiologist's workstation is crucial as it can detect which malware disrupts the hospital environment, and future detection methods can be deployed. In this paper, we consider the machine learning (ML) algorithms to conduct memory forensics on three memory dump categories: Trojan, Spyware, and Ransomware, taken from the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset. We obtain the highest accuracy of 75% with the Random Forest model. For estimating the feature importance for ML model prediction, we leveraged the concept of Shapley values.

> Current Visual-Language Pre-training (VLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. These adversarial examples present substantial security risks to VLP models, as they can leverage inherent weaknesses in the models, resulting in incorrect predictions. In contrast to white-box adversarial attacks, transfer attacks (where the adversary crafts adversarial examples on a white-box model to fool another black-box model) are more reflective of real-world scenarios, thus making them more meaningful for research. By summarizing and analyzing existing research, we identified two factors that can influence the efficacy of transfer attacks on VLP models: inter-modal interaction and data diversity. Based on these insights, we propose a self-augment-based transfer attack method, termed SA-Attack. Specifically, during the generation of adversarial images and adversarial texts, we apply different data augmentation methods to the image modality and text modality, respectively, with the aim of improving the adversarial transferability of the generated adversarial images and texts. Experiments conducted on the FLickr30K and COCO datasets have validated the effectiveness of our method. Our code will be available after this paper is accepted.

> DBMS bugs can cause serious consequences, posing severe security and privacy concerns. This paper works towards the detection of memory bugs and logic bugs in DBMSs, and aims to solve the two innate challenges, including how to generate semantically correct SQL queries in a test case, and how to propose effective oracles to capture logic bugs. To this end, our system proposes two key techniques. The first key technique is called context-sensitive instantiation, which considers all static semantic requirements (including but not limited to the identifier type used by existing systems) to generate semantically valid SQL queries. The second key technique is called multi-plan execution, which can effectively capture logic bugs. Given a test case, multi-plan execution makes the DBMS execute all query plans instead of the default optimal one, and compares the results. A logic bug is detected if a difference is found among the execution results of the executed query plans. We have implemented a prototype system called Kangaroo and applied it to three widely used and well-tested DBMSs, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Our system successfully detected 50 new bugs. The comparison between our system with the state-of-the-art systems shows that our system outperforms them in terms of the number of generated semantically valid SQL queries, the explored code paths during testing, and the detected bugs.

> What happens to an autonomous vehicle (AV) if its data are adversarially compromised? Prior security studies have addressed this question through mostly unrealistic threat models, with limited practical relevance, such as white-box adversarial learning or nanometer-scale laser aiming and spoofing. With growing evidence that cyber threats pose real, imminent danger to AVs and cyber-physical systems (CPS) in general, we present and evaluate a novel AV threat model: a cyber-level attacker capable of disrupting sensor data but lacking any situational awareness. We demonstrate that even though the attacker has minimal knowledge and only access to raw data from a single sensor (i.e., LiDAR), she can design several attacks that critically compromise perception and tracking in multi-sensor AVs. To mitigate vulnerabilities and advance secure architectures in AVs, we introduce two improvements for security-aware fusion: a probabilistic data-asymmetry monitor and a scalable track-to-track fusion of 3D LiDAR and monocular detections (T2T-3DLM); we demonstrate that the approaches significantly reduce attack effectiveness. To support objective safety and security evaluations in AVs, we release our security evaluation platform, AVsec, which is built on security-relevant metrics to benchmark AVs on gold-standard longitudinal AV datasets and AV simulators.

> Deep learning source code models have been applied very successfully to the problem of automated program repair. One of the standing issues is the small input window of current models which often cannot fully fit the context code required for a bug fix (e.g., method or class declarations of a project). Instead, input is often restricted to the local context, that is, the lines below and above the bug location. In this work we study the importance of this local context on repair success: how much local context is needed?; is context before or after the bug location more important? how is local context tied to the bug type? To answer these questions we train and evaluate Transformer models in many different local context configurations on three datasets and two programming languages. Our results indicate that overall repair success increases with the size of the local context (albeit not for all bug types) and confirm the common practice that roughly 50-60% of the input window should be used for context leading the bug. Our results are not only relevant for researchers working on Transformer-based APR tools but also for benchmark and dataset creators who must decide what and how much context to include in their datasets.

- `2312.11500v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11500v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11500v1)

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is being ubiquitously adopted to automate processes in science and industry. However, due to its often intricate and opaque nature, AI has been shown to possess inherent vulnerabilities which can be maliciously exploited with adversarial AI, potentially putting AI users and developers at both cyber and physical risk. In addition, there is insufficient comprehension of the real-world effects of adversarial AI and an inadequacy of AI security examinations; therefore, the growing threat landscape is unknown for many AI solutions. To mitigate this issue, we propose one of the first red team frameworks for evaluating the AI security of maritime autonomous systems. The framework provides operators with a proactive (secure by design) and reactive (post-deployment evaluation) response to securing AI technology today and in the future. This framework is a multi-part checklist, which can be tailored to different systems and requirements. We demonstrate this framework to be highly effective for a red team to use to uncover numerous vulnerabilities within a real-world maritime autonomous systems AI, ranging from poisoning to adversarial patch attacks. The lessons learned from systematic AI red teaming can help prevent MAS-related catastrophic events in a world with increasing uptake and reliance on mission-critical AI.

> Recently, diffusion models have become popular tools for image synthesis because of their high-quality outputs. However, like other large-scale models, they may leak private information about their training data. Here, we demonstrate a privacy vulnerability of diffusion models through a \emph{membership inference (MI) attack}, which aims to identify whether a target example belongs to the training set when given the trained diffusion model. Our proposed MI attack learns quantile regression models that predict (a quantile of) the distribution of reconstruction loss on examples not used in training. This allows us to define a granular hypothesis test for determining the membership of a point in the training set, based on thresholding the reconstruction loss of that point using a custom threshold tailored to the example. We also provide a simple bootstrap technique that takes a majority membership prediction over ``a bag of weak attackers'' which improves the accuracy over individual quantile regression models. We show that our attack outperforms the prior state-of-the-art attack while being substantially less computationally expensive -- prior attacks required training multiple ``shadow models'' with the same architecture as the model under attack, whereas our attack requires training only much smaller models.

> Model extraction (ME) attacks represent one major threat to Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms by ``stealing'' the functionality of confidential machine-learning models through querying black-box APIs. Over seven years have passed since ME attacks were first conceptualized in the seminal work. During this period, substantial advances have been made in both ME attacks and MLaaS platforms, raising the intriguing question: How has the vulnerability of MLaaS platforms to ME attacks been evolving? In this work, we conduct an in-depth study to answer this critical question. Specifically, we characterize the vulnerability of current, mainstream MLaaS platforms to ME attacks from multiple perspectives including attack strategies, learning techniques, surrogate-model design, and benchmark tasks. Many of our findings challenge previously reported results, suggesting emerging patterns of ME vulnerability. Further, by analyzing the vulnerability of the same MLaaS platforms using historical datasets from the past four years, we retrospectively characterize the evolution of ME vulnerability over time, leading to a set of interesting findings. Finally, we make suggestions about improving the current practice of MLaaS in terms of attack robustness. Our study sheds light on the current state of ME vulnerability in the wild and points to several promising directions for future research.

> Reproducibility of results is a cornerstone of the scientific method. Scientific computing encounters two challenges when aiming for this goal. Firstly, reproducibility should not depend on details of the runtime environment, such as the compiler version or computing environment, so results are verifiable by third-parties. Secondly, different versions of software code executed in the same runtime environment should produce consistent numerical results for physical quantities. In this manuscript, we test the feasibility of reproducing scientific results obtained using the IllinoisGRMHD code that is part of an open-source community software for simulation in relativistic astrophysics, the Einstein Toolkit. We verify that numerical results of simulating a single isolated neutron star with IllinoisGRMHD can be reproduced, and compare them to results reported by the code authors in 2015. We use two different supercomputers: Expanse at SDSC, and Stampede2 at TACC.   By compiling the source code archived along with the paper on both Expanse and Stampede2, we find that IllinoisGRMHD reproduces results published in its announcement paper up to errors comparable to round-off level changes in initial data parameters. We also verify that a current version of IlliinoisGRMHD reproduces these results once we account for bug fixes which has occurred since the original publication

> It is well-known that deep learning models are vulnerable to small input perturbations. Such perturbed instances are called adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are commonly crafted to fool a model either at training time (poisoning) or test time (evasion). In this work, we study the symbiosis of poisoning and evasion. We show that combining both threat models can substantially improve the devastating efficacy of adversarial attacks. Specifically, we study the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) under structure perturbations and devise a memory-efficient adaptive end-to-end attack for the novel threat model using first-order optimization.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications including video action recognition, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks (Trojans). The backdoor-compromised model will mis-classify to the target class chosen by the attacker when a test instance (from a non-target class) is embedded with a specific trigger, while maintaining high accuracy on attack-free instances. Although there are extensive studies on backdoor attacks against image data, the susceptibility of video-based systems under backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. Current studies are direct extensions of approaches proposed for image data, e.g., the triggers are independently embedded within the frames, which tend to be detectable by existing defenses. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective backdoor attack against video data. Our proposed attack, adding perturbations in a transformed domain, plants an imperceptible, temporally distributed trigger across the video frames, and is shown to be resilient to existing defensive strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various well-known models on two video recognition benchmarks, UCF101 and HMDB51, and a sign language recognition benchmark, Greek Sign Language (GSL) dataset. We delve into the impact of several influential factors on our proposed attack and identify an intriguing effect termed "collateral damage" through extensive studies.

> As blockchain smart contracts become more widespread and carry more valuable digital assets, they become an increasingly attractive target for attackers. Over the past few years, smart contracts have been subject to a plethora of devastating attacks, resulting in billions of dollars in financial losses. There has been a notable surge of research interest in identifying defects in smart contracts. However, existing smart contract fuzzing tools are still unsatisfactory. They struggle to screen out meaningful transaction sequences and specify critical inputs for each transaction. As a result, they can only trigger a limited range of contract states, making it difficult to unveil complicated vulnerabilities hidden in the deep state space.   In this paper, we shed light on smart contract fuzzing by employing a sequence-aware mutation and seed mask guidance strategy. In particular, we first utilize data-flow-based feedback to determine transaction orders in a meaningful way and further introduce a sequence-aware mutation technique to explore deeper states. Thereafter, we design a mask-guided seed mutation strategy that biases the generated transaction inputs to hit target branches. In addition, we develop a dynamic-adaptive energy adjustment paradigm that balances the fuzzing resource allocation during a fuzzing campaign. We implement our designs into a new smart contract fuzzer named MuFuzz, and extensively evaluate it on three benchmarks. Empirical results demonstrate that MuFuzz outperforms existing tools in terms of both branch coverage and bug finding. Overall, MuFuzz achieves higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers (up to 25%) and detects 30% more bugs than existing bug detectors.

> Large language models (LLMs) are becoming an integrated part of software development. These models are trained on large datasets for code, where it is hard to verify each data point. Therefore, a potential attack surface can be to inject poisonous data into the training data to make models vulnerable, aka trojaned. It can pose a significant threat by hiding manipulative behaviors inside models, leading to compromising the integrity of the models in downstream tasks.   In this paper, we propose an occlusion-based human-in-the-loop technique, OSeql, to distinguish trojan-triggering inputs of code. The technique is based on the observation that trojaned neural models of code rely heavily on the triggering part of input; hence, its removal would change the confidence of the models in their prediction substantially. Our results suggest that OSeql can detect the triggering inputs with almost 100% recall. We discuss the problem of false positives and how to address them. These results provide a baseline for future studies in this field.

> Issue resolution and bug-fixing processes are essential in the development of machine-learning libraries, similar to software development, to ensure well-optimized functions. Understanding the issue resolution and bug-fixing process of machine-learning libraries can help developers identify areas for improvement and optimize their strategies for issue resolution and bug-fixing. However, detailed studies on this topic are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of issue resolution for bug-fixing processes in six machine-learning libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, Theano, Pytorch, Caffe, and Scikit-learn. We addressed seven research questions (RQs) using 16,921 issues extracted from the GitHub repository via the GitHub Rest API. We employed several quantitative methods of data analysis, including correlation, OLS regression, percentage and frequency count, and heatmap to analyze the RQs. We found the following through our empirical investigation: (1) The most common categories of issues that arise in machine-learning libraries are bugs, documentation, optimization, crashes, enhancement, new feature requests, build/CI, support, and performance. (2) Effective strategies for addressing these problems include fixing critical bugs, optimizing performance, and improving documentation. (3) These categorized issues are related to testing and runtime and are common among all six machine-learning libraries. (4) Monitoring the total number of comments on issues can provide insights into the duration of the issues. (5) It is crucial to strike a balance between prioritizing critical issues and addressing other issues in a timely manner. Therefore, this study concludes that efficient issue-tracking processes, effective communication, and collaboration are vital for effective resolution of issues and bug fixing processes in machine-learning libraries.

> In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely used in code vulnerability detection. The DL-based methods typically extract structural information from source code, e.g., code structure graph, and adopt neural networks such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn the graph representations. However, these methods fail to consider the heterogeneous relations in the code structure graph, i.e., the heterogeneous relations mean that the different types of edges connect different types of nodes in the graph, which may obstruct the graph representation learning. Besides, these methods are limited in capturing long-range dependencies due to the deep levels in the code structure graph. In this paper, we propose a Meta-path based Attentional Graph learning model for code vulNErability deTection, called MAGNET. MAGNET constructs a multi-granularity meta-path graph for each code snippet, in which the heterogeneous relations are denoted as meta-paths to represent the structural information. A meta-path based hierarchical attentional graph neural network is also proposed to capture the relations between distant nodes in the graph. We evaluate MAGNET on three public datasets and the results show that MAGNET outperforms the best baseline method in terms of F1 score by 6.32%, 21.50%, and 25.40%, respectively. MAGNET also achieves the best performance among all the baseline methods in detecting Top-25 most dangerous Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), further demonstrating its effectiveness in vulnerability detection.

> We study the understanding of deep neural networks from the scope in which they are trained on. While the accuracy of these models is usually impressive on the aggregate level, they still make mistakes, sometimes on cases that appear to be trivial. Moreover, these models are not reliable in realizing what they do not know leading to failures such as adversarial vulnerability and out-of-distribution failures. Here, we propose a measure for quantifying the ambiguity of inputs for any given model with regard to the scope of its training. We define the ambiguity based on the geometric arrangements of the decision boundaries and the convex hull of training set in the feature space learned by the trained model, and demonstrate that a single ambiguity measure may detect a considerable portion of mistakes of a model on in-distribution samples, adversarial inputs, as well as out-of-distribution inputs. Using our ambiguity measure, a model may abstain from classification when it encounters ambiguous inputs leading to a better model accuracy not just on a given testing set, but on the inputs it may encounter at the world at large. In pursuit of this measure, we develop a theoretical framework that can identify the unknowns of the model in relation to its scope. We put this in perspective with the confidence of the model and develop formulations to identify the regions of the domain which are unknown to the model, yet the model is guaranteed to have high confidence.

> This paper studies robust nonparametric regression, in which an adversarial attacker can modify the values of up to $q$ samples from a training dataset of size $N$. Our initial solution is an M-estimator based on Huber loss minimization. Compared with simple kernel regression, i.e. the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, this method can significantly weaken the impact of malicious samples on the regression performance. We provide the convergence rate as well as the corresponding minimax lower bound. The result shows that, with proper bandwidth selection, $\ell_\infty$ error is minimax optimal. The $\ell_2$ error is optimal with relatively small $q$, but is suboptimal with larger $q$. The reason is that this estimator is vulnerable if there are many attacked samples concentrating in a small region. To address this issue, we propose a correction method by projecting the initial estimate to the space of Lipschitz functions. The final estimate is nearly minimax optimal for arbitrary $q$, up to a $\ln N$ factor.

> AI-powered coding assistant tools have revolutionized the software engineering ecosystem. However, prior work has demonstrated that these tools are vulnerable to poisoning attacks. In a poisoning attack, an attacker intentionally injects maliciously crafted insecure code snippets into training datasets to manipulate these tools. The poisoned tools can suggest insecure code to developers, resulting in vulnerabilities in their products that attackers can exploit. However, it is still little understood whether such poisoning attacks against the tools would be practical in real-world settings and how developers address the poisoning attacks during software development. To understand the real-world impact of poisoning attacks on developers who rely on AI-powered coding assistants, we conducted two user studies: an online survey and an in-lab study. The online survey involved 238 participants, including software developers and computer science students. The survey results revealed widespread adoption of these tools among participants, primarily to enhance coding speed, eliminate repetition, and gain boilerplate code. However, the survey also found that developers may misplace trust in these tools because they overlooked the risk of poisoning attacks. The in-lab study was conducted with 30 professional developers. The developers were asked to complete three programming tasks with a representative type of AI-powered coding assistant tool, running on Visual Studio Code. The in-lab study results showed that developers using a poisoned ChatGPT-like tool were more prone to including insecure code than those using an IntelliCode-like tool or no tool. This demonstrates the strong influence of these tools on the security of generated code. Our study results highlight the need for education and improved coding practices to address new security issues introduced by AI-powered coding assistant tools.

> High-level synthesis (HLS) tools have provided significant productivity enhancements to the design flow of digital systems in recent years, resulting in highly-optimized circuits, in terms of area and latency. Given the evolution of hardware attacks, which can render them vulnerable, it is essential to consider security as a significant aspect of the HLS design flow. Yet the need to evaluate a huge number of functionally equivalent de-signs of the HLS design space challenges hardware security evaluation methods (e.g., fault injection - FI campaigns). In this work, we propose an evaluation methodology of hardware security properties of HLS-produced designs using state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches that achieves significant speedup and better scalability than typical evaluation methods (such as FI). We demonstrate the proposed methodology on a Double Modular Redundancy (DMR) coun-termeasure applied on an AES SBox implementation, en-hanced by diversifying the redundant modules through HLS directives. The experimental results show that GNNs can be efficiently trained to predict important hardware security met-rics concerning fault attacks (e.g., critical and detection error rates), by using regression. The proposed method predicts the fault vulnerability metrics of the HLS-based designs with high R-squared scores and achieves huge speedup compared to fault injection once the training of the GNN is completed.

> Machine learning (ML) has gained significant adoption in Android malware detection to address the escalating threats posed by the rapid proliferation of malware attacks. However, recent studies have revealed the inherent vulnerabilities of ML-based detection systems to evasion attacks. While efforts have been made to address this critical issue, many of the existing defensive methods encounter challenges such as lower effectiveness or reduced generalization capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel Android malware detection method, MalPurifier, which exploits adversarial purification to eliminate perturbations independently, resulting in attack mitigation in a light and flexible way. Specifically, MalPurifier employs a Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE)-based purification model to preprocess input samples, removing potential perturbations from them and then leading to correct classification. To enhance defense effectiveness, we propose a diversified adversarial perturbation mechanism that strengthens the purification model against different manipulations from various evasion attacks. We also incorporate randomized "protective noises" onto benign samples to prevent excessive purification. Furthermore, we customize a loss function for improving the DAE model, combining reconstruction loss and prediction loss, to enhance feature representation learning, resulting in accurate reconstruction and classification. Experimental results on two Android malware datasets demonstrate that MalPurifier outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses, and it significantly strengthens the vulnerable malware detector against 37 evasion attacks, achieving accuracies over 90.91%. Notably, MalPurifier demonstrates easy scalability to other detectors, offering flexibility and robustness in its implementation.

> Trajectory recovery based on the snapshots from the city-wide multi-camera network facilitates urban mobility sensing and driveway optimization. The state-of-the-art solutions devoted to such a vision-based scheme typically incorporate predefined rules or unsupervised iterative feedback, struggling with multi-fold challenges such as lack of open-source datasets for training the whole pipeline, and the vulnerability to the noises from visual inputs. In response to the dilemma, this paper proposes VisionTraj, the first learning-based model that reconstructs vehicle trajectories from snapshots recorded by road network cameras. Coupled with it, we elaborate on two rational vision-trajectory datasets, which produce extensive trajectory data along with corresponding visual snapshots, enabling supervised vision-trajectory interplay extraction. Following the data creation, based on the results from the off-the-shelf multi-modal vehicle clustering, we first re-formulate the trajectory recovery problem as a generative task and introduce the canonical Transformer as the autoregressive backbone. Then, to identify clustering noises (e.g., false positives) with the bound on the snapshots' spatiotemporal dependencies, a GCN-based soft-denoising module is conducted based on the fine- and coarse-grained Re-ID clusters. Additionally, we harness strong semantic information extracted from the tracklet to provide detailed insights into the vehicle's entry and exit actions during trajectory recovery. The denoising and tracklet components can also act as plug-and-play modules to boost baselines. Experimental results on the two hand-crafted datasets show that the proposed VisionTraj achieves a maximum +11.5% improvement against the sub-best model.

> Discovering causal structure from purely observational data (i.e., causal discovery), aiming to identify causal relationships among variables, is a fundamental task in machine learning. The recent invention of differentiable score-based DAG learners is a crucial enabler, which reframes the combinatorial optimization problem into a differentiable optimization with a DAG constraint over directed graph space. Despite their great success, these cutting-edge DAG learners incorporate DAG-ness independent score functions to evaluate the directed graph candidates, lacking in considering graph structure. As a result, measuring the data fitness alone regardless of DAG-ness inevitably leads to discovering suboptimal DAGs and model vulnerabilities. Towards this end, we propose a dynamic causal space for DAG structure learning, coined CASPER, that integrates the graph structure into the score function as a new measure in the causal space to faithfully reflect the causal distance between estimated and ground truth DAG. CASPER revises the learning process as well as enhances the DAG structure learning via adaptive attention to DAG-ness. Grounded by empirical visualization, CASPER, as a space, satisfies a series of desired properties, such as structure awareness and noise robustness. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets clearly validate the superiority of our CASPER over the state-of-the-art causal discovery methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

> Graph Lottery Tickets (GLTs), comprising a sparse adjacency matrix and a sparse graph neural network (GNN), can significantly reduce the inference latency and compute footprint compared to their dense counterparts. Despite these benefits, their performance against adversarial structure perturbations remains to be fully explored. In this work, we first investigate the resilience of GLTs against different structure perturbation attacks and observe that they are highly vulnerable and show a large drop in classification accuracy. Based on this observation, we then present an adversarially robust graph sparsification (ARGS) framework that prunes the adjacency matrix and the GNN weights by optimizing a novel loss function capturing the graph homophily property and information associated with both the true labels of the train nodes and the pseudo labels of the test nodes. By iteratively applying ARGS to prune both the perturbed graph adjacency matrix and the GNN model weights, we can find adversarially robust graph lottery tickets that are highly sparse yet achieve competitive performance under different untargeted training-time structure attacks. Evaluations conducted on various benchmarks, considering different poisoning structure attacks, namely, PGD, MetaAttack, Meta-PGD, and PR-BCD demonstrate that the GLTs generated by ARGS can significantly improve the robustness, even when subjected to high levels of sparsity.

> This study examines privacy risks in collaborative robotics, focusing on the potential for traffic analysis in encrypted robot communications. While previous research has explored low-level command recovery, our work investigates high-level motion recovery from command message sequences. We evaluate the efficacy of traditional website fingerprinting techniques (k-FP, KNN, and CUMUL) and their limitations in accurately identifying robotic actions due to their inability to capture detailed temporal relationships. To address this, we introduce a traffic classification approach using signal processing techniques, demonstrating high accuracy in action identification and highlighting the vulnerability of encrypted communications to privacy breaches. Additionally, we explore defenses such as packet padding and timing manipulation, revealing the challenges in balancing traffic analysis resistance with network efficiency. Our findings emphasize the need for continued development of practical defenses in robotic privacy and security.

> Microsoft Windows Feedback Hub is designed to receive customer feedback on a wide variety of subjects including critical topics such as power and battery. Feedback is one of the most effective ways to have a grasp of users' experience with Windows and its ecosystem. However, the sheer volume of feedback received by Feedback Hub makes it immensely challenging to diagnose the actual cause of reported issues. To better understand and triage issues, we leverage Double Machine Learning (DML) to associate users' feedback with telemetry signals. One of the main challenges we face in the DML pipeline is the necessity of domain knowledge for model design (e.g., causal graph), which sometimes is either not available or hard to obtain. In this work, we take advantage of reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a prior model that which to some extent compensates for the lack of domain knowledge and could be used as a heuristic for measuring feedback informativeness. Our LLM-based approach is able to extract previously known issues, uncover new bugs, and identify sequences of events that lead to a bug, while minimizing out-of-domain outputs.

- *Thomas Paniagua, Ryan Grainger, Tianfu Wu*

- `2312.11510v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11510v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11510v1)

> The adversarial vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been well-known and widely concerned, often under the context of learning top-$1$ attacks (e.g., fooling a DNN to classify a cat image as dog). This paper shows that the concern is much more serious by learning significantly more aggressive ordered top-$K$ clear-box~\footnote{ This is often referred to as white/black-box attacks in the literature. We choose to adopt neutral terminology, clear/opaque-box attacks in this paper, and omit the prefix clear-box for simplicity.} targeted attacks proposed in Adversarial Distillation. We propose a novel and rigorous quadratic programming (QP) method of learning ordered top-$K$ attacks with low computing cost, dubbed as \textbf{QuadAttac$K$}. Our QuadAttac$K$ directly solves the QP to satisfy the attack constraint in the feature embedding space (i.e., the input space to the final linear classifier), which thus exploits the semantics of the feature embedding space (i.e., the principle of class coherence). With the optimized feature embedding vector perturbation, it then computes the adversarial perturbation in the data space via the vanilla one-step back-propagation. In experiments, the proposed QuadAttac$K$ is tested in the ImageNet-1k classification using ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and Vision Transformers (ViT-B and DEiT-S). It successfully pushes the boundary of successful ordered top-$K$ attacks from $K=10$ up to $K=20$ at a cheap budget ($1\times 60$) and further improves attack success rates for $K=5$ for all tested models, while retaining the performance for $K=1$.

- *Hiroya Kato, Kento Hasegawa, Seira Hidano, Kazuhide Fukushima*

- `2312.07022v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07022v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07022v1)

> Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is unsupervised graph representation learning that can obtain useful representation of unknown nodes. The node representation can be utilized as features of downstream tasks. However, GCL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks as with existing learning models. A state-of-the-art defense cannot sufficiently negate adverse effects by poisoned graphs although such a defense introduces adversarial training in the GCL. To achieve further improvement, pruning adversarial edges is important. To the best of our knowledge, the feasibility remains unexplored in the GCL domain. In this paper, we propose a simple defense for GCL, EdgePruner. We focus on the fact that the state-of-the-art poisoning attack on GCL tends to mainly add adversarial edges to create poisoned graphs, which means that pruning edges is important to sanitize the graphs. Thus, EdgePruner prunes edges that contribute to minimizing the contrastive loss based on the node representation obtained after training on poisoned graphs by GCL. Furthermore, we focus on the fact that nodes with distinct features are connected by adversarial edges in poisoned graphs. Thus, we introduce feature similarity between neighboring nodes to help more appropriately determine adversarial edges. This similarity is helpful in further eliminating adverse effects from poisoned graphs on various datasets. Finally, EdgePruner outputs a graph that yields the minimum contrastive loss as the sanitized graph. Our results demonstrate that pruning adversarial edges is feasible on six datasets. EdgePruner can improve the accuracy of node classification under the attack by up to 5.55% compared with that of the state-of-the-art defense. Moreover, we show that EdgePruner is immune to an adaptive attack.

- `2311.02582v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02582v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02582v2)

> Recently, permissioned blockchain has been extensively explored in various fields, such as asset management, supply chain, healthcare, and many others. Many scholars are dedicated to improving its verifiability, scalability, and performance based on sharding techniques, including grouping nodes and handling cross-shard transactions. However, they ignore the node vulnerability problem, i.e., there is no guarantee that nodes will not be maliciously controlled throughout their life cycle. Facing this challenge, we propose RecAGT, a novel identification scheme aimed at reducing communication overhead and identifying potential malicious nodes. First, shard testable codes are designed to encode the original data in case of a leak of confidential data. Second, a new identity proof protocol is presented as evidence against malicious behavior. Finally, adaptive group testing is chosen to identify malicious nodes. Notably, our work focuses on the internal operation within the committee and can thus be applied to any sharding permissioned blockchains. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can effectively identify malicious nodes with low communication and computational costs.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become widely used in the field of graph mining. However, these networks are vulnerable to structural perturbations. While many research efforts have focused on analyzing vulnerability through poisoning attacks, we have identified an inefficiency in current attack losses. These losses steer the attack strategy towards modifying edges targeting misclassified nodes or resilient nodes, resulting in a waste of structural adversarial perturbation. To address this issue, we propose a novel attack loss framework called the Cost Aware Poisoning Attack (CA-attack) to improve the allocation of the attack budget by dynamically considering the classification margins of nodes. Specifically, it prioritizes nodes with smaller positive margins while postponing nodes with negative margins. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed CA-attack significantly enhances existing attack strategies

> Intelligent robots rely on object detection models to perceive the environment. Following advances in deep learning security it has been revealed that object detection models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, prior research primarily focuses on attacking static images or offline videos. Therefore, it is still unclear if such attacks could jeopardize real-world robotic applications in dynamic environments. This paper bridges this gap by presenting the first real-time online attack against object detection models. We devise three attacks that fabricate bounding boxes for nonexistent objects at desired locations. The attacks achieve a success rate of about 90% within about 20 iterations. The demo video is available at https://youtu.be/zJZ1aNlXsMU.

> With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in code generation, enabling LLMs to transform natural language into programming code. These Code LLMs have been widely accepted by massive users and organizations. However, a dangerous nature is hidden in the code, which is the existence of fatal vulnerabilities. While some LLM providers have attempted to address these issues by aligning with human guidance, these efforts fall short of making Code LLMs practical and robust. Without a deep understanding of the performance of the LLMs under the practical worst cases, it would be concerning to apply them to various real-world applications. In this paper, we answer the critical issue: Are existing Code LLMs immune to generating vulnerable code? If not, what is the possible maximum severity of this issue in practical deployment scenarios? In this paper, we introduce DeceptPrompt, a novel algorithm that can generate adversarial natural language instructions that drive the Code LLMs to generate functionality correct code with vulnerabilities. DeceptPrompt is achieved through a systematic evolution-based algorithm with a fine grain loss design. The unique advantage of DeceptPrompt enables us to find natural prefix/suffix with totally benign and non-directional semantic meaning, meanwhile, having great power in inducing the Code LLMs to generate vulnerable code. This feature can enable us to conduct the almost-worstcase red-teaming on these LLMs in a real scenario, where users are using natural language. Our extensive experiments and analyses on DeceptPrompt not only validate the effectiveness of our approach but also shed light on the huge weakness of LLMs in the code generation task. When applying the optimized prefix/suffix, the attack success rate (ASR) will improve by average 50% compared with no prefix/suffix applying.

> In an open-bid auction, a bidder can know the budgets of other bidders. Thus, a sealed-bid auction that hides bidding prices is desirable. However, in previous sealed-bid auction protocols, it has been difficult to provide a ``fund binding'' property, which would guarantee that a bidder has funds more than or equal to the bidding price and that the funds are forcibly withdrawn when the bidder wins. Thus, such protocols are vulnerable to false bidding. As a solution, many protocols employ a simple deposit method in which each bidder sends a deposit to a smart contract, which is greater than or equal to the bidding price, before the bidding phase. However, this deposit reveals the maximum bidding price, and it is preferable to hide this information.   In this paper, we propose a sealed-bid auction protocol that provides a fund binding property. Our protocol not only hides the bidding price and a maximum bidding price, but also provides fund binding, simultaneously. For hiding the maximum bidding price, we pay attention to the fact that usual Ethereum transactions and transactions for sending funds to a one-time address have the same transaction structure, and it seems that they are indistinguishable. We discuss how much bidding transactions are hidden. We also employ DECO (Zhang et al,. CCS 2020) that proves the validity of the data to a verifier in which the data are taken from a source without showing the data itself. Finally, we give our implementation which shows transaction fees required and compare it to a sealed-bid auction protocol employing the simple deposit method.

> Radio signal classification plays a pivotal role in identifying the modulation scheme used in received radio signals, which is essential for demodulation and proper interpretation of the transmitted information. Researchers have underscored the high susceptibility of ML algorithms for radio signal classification to adversarial attacks. Such vulnerability could result in severe consequences, including misinterpretation of critical messages, interception of classified information, or disruption of communication channels. Recent advancements in quantum computing have revolutionized theories and implementations of computation, bringing the unprecedented development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). It is shown that quantum variational classifiers (QVCs) provide notably enhanced robustness against classical adversarial attacks in image classification. However, no research has yet explored whether QML can similarly mitigate adversarial threats in the context of radio signal classification. This work applies QVCs to radio signal classification and studies their robustness to various adversarial attacks. We also propose the novel application of the approximate amplitude encoding (AAE) technique to encode radio signal data efficiently. Our extensive simulation results present that attacks generated on QVCs transfer well to CNN models, indicating that these adversarial examples can fool neural networks that they are not explicitly designed to attack. However, the converse is not true. QVCs primarily resist the attacks generated on CNNs. Overall, with comprehensive simulations, our results shed new light on the growing field of QML by bridging knowledge gaps in QAML in radio signal classification and uncovering the advantages of applying QML methods in practical applications.

> Due to the increasing sophistication of web attacks, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) have to be tested and updated regularly to resist the relentless flow of web attacks. In practice, using a brute-force attack to discover vulnerabilities is infeasible due to the wide variety of attack patterns. Thus, various black-box testing techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, these techniques suffer from low efficiency. This paper presents Reinforcement-Learning-Driven and Adaptive Testing (RAT), an automated black-box testing strategy to discover injection vulnerabilities in WAFs. In particular, we focus on SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting, which have been among the top ten vulnerabilities over the past decade. More specifically, RAT clusters similar attack samples together. It then utilizes a reinforcement learning technique combined with a novel adaptive search algorithm to discover almost all bypassing attack patterns efficiently. We compare RAT with three state-of-the-art methods considering their objectives. The experiments show that RAT performs 33.53% and 63.16% on average better than its counterparts in discovering the most possible bypassing payloads and reducing the number of attempts before finding the first bypassing payload when testing well-configured WAFs, respectively.

> A timely software update is vital to combat the increasing security vulnerabilities. However, some software vendors may secretly patch their vulnerabilities without creating CVE entries or even describing the security issue in their change log. Thus, it is critical to identify these hidden security patches and defeat potential N-day attacks. Researchers have employed various machine learning techniques to identify security patches in open-source software, leveraging the syntax and semantic features of the software changes and commit messages. However, all these solutions cannot be directly applied to the binary code, whose instructions and program flow may dramatically vary due to different compilation configurations. In this paper, we propose BinGo, a new security patch detection system for binary code. The main idea is to present the binary code as code property graphs to enable a comprehensive understanding of program flow and perform a language model over each basic block of binary code to catch the instruction semantics. BinGo consists of four phases, namely, patch data pre-processing, graph extraction, embedding generation, and graph representation learning. Due to the lack of an existing binary security patch dataset, we construct such a dataset by compiling the pre-patch and post-patch source code of the Linux kernel. Our experimental results show BinGo can achieve up to 80.77% accuracy in identifying security patches between two neighboring versions of binary code. Moreover, BinGo can effectively reduce the false positives and false negatives caused by the different compilers and optimization levels.

> Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) aims to recognize novel named entities in low-resource domains utilizing existing knowledge. However, the present few-shot NER models assume that the labeled data are all clean without noise or outliers, and there are few works focusing on the robustness of the cross-domain transfer learning ability to textual adversarial attacks in Few-shot NER. In this work, we comprehensively explore and assess the robustness of few-shot NER models under textual adversarial attack scenario, and found the vulnerability of existing few-shot NER models. Furthermore, we propose a robust two-stage few-shot NER method with Boundary Discrimination and Correlation Purification (BDCP). Specifically, in the span detection stage, the entity boundary discriminative module is introduced to provide a highly distinguishing boundary representation space to detect entity spans. In the entity typing stage, the correlations between entities and contexts are purified by minimizing the interference information and facilitating correlation generalization to alleviate the perturbations caused by textual adversarial attacks. In addition, we construct adversarial examples for few-shot NER based on public datasets Few-NERD and Cross-Dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on those two groups of few-shot NER datasets containing adversarial examples demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed method.

> Warning: this paper includes model outputs showing offensive content. Recent large-scale Visual-Language Generative Models (VLGMs) have achieved unprecedented improvement in multimodal image/text generation. However, these models might also generate toxic content, e.g., offensive text and pornography images, raising significant ethical risks. Despite exhaustive studies on toxic degeneration of language models, this problem remains largely unexplored within the context of visual-language generation. This work delves into the propensity for toxicity generation and susceptibility to toxic data across various VLGMs. For this purpose, we built ToViLaG, a dataset comprising 32K co-toxic/mono-toxic text-image pairs and 1K innocuous but evocative text that tends to stimulate toxicity. Furthermore, we propose WInToRe, a novel toxicity metric tailored to visual-language generation, which theoretically reflects different aspects of toxicity considering both input and output. On such a basis, we benchmarked the toxicity of a diverse spectrum of VLGMs and discovered that some models do more evil than expected while some are more vulnerable to infection, underscoring the necessity of VLGMs detoxification. Therefore, we develop an innovative bottleneck-based detoxification method. Our method could reduce toxicity while maintaining comparable generation quality, providing a promising initial solution to this line of research.

> A robust authentication and authorization mechanism is imperative in modular system development, where modularity and modular thinking are pivotal. Traditional systems often employ identity modules responsible for authentication and token issuance. Tokens, representing user credentials, offer advantages such as reduced reliance on passwords, limited lifespan, and scoped access. Despite these benefits, the "bearer token" problem persists, leaving systems vulnerable to abuse if tokens are compromised. We propose a token-based authentication mechanism addressing modular systems' critical bearer token problem. The proposed mechanism includes a novel RAF (Recursive Augmented Fernet) token, a blacklist component, and a policy enforcer component. RAF tokens are one-time-use tokens, like tickets. They carry commands, and the receiver of an RAF token can issue new tokens using the received RAF token. The blacklist component guarantees an RAF token can not be approved more than once, and the policy enforcer checks the compatibility of commands carried by an RAF token. We introduce two variations of RAF tokens: User-tied RAF, offering simplicity and compatibility, and Fully-tied RAF, providing enhanced security through service-specific secret keys. We thoroughly discuss the security guarantees, technical definitions, and construction of RAF tokens backed by game-based proofs. We demonstrate a proof of concept in the context of OpenStack, involving modifications to Keystone and creating an RAFT library. The experimental results reveal minimal overhead in typical scenarios, establishing the practicality and effectiveness of RAF. Our experiments show that the RAF mechanism beats the idea of using short-life Fernet tokens while providing much better security.

> Smart meters are of the basic elements in the so-called Smart Grid. These devices, connected to the Internet, keep bidirectional communication with other devices in the Smart Grid structure to allow remote readings and maintenance. As any other device connected to a network, smart meters become vulnerable to attacks with different purposes, like stealing data or altering readings. Nowadays, it is becoming more and more popular to buy and plug-and-play smart meters, additionally to those installed by the energy providers, to directly monitor the energy consumption at home. This option inherently entails security risks that are under the responsibility of householders. In this paper, we focus on an open solution based on Smartpi 2.0 devices with two purposes. On the one hand, we propose a network configuration and different data flows to exchange data (energy readings) in the home. These flows are designed to support collaborative among the devices in order to prevent external attacks and attempts of corrupting the data. On the other hand, we check the vulnerability by performing two kind of attacks (denial of service and stealing and changing data by using a malware). We conclude that, as expected, these devices are vulnerable to these attacks, but we provide mechanisms to detect both of them and to solve, by applying cooperation techniques

> Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent illness associated with Diabetes which, if left untreated, can result in irreversible blindness. Deep Learning based systems are gradually being introduced as automated support for clinical diagnosis. Since healthcare has always been an extremely important domain demanding error-free performance, any adversaries could pose a big threat to the applicability of such systems. In this work, we use Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) to quantify the vulnerability of Medical Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for detecting DR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt that works on attacking complete fine-grained classification of DR images using various UAPs. Also, as a part of this work, we use UAPs to fine-tune the trained models to defend against adversarial samples. We experiment on several models and observe that the performance of such models towards unseen adversarial attacks gets boosted on average by $3.41$ Cohen-kappa value and maximum by $31.92$ Cohen-kappa value. The performance degradation on normal data upon ensembling the fine-tuned models was found to be statistically insignificant using t-test, highlighting the benefits of UAP-based adversarial fine-tuning.

> In recent years, the security issues of artificial intelligence have become increasingly prominent due to the rapid development of deep learning research and applications. Backdoor attack is an attack targeting the vulnerability of deep learning models, where hidden backdoors are activated by triggers embedded by the attacker, thereby outputting malicious predictions that may not align with the intended output for a given input. In this work, we propose a novel black-box backdoor attack based on machine unlearning. The attacker first augments the training set with carefully designed samples, including poison and mitigation data, to train a `benign' model. Then, the attacker posts unlearning requests for the mitigation samples to remove the impact of relevant data on the model, gradually activating the hidden backdoor. Since backdoors are implanted during the iterative unlearning process, it significantly increases the computational overhead of existing defense methods for backdoor detection or mitigation. To address this new security threat, we proposes two methods for detecting or mitigating such malicious unlearning requests. We conduct the experiment in both exact unlearning and approximate unlearning (i.e., SISA) settings. Experimental results indicate that: 1) our attack approach can successfully implant backdoor into the model, and sharding increases the difficult of attack; 2) our detection algorithms are effective in identifying the mitigation samples, while sharding reduces the effectiveness of our detection algorithms.

> Ensuring the safety of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) is a longstanding topic in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, and the safety concerns associated with Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely investigated. Recently, large vision-language models (VLMs) represent an unprecedented revolution, as they are built upon LLMs but can incorporate additional modalities (e.g., images). However, the safety of VLMs lacks systematic evaluation, and there may be an overconfidence in the safety guarantees provided by their underlying LLMs. In this paper, to demonstrate that introducing additional modality modules leads to unforeseen AI safety issues, we propose FigStep, a straightforward yet effective jailbreaking algorithm against VLMs. Instead of feeding textual harmful instructions directly, FigStep converts the harmful content into images through typography to bypass the safety alignment within the textual module of the VLMs, inducing VLMs to output unsafe responses that violate common AI safety policies. In our evaluation, we manually review 46,500 model responses generated by 3 families of the promising open-source VLMs, i.e., LLaVA, MiniGPT4, and CogVLM (a total of 6 VLMs). The experimental results show that FigStep can achieve an average attack success rate of 82.50% on 500 harmful queries in 10 topics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the methodology of FigStep can even jailbreak GPT-4V, which already leverages an OCR detector to filter harmful queries. Above all, our work reveals that VLMs are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, which highlights the necessity of novel safety alignments between visual and textual modalities.

> Static analysis, the process of examining code without executing it, is crucial for identifying software issues. Yet, static analysis is hampered by its complexity and the need for customization for different targets. Traditional static analysis tools require extensive human effort and are often limited to specific target programs and programming languages. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, offer new capabilities for software engineering tasks. However, their application in static analysis, especially in understanding complex code structures, remains under-explored. This paper introduces a novel approach named E&V , which leverages LLMs to perform static analysis. Specifically, E&V employs LLMs to simulate the execution of pseudo-code, effectively conducting static analysis encoded in the pseudo-code with minimal human effort, thereby improving the accuracy of results. E&V includes a verification process for pseudo-code execution without needing an external oracle. This process allows E&V to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs and enhance the accuracy of static analysis results. We have implemented E&V in a prototype tool designed for triaging crashes through backward taint analysis. This prototype, paired with GPT-4-32k, has been applied to triage 170 recently fixed Linux kernel bugs across seven bug categories. Our experiments demonstrate that the prototype correctly identifies the blamed function in 81.2% of the cases. Additionally, we observe that our novel verification process significantly improves the accuracy, increasing it from 28.2% to 81.2%.

> Discovering new vulnerabilities and implementing security and privacy measures are important to protect systems and data against physical attacks. One such vulnerability is impedance, an inherent property of a device that can be exploited to leak information through an unintended side channel, thereby posing significant security and privacy risks. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, impedance is often overlooked or narrowly explored, as it is typically treated as a fixed value at a specific frequency in research and design endeavors. Moreover, impedance has never been explored as a source of information leakage. This paper demonstrates that the impedance of an embedded device is not constant and directly relates to the programs executed on the device. We define this phenomenon as impedance leakage and use this as a side channel to extract software instructions from protected memory. Our experiment on the ATmega328P microcontroller and the Artix 7 FPGA indicates that the impedance side channel can detect software instructions with 96.1% and 92.6% accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the dual nature of the impedance side channel, highlighting the potential for beneficial purposes and the associated risk of intellectual property theft. Finally, potential countermeasures that specifically address impedance leakage are discussed.

> Recent advancement in personalized image generation have unveiled the intriguing capability of pre-trained text-to-image models on learning identity information from a collection of portrait images. However, existing solutions are vulnerable in producing truthful details, and usually suffer from several defects such as (i) The generated face exhibit its own unique characteristics, \ie facial shape and facial feature positioning may not resemble key characteristics of the input, and (ii) The synthesized face may contain warped, blurred or corrupted regions. In this paper, we present FaceChain, a personalized portrait generation framework that combines a series of customized image-generation model and a rich set of face-related perceptual understanding models (\eg, face detection, deep face embedding extraction, and facial attribute recognition), to tackle aforementioned challenges and to generate truthful personalized portraits, with only a handful of portrait images as input. Concretely, we inject several SOTA face models into the generation procedure, achieving a more efficient label-tagging, data-processing, and model post-processing compared to previous solutions, such as DreamBooth ~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth} , InstantBooth ~\cite{shi2023instantbooth} , or other LoRA-only approaches ~\cite{hu2021lora} . Besides, based on FaceChain, we further develop several applications to build a broader playground for better showing its value, including virtual try on and 2D talking head. We hope it can grow to serve the burgeoning needs from the communities. Note that this is an ongoing work that will be consistently refined and improved upon.

- `2312.08651v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08651v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08651v1)

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight perturbations in the graph structure can lead to erroneous predictions. However, current robust models for defending against such attacks inherit the transductive limitations of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). As a result, they are constrained by fixed structures and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here, we discover that transductive GCNs inherently possess a distillable robustness, achieved through a wave-induced resonance process. Based on this, we foster this resonance to facilitate inductive and robust learning. Specifically, we first prove that the signal formed by GCN-driven message passing (MP) is equivalent to the edge-based Laplacian wave, where, within a wave system, resonance can naturally emerge between the signal and its transmitting medium. This resonance provides inherent resistance to malicious perturbations inflicted on the signal system. We then prove that merely three MP iterations within GCNs can induce signal resonance between nodes and edges, manifesting as a coupling between nodes and their distillable surrounding local subgraph. Consequently, we present Graph Resonance-fostering Network (GRN) to foster this resonance via learning node representations from their distilled resonating subgraphs. By capturing the edge-transmitted signals within this subgraph and integrating them with the node signal, GRN embeds these combined signals into the central node's representation. This node-wise embedding approach allows for generalization to unseen nodes. We validate our theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that GRN generalizes robustness to unseen nodes, whilst maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy on perturbed graphs.

> While DeepFake applications are becoming popular in recent years, their abuses pose a serious privacy threat. Unfortunately, most related detection algorithms to mitigate the abuse issues are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks because they are built atop DNN-based classification models, and the literature has demonstrated that they could be bypassed by introducing pixel-level perturbations. Though corresponding mitigation has been proposed, we have identified a new attribute-variation-based adversarial attack (AVA) that perturbs the latent space via a combination of Gaussian prior and semantic discriminator to bypass such mitigation. It perturbs the semantics in the attribute space of DeepFake images, which are inconspicuous to human beings (e.g., mouth open) but can result in substantial differences in DeepFake detection. We evaluate our proposed AVA attack on nine state-of-the-art DeepFake detection algorithms and applications. The empirical results demonstrate that AVA attack defeats the state-of-the-art black box attacks against DeepFake detectors and achieves more than a 95% success rate on two commercial DeepFake detectors. Moreover, our human study indicates that AVA-generated DeepFake images are often imperceptible to humans, which presents huge security and privacy concerns.

> Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable advances in sequential decision tasks. However, recent works have revealed that DRL agents are susceptible to slight perturbations in observations. This vulnerability raises concerns regarding the effectiveness and robustness of deploying such agents in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel robust reinforcement learning method called SortRL, which improves the robustness of DRL policies against observation perturbations from the perspective of the network architecture. We employ a novel architecture for the policy network that incorporates global $l_\infty$ Lipschitz continuity and provide a convenient method to enhance policy robustness based on the output margin. Besides, a training framework is designed for SortRL, which solves given tasks while maintaining robustness against $l_\infty$ bounded perturbations on the observations. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, including classic control tasks and video games. The results demonstrate that SortRL achieves state-of-the-art robustness performance against different perturbation strength.

> Due to the widespread availability of data, machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly being implemented in distributed topologies, wherein various nodes collaborate to train ML models via the coordination of a central server. However, distributed learning approaches face significant vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from two potential threats. Firstly, the presence of Byzantine nodes poses a risk of corrupting the learning process by transmitting inaccurate information to the server. Secondly, a curious server may compromise the privacy of individual nodes, sometimes reconstructing the entirety of the nodes' data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) has emerged as a leading security measure to preserve privacy in distributed learning under non-Byzantine scenarios. However, the extensive computational demands of HE, particularly for high-dimensional ML models, have deterred attempts to design purely homomorphic operators for non-linear robust aggregators. This paper introduces SABLE, the first homomorphic and Byzantine robust distributed learning algorithm. SABLE leverages HTS, a novel and efficient homomorphic operator implementing the prominent coordinate-wise trimmed mean robust aggregator. Designing HTS enables us to implement HMED, a novel homomorphic median aggregator. Extensive experiments on standard ML tasks demonstrate that SABLE achieves practical execution times while maintaining an ML accuracy comparable to its non-private counterpart.

> In our contemporary academic inquiry, we present "Diffusion-C," a foundational methodology to analyze the generative restrictions of Diffusion Models, particularly those akin to GANs, DDPM, and DDIM. By employing input visual data that has been subjected to a myriad of corruption modalities and intensities, we elucidate the performance characteristics of those Diffusion Models. The noise component takes center stage in our analysis, hypothesized to be a pivotal element influencing the mechanics of deep learning systems. In our rigorous expedition utilizing Diffusion-C, we have discerned the following critical observations: (I) Within the milieu of generative models under the Diffusion taxonomy, DDPM emerges as a paragon, consistently exhibiting superior performance metrics. (II) Within the vast spectrum of corruption frameworks, the fog and fractal corruptions notably undermine the functional robustness of both DDPM and DDIM. (III) The vulnerability of Diffusion Models to these particular corruptions is significantly influenced by topological and statistical similarities, particularly concerning the alignment between mean and variance. This scholarly work highlights Diffusion-C's core understandings regarding the impacts of various corruptions, setting the stage for future research endeavors in the realm of generative models.

> Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enhances users privacy by eliminating the need for clients to share raw, private data with the server. Despite the success, recent studies expose the vulnerability of FL to model inversion attacks, where adversaries reconstruct users private data via eavesdropping on the shared gradient information. We hypothesize that a key factor in the success of such attacks is the low entanglement among gradients per data within the batch during stochastic optimization. This creates a vulnerability that an adversary can exploit to reconstruct the sensitive data. Building upon this insight, we present a simple, yet effective defense strategy that obfuscates the gradients of the sensitive data with concealed samples. To achieve this, we propose synthesizing concealed samples to mimic the sensitive data at the gradient level while ensuring their visual dissimilarity from the actual sensitive data. Compared to the previous art, our empirical evaluations suggest that the proposed technique provides the strongest protection while simultaneously maintaining the FL performance.

> Recent studies have shown that contrastive learning, like supervised learning, is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks wherein malicious functions are injected into target models, only to be activated by specific triggers. However, thus far it remains under-explored how contrastive backdoor attacks fundamentally differ from their supervised counterparts, which impedes the development of effective defenses against the emerging threat.   This work represents a solid step toward answering this critical question. Specifically, we define TRL, a unified framework that encompasses both supervised and contrastive backdoor attacks. Through the lens of TRL, we uncover that the two types of attacks operate through distinctive mechanisms: in supervised attacks, the learning of benign and backdoor tasks tends to occur independently, while in contrastive attacks, the two tasks are deeply intertwined both in their representations and throughout their learning processes. This distinction leads to the disparate learning dynamics and feature distributions of supervised and contrastive attacks. More importantly, we reveal that the specificities of contrastive backdoor attacks entail important implications from a defense perspective: existing defenses for supervised attacks are often inadequate and not easily retrofitted to contrastive attacks. We also explore several alternative defenses and discuss their potential challenges. Our findings highlight the need for defenses tailored to the specificities of contrastive backdoor attacks, pointing to promising directions for future research.

> Children encounter misinformation on social media in a similar capacity as their parents. Unlike their parents, children are an exceptionally vulnerable population because their cognitive abilities and emotional regulation are still maturing, rendering them more susceptible to misinformation and falsehoods online. Yet, little is known about children's experience with misinformation as well as what their parents think of the misinformation's effect on child development. To answer these questions, we combined a qualitative survey of parents (n=87) with semi-structured interviews of both parents and children (n=12). We found that children usually encounter deep fakes, memes with political context, or celebrity/influencer rumors on social media. Children revealed they "ask Siri" whether a social media video or post is true or not before they search on Google or ask their parents about it. Parents expressed discontent that their children are impressionable to misinformation, stating that the burden falls on them to help their children develop critical thinking skills for navigating falsehoods on social media. Here, the majority of parents felt that schools should also teach these skills as well as media literacy to their children. Misinformation, according to both parents and children affects the family relationships especially with grandparents with different political views than theirs.

> While federated learning is promising for privacy-preserving collaborative learning without revealing local data, it remains vulnerable to white-box attacks and struggles to adapt to heterogeneous clients. Federated distillation (FD), built upon knowledge distillation--an effective technique for transferring knowledge from a teacher model to student models--emerges as an alternative paradigm, which provides enhanced privacy guarantees and addresses model heterogeneity. Nevertheless, challenges arise due to variations in local data distributions and the absence of a well-trained teacher model, which leads to misleading and ambiguous knowledge sharing that significantly degrades model performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a selective knowledge sharing mechanism for FD, termed Selective-FD. It includes client-side selectors and a server-side selector to accurately and precisely identify knowledge from local and ensemble predictions, respectively. Empirical studies, backed by theoretical insights, demonstrate that our approach enhances the generalization capabilities of the FD framework and consistently outperforms baseline methods.

> In software development, developers extensively utilize third-party libraries to avoid implementing existing functionalities. When a new third-party library vulnerability is disclosed, project maintainers need to determine whether their projects are affected by the vulnerability, which requires developers to invest substantial effort in assessment. However, existing tools face a series of issues: static analysis tools produce false alarms, dynamic analysis tools require existing tests and test generation tools have low success rates when facing complex vulnerabilities.   Vulnerability exploits, as code snippets provided for reproducing vulnerabilities after disclosure, contain a wealth of vulnerability-related information. This study proposes a new method based on vulnerability exploits, called VESTA (Vulnerability Exploit-based Software Testing Auto-Generator), which provides vulnerability exploit tests as the basis for developers to decide whether to update dependencies. VESTA extends the search-based test generation methods by adding a migration step, ensuring the similarity between the generated test and the vulnerability exploit, which increases the likelihood of detecting potential library vulnerabilities in a project.   We perform experiments on 30 vulnerabilities disclosed in the past five years, involving 60 vulnerability-project pairs, and compare the experimental results with the baseline method, TRANSFER. The success rate of VESTA is 71.7\% which is a 53.4\% improvement over TRANSFER in the effectiveness of verifying exploitable vulnerabilities.

> Debugging physical computing projects provides a rich context to understand cross-disciplinary problem solving that integrates multiple domains of computing and engineering. Yet understanding and assessing students' learning of debugging remains a challenge, particularly in understudied areas such as physical computing, since finding and fixing hardware and software bugs is a deeply contextual practice. In this paper we draw on the rich history of clinical interviews to develop and pilot "failure artifact scenarios" in order to study changes in students' approaches to debugging and troubleshooting electronic textiles (e-textiles). We applied this clinical interview protocol before and after an eight-week-long e-textiles unit. We analyzed pre/post clinical interviews from 18 students at four different schools. The analysis revealed that students improved in identifying bugs with greater specificity, and across domains, and in considering multiple causes for bugs. We discuss implications for developing tools to assess students' debugging abilities through contextualized debugging scenarios in physical computing.

> Since the advent of Spectre attacks, researchers and practitioners have developed a range of hardware and software measures to counter transient execution attacks. A prime example of such mitigation is speculative load hardening in LLVM, which protects against leaks by tracking the speculation state and masking values during misspeculation. LLVM relies on static analysis to harden programs using slh that often results in over-protection, which incurs performance overhead. We extended an existing side-channel model validation framework, Scam-V, to check the vulnerability of programs to Spectre-PHT attacks and optimize the protection of programs using the slh approach. We illustrate the efficacy of Scam-V by first demonstrating that it can automatically identify Spectre vulnerabilities in real programs, e.g., fragments of crypto-libraries. We then develop an optimization mechanism that validates the necessity of slh hardening w.r.t. the target platform. Our experiments showed that hardening introduced by LLVM in most cases could be significantly improved when the underlying microarchitecture properties are considered.

> Asset owner identification is an important first step for any information security organization, allowing organizations the ability to identify and detect data breaches and losses, vulnerabilities, possible attack surfaces, and define effective countermeasures. Using existing asset ownership data, the research utilized an assortment of machine learning algorithms to determine the best classification model to predict an asset's owner. The research ran separate analyses for each enumerated team, then ran a 100 iteration Monte Carlo Cross Validation across Adaboost, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees, and Random Forests. Finally, a visualization dashboard was created to help users understand the asset inventory through interactive exploratory data analysis as well as the ability to understand model evaluation metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each model. Overall, Adaboost performed the best across all owners with low testing errors below 5% while Naive Bayes performed the worst. The remaining models performed similarly. The fully qualified domain name (FQDN), Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) CIDR/16, and location were among the most important features.

> This paper proposes a cyber-physical architecture for the secured social operation of isolated hybrid microgrids (HMGs). On the physical side of the proposed architecture, an optimal scheduling scheme considering various renewable energy sources (RESs) and fossil fuel-based distributed generation units (DGs) is proposed. Regarding the cyber layer of MGs, a wireless architecture based on low range wide area (LORA) technology is introduced for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart electricity grids. In the proposed architecture, the LORA data frame is described in detail and designed for the application of smart meters considering DGs and ac-dc converters. Additionally, since the cyber layer of smart grids is highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, t1his paper proposes a deep-learning-based cyber-attack detection model (CADM) based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) to detect false data injection attacks (FDIA) on the smart meters within AMI. The performance of the proposed energy management architecture is evaluated using the IEEE 33-bus test system. In order to investigate the effect of FDIA on the isolated HMGs and highlight the interactions between the cyber layer and physical layer, an FDIA is launched against the test system. The results showed that a successful attack can highly damage the system and cause widespread load shedding. Also, the performance of the proposed CADM is examined using a real-world dataset. Results prove the effectiveness of the proposed CADM in detecting the attacks using only two samples.

> Graph neural network (GNN), the mainstream method to learn on graph data, is vulnerable to graph evasion attacks, where an attacker slightly perturbing the graph structure can fool trained GNN models. Existing work has at least one of the following drawbacks: 1) limited to directly attack two-layer GNNs; 2) inefficient; and 3) impractical, as they need to know full or part of GNN model parameters.   We address the above drawbacks and propose an influence-based \emph{efficient, direct, and restricted black-box} evasion attack to \emph{any-layer} GNNs. Specifically, we first introduce two influence functions, i.e., feature-label influence and label influence, that are defined on GNNs and label propagation (LP), respectively. Then we observe that GNNs and LP are strongly connected in terms of our defined influences. Based on this, we can then reformulate the evasion attack to GNNs as calculating label influence on LP, which is \emph{inherently} applicable to any-layer GNNs, while no need to know information about the internal GNN model. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate label influence. Experimental results on various graph datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art white-box attacks, our attack can achieve comparable attack performance, but has a 5-50x speedup when attacking two-layer GNNs. Moreover, our attack is effective to attack multi-layer GNNs\footnote{Source code and full version is in the link: \url{https://github.com/ventr1c/InfAttack}}.

> Neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown great success in information retrieval (IR). But their predictions can easily be manipulated using adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations to legitimate documents. This vulnerability raises significant concerns about their reliability and hinders the widespread deployment of NRMs. By incorporating adversarial examples into training data, adversarial training has become the de facto defense approach to adversarial attacks against NRMs. However, this defense mechanism is subject to a trade-off between effectiveness and adversarial robustness. In this study, we establish theoretical guarantees regarding the effectiveness-robustness trade-off in NRMs. We decompose the robust ranking error into two components, i.e., a natural ranking error for effectiveness evaluation and a boundary ranking error for assessing adversarial robustness. Then, we define the perturbation invariance of a ranking model and prove it to be a differentiable upper bound on the boundary ranking error for attainable computation. Informed by our theoretical analysis, we design a novel \emph{perturbation-invariant adversarial training} (PIAT) method for ranking models to achieve a better effectiveness-robustness trade-off. We design a regularized surrogate loss, in which one term encourages the effectiveness to be maximized while the regularization term encourages the output to be smooth, so as to improve adversarial robustness. Experimental results on several ranking models demonstrate the superiority of PITA compared to existing adversarial defenses.

> Communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been proven to effectively promote cooperation among agents recently. Since communication in real-world scenarios is vulnerable to noises and adversarial attacks, it is crucial to develop robust communicative MARL technique. However, existing research in this domain has predominantly focused on passive defense strategies, where agents receive all messages equally, making it hard to balance performance and robustness. We propose an active defense strategy, where agents automatically reduce the impact of potentially harmful messages on the final decision. There are two challenges to implement this strategy, that are defining unreliable messages and adjusting the unreliable messages' impact on the final decision properly. To address them, we design an Active Defense Multi-Agent Communication framework (ADMAC), which estimates the reliability of received messages and adjusts their impact on the final decision accordingly with the help of a decomposable decision structure. The superiority of ADMAC over existing methods is validated by experiments in three communication-critical tasks under four types of attacks.

> Crash bugs cause unexpected program behaviors or even termination, requiring high-priority resolution. However, manually resolving crash bugs is challenging and labor-intensive, and researchers have proposed various techniques for their automated localization and repair. ChatGPT, a recent large language model (LLM), has garnered significant attention due to its exceptional performance across various domains. This work performs the first investigation into ChatGPT's capability in resolve real-world crash bugs, focusing on its effectiveness in both localizing and repairing code-related and environment-related crash bugs. Specifically, we initially assess ChatGPT's fundamental ability to resolve crash bugs with basic prompts in a single iteration. We observe that ChatGPT performs better at resolving code-related crash bugs compared to environment-related ones, and its primary challenge in resolution lies in inaccurate localization. Additionally, we explore ChatGPT's potential with various advanced prompts. Furthermore, by stimulating ChatGPT's self-planning, it methodically investigates each potential crash-causing environmental factor through proactive inquiry, ultimately identifying the root cause of the crash. Based on our findings, we propose IntDiagSolver, an interaction methodology designed to facilitate precise crash bug resolution through continuous interaction with LLMs. Evaluating IntDiagSolver on multiple LLMs reveals consistent enhancement in the accuracy of crash bug resolution, including ChatGPT, Claude, and CodeLlama.

> Wasm runtime is a fundamental component in the Wasm ecosystem, as it directly impacts whether Wasm applications can be executed as expected. Bugs in Wasm runtime bugs are frequently reported, thus our research community has made a few attempts to design automated testing frameworks for detecting bugs in Wasm runtimes. However, existing testing frameworks are limited by the quality of test cases, i.e., they face challenges of generating both semantic-rich and syntactic-correct Wasm binaries, thus complicated bugs cannot be triggered. In this work, we present WRTester, a novel differential testing framework that can generated complicated Wasm test cases by disassembling and assembling of real-world Wasm binaries, which can trigger hidden inconsistencies among Wasm runtimes. For further pinpointing the root causes of unexpected behaviors, we design a runtime-agnostic root cause location method to accurately locate bugs. Extensive evaluation suggests that WRTester outperforms SOTA techniques in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. We have uncovered 33 unique bugs in popular Wasm runtimes, among which 25 have been confirmed.

> ChatGPT is currently the most popular large language model (LLM), with over 100 million users, making a significant impact on people's lives. However, due to the presence of jailbreak vulnerabilities, ChatGPT might have negative effects on people's lives, potentially even facilitating criminal activities. Testing whether ChatGPT can cause jailbreak is crucial because it can enhance ChatGPT's security, reliability, and social responsibility. Inspired by previous research revealing the varied performance of LLMs in different language translations, we suspected that wrapping prompts in multiple languages might lead to ChatGPT jailbreak. To investigate this, we designed a study with a fuzzing testing approach to analyzing ChatGPT's cross-linguistic proficiency. Our study includes three strategies by automatically posing different formats of malicious questions to ChatGPT: (1) each malicious question involving only one language, (2) multilingual malicious questions, (3) specifying that ChatGPT responds in a language different from the prompts. In addition, we also combine our strategies by utilizing prompt injection templates to wrap the three aforementioned types of questions. We examined a total of 7,892 Q&A data points, discovering that multilingual wrapping can indeed lead to ChatGPT's jailbreak, with different wrapping methods having varying effects on jailbreak probability. Prompt injection can amplify the probability of jailbreak caused by multilingual wrapping. This work provides insights for OpenAI developers to enhance ChatGPT's support for language diversity and inclusion.

> The IEEE 802.11 family of standards, better known as WiFi, is a widely used protocol utilized by billions of users. Previous works on WiFi formal verification have mostly focused on the four-way handshake and other security aspects. However, recent works have uncovered severe vulnerabilities in functional aspects of WiFi, which can cause information leakage for billions of devices. No formal analysis method exists able to reason on the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol. In this paper, we take the first steps in addressing this gap and present an extensive formal analysis of the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol, more specifically, the fragmentation and the power-save-mode process. To achieve this, we design a novel segment-based formal verification process and introduce a practical threat model (i.e. MAC spoofing) in Tamarin to reason about the various capabilities of the attacker. To this end, we verify 68 properties extracted from WiFi protocol specification, find 3 vulnerabilities from the verification, verify 3 known attacks, and discover 2 new issues. These vulnerabilities and issues affect 14 commercial devices out of 17 tested cases, showing the prevalence and impact of the issues. Apart from this, we show that the proposed countermeasures indeed are sufficient to address the issues. We hope our results and analysis will help vendors adopt the countermeasures and motivate further research into the verification of the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol.

> GUI testing is significant in the SE community. Most existing frameworks are intrusive and only support some specific platforms. With the development of distinct scenarios, diverse embedded systems or customized operating systems on different devices do not support existing intrusive GUI testing frameworks. Some approaches adopt robotic arms to replace the interface invoking of mobile apps under test and use computer vision technologies to identify GUI elements. However, some challenges are unsolved. First, existing approaches assume that GUI screens are fixed so that they cannot be adapted to diverse systems with different screen conditions. Second, existing approaches use XY-plane robotic arms, which cannot flexibly simulate testing operations. Third, existing approaches ignore compatibility bugs and only focus on crash bugs. A more practical approach is required for the non-intrusive scenario. We propose a practical non-intrusive GUI testing framework with visual robotic arms. RoboTest integrates novel GUI screen and widget detection algorithms, adaptive to detecting screens of different sizes and then to extracting GUI widgets from the detected screens. Then, a set of testing operations is applied with a 4-DOF robotic arm, which effectively and flexibly simulates human testing operations. During app exploration, RoboTest integrates the Principle of Proximity-guided exploration strategy, choosing close widgets of the previous targets to reduce robotic arm movement overhead and improve exploration efficiency. RoboTest can effectively detect some compatibility bugs beyond crash bugs with a GUI comparison on different devices of the same test operations. We evaluate RoboTest with 20 mobile apps, with a case study on an embedded system. The results show that RoboTest can effectively, efficiently, and generally explore AUTs to find bugs and reduce exploration time overhead.

> Street-level bureaucrats interact directly with people on behalf of government agencies to perform a wide range of functions, including, for example, administering social services and policing. A key feature of street-level bureaucracy is that the civil servants, while tasked with implementing agency policy, are also granted significant discretion in how they choose to apply that policy in individual cases. Using that discretion could be beneficial, as it allows for exceptions to policies based on human interactions and evaluations, but it could also allow biases and inequities to seep into important domains of societal resource allocation. In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to understand street-level bureaucrats' behavior. We leverage a rich dataset that combines demographic and other information on households with information on which homelessness interventions they were assigned during a period when assignments were not formulaic. We find that caseworker decisions in this time are highly predictable overall, and some, but not all of this predictivity can be captured by simple decision rules. We theorize that the decisions not captured by the simple decision rules can be considered applications of caseworker discretion. These discretionary decisions are far from random in both the characteristics of such households and in terms of the outcomes of the decisions. Caseworkers typically only apply discretion to households that would be considered less vulnerable. When they do apply discretion to assign households to more intensive interventions, the marginal benefits to those households are significantly higher than would be expected if the households were chosen at random; there is no similar reduction in marginal benefit to households that are discretionarily allocated less intensive interventions, suggesting that caseworkers are improving outcomes using their knowledge.

> Blockchain transactions have gained widespread adoption across various industries, largely attributable to their unparalleled transparency and robust security features. Nevertheless, this technique introduces various privacy concerns, including pseudonymity, Sybil attacks, and potential susceptibilities to quantum computing, to name a few. In response to these challenges, innovative privacy-enhancing solutions like zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and stealth addresses (SA) have been developed. Among the various schemes, SA stands out as it prevents the association of a blockchain transaction's output with the recipient's public address, thereby ensuring transactional anonymity. However, the basic SA schemes have exhibited vulnerabilities to key leakage and quantum computing attacks. To address these shortcomings, we present a pioneering solution - Homomorphic Encryption-based Dual-Key Stealth Address Protocol (HE-DKSAP), which can be further extended to Fully HE-DKSAP (FHE-DKSAP). By leveraging the power of homomorphic encryption, HE-DKSAP introduces a novel approach to safeguarding transaction privacy and preventing potential quantum computing attacks. This paper delves into the core principles of HE-DKSAP, highlighting its capacity to enhance privacy, scalability, and security in programmable blockchains. Through a comprehensive exploration of its design architecture, security analysis, and practical implementations, this work establishes a privacy-preserving, practical, and efficient stealth address protocol via additively homomorphic encryption.

> The rapid development of Machine Learning (ML) has demonstrated superior performance in many areas, such as computer vision, video and speech recognition. It has now been increasingly leveraged in software systems to automate the core tasks. However, how to securely develop the machine learning-based modern software systems (MLBSS) remains a big challenge, for which the insufficient consideration will largely limit its application in safety-critical domains. One concern is that the present MLBSS development tends to be rush, and the latent vulnerabilities and privacy issues exposed to external users and attackers will be largely neglected and hard to be identified. Additionally, machine learning-based software systems exhibit different liabilities towards novel vulnerabilities at different development stages from requirement analysis to system maintenance, due to its inherent limitations from the model and data and the external adversary capabilities. The successful generation of such intelligent systems will thus solicit dedicated efforts jointly from different research areas, i.e., software engineering, system security and machine learning. Most of the recent works regarding the security issues for ML have a strong focus on the data and models, which has brought adversarial attacks into consideration. In this work, we consider that security for machine learning-based software systems may arise from inherent system defects or external adversarial attacks, and the secure development practices should be taken throughout the whole lifecycle. While machine learning has become a new threat domain for existing software engineering practices, there is no such review work covering the topic. Overall, we present a holistic review regarding the security for MLBSS, which covers a systematic understanding from a structure review of three distinct aspects in terms of security threats...

> As open-source AI software projects become an integral component in the AI software development, it is critical to develop a novel methods to ensure and measure the security of the open-source projects for developers. Code ownership, pivotal in the evolution of such projects, offers insights into developer engagement and potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we leverage the code ownership metrics to empirically investigate the correlation with the latent vulnerabilities across five prominent open-source AI software projects. The findings from the large-scale empirical study suggest a positive relationship between high-level ownership (characterised by a limited number of minor contributors) and a decrease in vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce the time metrics, anchored on the project's duration, individual source code file timelines, and the count of impacted releases. These metrics adeptly categorise distinct phases of open-source AI software projects and their respective vulnerability intensities. With these novel code ownership metrics, we have implemented a Python-based command-line application to aid project curators and quality assurance professionals in evaluating and benchmarking their on-site projects. We anticipate this work will embark a continuous research development for securing and measuring open-source AI project security.

- `2310.18532v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18532v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18532v2)

> We introduce SkipAnalyzer, a large language model (LLM)-powered tool for static code analysis. SkipAnalyzer has three components: 1) an LLM-based static bug detector that scans source code and reports specific types of bugs, 2) an LLM-based false-positive filter that can identify false-positive bugs in the results of static bug detectors (e.g., the result of step 1) to improve detection accuracy, and 3) an LLM-based patch generator that can generate patches for the detected bugs above. As a proof-of-concept, SkipAnalyzer is built on ChatGPT, which has exhibited outstanding performance in various software engineering tasks. To evaluate SkipAnalyzer, we focus on two types of typical and critical bugs that are targeted by static bug detection, i.e., Null Dereference and Resource Leak as subjects. We employ Infer to aid the gathering of these two bug types from 10 open-source projects. Consequently, our experiment dataset contains 222 instances of Null Dereference bugs and 46 instances of Resource Leak bugs. Our study demonstrates that SkipAnalyzer achieves remarkable performance in the mentioned static analysis tasks, including bug detection, false-positive warning removal, and bug repair. In static bug detection, SkipAnalyzer achieves accuracy values of up to 68.37% for detecting Null Dereference bugs and 76.95% for detecting Resource Leak bugs, improving the precision of the current leading bug detector, Infer, by 12.86% and 43.13%, respectively. For removing false-positive warnings, SkipAnalyzer can reach a precision of up to 93.88% for Null Dereference bugs and 63.33% for Resource Leak bugs. Additionally, SkipAnalyzer surpasses state-of-the-art false-positive warning removal tools. Furthermore, in bug repair, SkipAnalyzer can generate syntactically correct patches to fix its detected bugs with a success rate of up to 97.30%.

> To reduce the computation cost and the energy consumption in large language models (LLM), skimming-based acceleration dynamically drops unimportant tokens of the input sequence progressively along layers of the LLM while preserving the tokens of semantic importance. However, our work for the first time reveals the acceleration may be vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose No-Skim, a general framework to help the owners of skimming-based LLM to understand and measure the robustness of their acceleration scheme. Specifically, our framework searches minimal and unnoticeable perturbations at character-level and token-level to generate adversarial inputs that sufficiently increase the remaining token ratio, thus increasing the computation cost and energy consumption. We systematically evaluate the vulnerability of the skimming acceleration in various LLM architectures including BERT and RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark. In the worst case, the perturbation found by No-Skim substantially increases the running cost of LLM by over 145% on average. Moreover, No-Skim extends the evaluation framework to various scenarios, making the evaluation conductible with different level of knowledge.

> Ensuring the security of large language models (LLMs) is an ongoing challenge despite their widespread popularity. Developers work to enhance LLMs security, but vulnerabilities persist, even in advanced versions like GPT-4. Attackers exploit these weaknesses, highlighting the need for proactive cybersecurity measures in AI model development. This article explores two attack categories: attacks on models themselves and attacks on model applications. The former requires expertise, access to model data, and significant implementation time, while the latter is more accessible to attackers and has seen increased attention. Our study reviews over 100 recent research works, providing an in-depth analysis of each attack type. We identify the latest attack methods and explore various approaches to carry them out. We thoroughly investigate mitigation techniques, assessing their effectiveness and limitations. Furthermore, we summarize future defenses against these attacks. We also examine real-world techniques, including reported and our implemented attacks on LLMs, to consolidate our findings. Our research highlights the urgency of addressing security concerns and aims to enhance the understanding of LLM attacks, contributing to robust defense development in this evolving domain.

> Multimodal content, such as mixing text with images, presents significant challenges to rumor detection in social media. Existing multimodal rumor detection has focused on mixing tokens among spatial and sequential locations for unimodal representation or fusing clues of rumor veracity across modalities. However, they suffer from less discriminative unimodal representation and are vulnerable to intricate location dependencies in the time-consuming fusion of spatial and sequential tokens. This work makes the first attempt at multimodal rumor detection in the frequency domain, which efficiently transforms spatial features into the frequency spectrum and obtains highly discriminative spectrum features for multimodal representation and fusion. A novel Frequency Spectrum Representation and fUsion network (FSRU) with dual contrastive learning reveals the frequency spectrum is more effective for multimodal representation and fusion, extracting the informative components for rumor detection. FSRU involves three novel mechanisms: utilizing the Fourier transform to convert features in the spatial domain to the frequency domain, the unimodal spectrum compression, and the cross-modal spectrum co-selection module in the frequency domain. Substantial experiments show that FSRU achieves satisfactory multimodal rumor detection performance.

However, the backdoor vulnerability, a serious security threat that can maliciously alter the victim model's normal predictions, has not been sufficiently explored for prompt-based LLMs. In this paper, we present POISONPROMPT, a novel backdoor attack capable of successfully compromising both hard and soft prompt-based LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness, fidelity, and robustness of POISONPROMPT through extensive experiments on three popular prompt methods, using six datasets and three widely used LLMs. Our findings highlight the potential security threats posed by backdoor attacks on prompt-based LLMs and emphasize the need for further research in this area.

> Federated learning allows clients to collaboratively train a global model without uploading raw data for privacy preservation. This feature, i.e., the inability to review participants' datasets, has recently been found responsible for federated learning's vulnerability in the face of backdoor attacks. Existing defense methods fall short from two perspectives: 1) they consider only very specific and limited attacker models and unable to cope with advanced backdoor attacks, such as distributed backdoor attacks, which break down the global trigger into multiple distributed triggers. 2) they conduct detection based on model granularity thus the performance gets impacted by the model dimension. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Layer Detection (FLD), a novel model filtering approach for effectively defending against backdoor attacks. FLD examines the models based on layer granularity to capture the complete model details and effectively detect potential backdoor models regardless of model dimension. We provide theoretical analysis and proof for the convergence of FLD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLD effectively mitigates state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with negligible impact on the accuracy of the primary task.

> Using only 34 published tables, we reconstruct five variables (census block, sex, age, race, and ethnicity) in the confidential 2010 Census person records. Using the 38-bin age variable tabulated at the census block level, at most 20.1% of reconstructed records can differ from their confidential source on even a single value for these five variables. Using only published data, an attacker can verify that all records in 70% of all census blocks (97 million people) are perfectly reconstructed. The tabular publications in Summary File 1 thus have prohibited disclosure risk similar to the unreleased confidential microdata. Reidentification studies confirm that an attacker can, within blocks with perfect reconstruction accuracy, correctly infer the actual census response on race and ethnicity for 3.4 million vulnerable population uniques (persons with nonmodal characteristics) with 95% accuracy, the same precision as the confidential data achieve and far greater than statistical baselines. The flaw in the 2010 Census framework was the assumption that aggregation prevented accurate microdata reconstruction, justifying weaker disclosure limitation methods than were applied to 2010 Census public microdata. The framework used for 2020 Census publications defends against attacks that are based on reconstruction, as we also demonstrate here. Finally, we show that alternatives to the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System with similar accuracy (enhanced swapping) also fail to protect confidentiality, and those that partially defend against reconstruction attacks (incomplete suppression implementations) destroy the primary statutory use case: data for redistricting all legislatures in the country in compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

> While there is universal agreement that agents ought to act ethically, there is no agreement as to what constitutes ethical behaviour. To address this problem, recent philosophical approaches to `moral uncertainty' propose aggregation of multiple ethical theories to guide agent behaviour. However, one of the foundational proposals for aggregation - Maximising Expected Choiceworthiness (MEC) - has been criticised as being vulnerable to fanaticism; the problem of an ethical theory dominating agent behaviour despite low credence (confidence) in said theory. Fanaticism thus undermines the `democratic' motivation for accommodating multiple ethical perspectives. The problem of fanaticism has not yet been mathematically defined. Representing moral uncertainty as an instance of social welfare aggregation, this paper contributes to the field of moral uncertainty by 1) formalising the problem of fanaticism as a property of social welfare functionals and 2) providing non-fanatical alternatives to MEC, i.e. Highest k-trimmed Mean and Highest Median.

> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI's codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants' language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future.

- `2312.11796v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11796v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11796v1)

> Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) allow user processes to create enclaves that protect security-sensitive computation against access from the OS kernel and the hypervisor. Recent work has shown that TEEs are vulnerable to side-channel attacks that allow an adversary to learn secrets shielded in enclaves. The majority of such attacks trigger exceptions or interrupts to trace the control or data flow of enclave execution.   We propose QuanShield, a system that protects enclaves from side-channel attacks that interrupt enclave execution. The main idea behind QuanShield is to strengthen resource isolation by creating an interrupt-free environment on a dedicated CPU core for running enclaves in which enclaves terminate when interrupts occur. QuanShield avoids interrupts by exploiting the tickless scheduling mode supported by recent OS kernels. QuanShield then uses the save area (SA) of the enclave, which is used by the hardware to support interrupt handling, as a second stack. Through an LLVM-based compiler pass, QuanShield modifies enclave instructions to store/load memory references, such as function frame base addresses, to/from the SA. When an interrupt occurs, the hardware overwrites the data in the SA with CPU state, thus ensuring that enclave execution fails. Our evaluation shows that QuanShield significantly raises the bar for interrupt-based attacks with practical overhead.

> Software defects consume 40% of the total budget in software development and cost the global economy billions of dollars every year. Unfortunately, despite the use of many software quality assurance (SQA) practices in software development (e.g., code review, continuous integration), defects may still exist in the official release of a software product. Therefore, prioritizing SQA efforts for the vulnerable areas of the codebase is essential to ensure the high quality of a software release. Predicting software defects at the line level could help prioritize the SQA effort but is a highly challenging task given that only ~3% of lines of a codebase could be defective. Existing works on line-level defect prediction often fall short and cannot fully leverage the line-level defect information. In this paper, we propose Bugsplorer, a novel deep-learning technique for line-level defect prediction. It leverages a hierarchical structure of transformer models to represent two types of code elements: code tokens and code lines. Unlike the existing techniques that are optimized for file-level defect prediction, Bugsplorer is optimized for a line-level defect prediction objective. Our evaluation with five performance metrics shows that Bugsplorer has a promising capability of predicting defective lines with 26-72% better accuracy than that of the state-of-the-art technique. It can rank the first 20% defective lines within the top 1-3% suspicious lines. Thus, Bugsplorer has the potential to significantly reduce SQA costs by ranking defective lines higher.

> \textit{Federated learning} (FL) and \textit{split learning} (SL) are prevailing distributed paradigms in recent years. They both enable shared global model training while keeping data localized on users' devices. The former excels in parallel execution capabilities, while the latter enjoys low dependence on edge computing resources and strong privacy protection. \textit{Split federated learning} (SFL) combines the strengths of both FL and SL, making it one of the most popular distributed architectures. Furthermore, a recent study has claimed that SFL exhibits robustness against poisoning attacks, with a fivefold improvement compared to FL in terms of robustness.   In this paper, we present a novel poisoning attack known as MISA. It poisons both the top and bottom models, causing a \textbf{\underline{misa}}lignment in the global model, ultimately leading to a drastic accuracy collapse. This attack unveils the vulnerabilities in SFL, challenging the conventional belief that SFL is robust against poisoning attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MISA poses a significant threat to the availability of SFL, underscoring the imperative for academia and industry to accord this matter due attention.

> There has been significant recent progress in training differentially private (DP) models which achieve accuracy that approaches the best non-private models. These DP models are typically pretrained on large public datasets and then fine-tuned on private downstream datasets that are relatively large and similar in distribution to the pretraining data. However, in many applications including personalization and federated learning, it is crucial to perform well (i) in the few-shot setting, as obtaining large amounts of labeled data may be problematic; and (ii) on datasets from a wide variety of domains for use in various specialist settings. To understand under which conditions few-shot DP can be effective, we perform an exhaustive set of experiments that reveals how the accuracy and vulnerability to attack of few-shot DP image classification models are affected as the number of shots per class, privacy level, model architecture, downstream dataset, and subset of learnable parameters in the model vary. We show that to achieve DP accuracy on par with non-private models, the shots per class must be increased as the privacy level increases. We also show that learning parameter-efficient FiLM adapters under DP is competitive with learning just the final classifier layer or learning all of the network parameters. Finally, we evaluate DP federated learning systems and establish state-of-the-art performance on the challenging FLAIR benchmark.

> Go is a modern programming language gaining popularity in enterprise microservice systems. Concurrency is a first-class citizen in Go with lightweight ``goroutines'' as the building blocks of concurrent execution. Go advocates message-passing to communicate and synchronize among goroutines. Improper use of message passing in Go can result in ``partial deadlocks'' , a subtle concurrency bug where a blocked sender (receiver) never finds a corresponding receiver (sender), causing the blocked goroutine to leak memory, via its call stack and objects reachable from the stack.   In this paper, we systematically study the prevalence of message passing and the resulting partial deadlocks in 75 million lines of Uber's Go monorepo hosting over 2500 microservices. We develop two lightweight, dynamic analysis tools: Goleak and LeakProf, designed to identify partial deadlocks. Goleak detects partial deadlocks during unit testing and prevents the introduction of new bugs. Conversely, LeakProf uses goroutine profiles obtained from services deployed in production to pinpoint intricate bugs arising from complex control flow, unexplored interleavings, or the absence of test coverage. We share our experience and insights deploying these tools in developer workflows in a large industrial setting. Using Goleak we unearthed 857 pre-existing goroutine leaks in the legacy code and prevented the introduction of around 260 new leaks over one year period. Using LeakProf we found 24 and fixed 21 goroutine leaks, which resulted in up to 34% speedup and 9.2x memory reduction in some of our production services.

> Fuzzing is a popular bug detection technique achieved by testing software executables with random inputs. This technique can also be extended to libraries by constructing executables that call library APIs, known as fuzz drivers. Automated fuzz driver synthesis has been an important research topic in recent years since it can facilitate the library fuzzing process. Nevertheless, existing approaches generally ignore generic APIs or simply treat them as normal APIs. As a result, they cannot generate effective fuzz drivers for generic APIs.   This paper studies the automated fuzz driver synthesis problem for Rust libraries with generic APIs. The problem is essential because Rust emphasizes security, and generic APIs are widely employed in Rust crates. Each generic API can have numerous monomorphic versions as long as the type constraints are satisfied. The critical challenge to this problem lies in prioritizing these monomorphic versions and providing valid inputs for them. To address the problem, we extend existing API-dependency graphs to support generic APIs. By solving such dependencies and type constraints, we can generate a collection of candidate monomorphic APIs. Further, we apply a similarity-based filter to prune redundant versions, particularly if multiple monomorphic APIs adopt the identical trait implementation. Experimental results with 29 popular open-source libraries show that our approach can achieve promising generic API coverage with a low rate of invalid fuzz drivers. Besides, we find 23 bugs previously unknown in these libraries, with 18 bugs related to generic APIs.

> Machine learning (ML) models trained on data from potentially untrusted sources are vulnerable to poisoning. A small, maliciously crafted subset of the training inputs can cause the model to learn a "backdoor" task (e.g., misclassify inputs with a certain feature) in addition to its main task. Recent research proposed many hypothetical backdoor attacks whose efficacy heavily depends on the configuration and training hyperparameters of the target model.   Given the variety of potential backdoor attacks, ML engineers who are not security experts have no way to measure how vulnerable their current training pipelines are, nor do they have a practical way to compare training configurations so as to pick the more resistant ones. Deploying a defense requires evaluating and choosing from among dozens of research papers and re-engineering the training pipeline.   In this paper, we aim to provide ML engineers with pragmatic tools to audit the backdoor resistance of their training pipelines and to compare different training configurations, to help choose one that best balances accuracy and security.   First, we propose a universal, attack-agnostic resistance metric based on the minimum number of training inputs that must be compromised before the model learns any backdoor.   Second, we design, implement, and evaluate Mithridates a multi-stage approach that integrates backdoor resistance into the training-configuration search. ML developers already rely on hyperparameter search to find configurations that maximize the model's accuracy. Mithridates extends this standard tool to balance accuracy and resistance without disruptive changes to the training pipeline. We show that hyperparameters found by Mithridates increase resistance to multiple types of backdoor attacks by 3-5x with only a slight impact on accuracy. We also discuss extensions to AutoML and federated learning.

> Gradient inversion attacks can leak data privacy when clients share weight updates with the server in federated learning (FL). Existing studies mainly use L2 or cosine distance as the loss function for gradient matching in the attack. Our empirical investigation shows that the vulnerability ranking varies with the loss function used. Gradient norm, which is commonly used as a vulnerability proxy for gradient inversion attack, cannot explain this as it remains constant regardless of the loss function for gradient matching. In this paper, we propose a loss-aware vulnerability proxy (LAVP) for the first time. LAVP refers to either the maximum or minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian with respect to gradient matching loss at ground truth. This suggestion is based on our theoretical findings regarding the local optimization of the gradient inversion in proximity to the ground truth, which corresponds to the worst case attack scenario. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAVP on various architectures and datasets, showing its consistent superiority over the gradient norm in capturing sample vulnerabilities. The performance of each proxy is measured in terms of Spearman's rank correlation with respect to several similarity scores. This work will contribute to enhancing FL security against any potential loss functions beyond L2 or cosine distance in the future.

> Contrastive vision-language representation learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification, by learning from millions of image-caption pairs crawled from the internet. However, the massive data that powers large multimodal models such as CLIP, makes them extremely vulnerable to various types of targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks. Despite this vulnerability, robust contrastive vision-language pre-training against such attacks has remained unaddressed. In this work, we propose ROCLIP, the first effective method for robust pre-training multimodal vision-language models against targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks. ROCLIP effectively breaks the association between poisoned image-caption pairs by considering a relatively large and varying pool of random captions, and matching every image with the text that is most similar to it in the pool instead of its own caption, every few epochs.It also leverages image and text augmentations to further strengthen the defense and improve the performance of the model. Our extensive experiments show that ROCLIP renders state-of-the-art targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks ineffective during pre-training CLIP models. In particular, ROCLIP decreases the success rate for targeted data poisoning attacks from 93.75% to 12.5% and that of backdoor attacks down to 0%, while improving the model's linear probe performance by 10% and maintains a similar zero shot performance compared to CLIP. By increasing the frequency of matching, ROCLIP is able to defend strong attacks, which add up to 1% poisoned examples to the data, and successfully maintain a low attack success rate of 12.5%, while trading off the performance on some tasks.

> Cross-chain bridges are used to facilitate token and data exchanges across blockchains. Although bridges are becoming increasingly popular, they are still in their infancy and have been attacked multiple times recently, causing significant financial loss. Although there are numerous reports online explaining each of the incidents on cross-chain bridges, they are scattered over the Internet, and there is no work that analyzes the security landscape of cross-chain bridges in a holistic manner. To fill the gap, in this paper, we performed a systematic study of cross-chain bridge security issues. First, we summarize the characteristics of existing cross-chain bridges, including their usages, verification mechanisms, communication models, and three categorizations. Based on these characteristics, we identify 12 potential attack vectors that attackers may exploit. Next, we introduce a taxonomy that categorizes cross-chain attacks in the past two years into 10 distinct types, and then provide explanations for each vulnerability type, accompanied by Solidity code examples. We also discuss existing and potential defenses, as well as open questions and future research directions on cross-chain bridges. We believe that this systematization can shed light on designing and implementing cross-chain bridges with higher security and, more importantly, facilitating future research on building a better cross-chain bridge ecosystem.

> While Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) has gained attention, its algorithmic robustness against adversarial perturbations remains unexplored. The attacks and robust representation training methods that are designed for traditional RL become less effective when applied to GCRL. To address this challenge, we first propose the Semi-Contrastive Representation attack, a novel approach inspired by the adversarial contrastive attack. Unlike existing attacks in RL, it only necessitates information from the policy function and can be seamlessly implemented during deployment. Then, to mitigate the vulnerability of existing GCRL algorithms, we introduce Adversarial Representation Tactics, which combines Semi-Contrastive Adversarial Augmentation with Sensitivity-Aware Regularizer to improve the adversarial robustness of the underlying RL agent against various types of perturbations. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our attack and defence methods across multiple state-of-the-art GCRL algorithms. Our tool ReRoGCRL is available at https://github.com/TrustAI/ReRoGCRL.

> We describe a method for verifying the output of a deep neural network for medical image segmentation that is robust to several classes of random as well as worst-case perturbations i.e. adversarial attacks. This method is based on a general approach recently developed by the authors called "Trust, but Verify" wherein an auxiliary verification network produces predictions about certain masked features in the input image using the segmentation as an input. A well-designed auxiliary network will produce high-quality predictions when the input segmentations are accurate, but will produce low-quality predictions when the segmentations are incorrect. Checking the predictions of such a network with the original image allows us to detect bad segmentations. However, to ensure the verification method is truly robust, we need a method for checking the quality of the predictions that does not itself rely on a black-box neural network. Indeed, we show that previous methods for segmentation evaluation that do use deep neural regression networks are vulnerable to false negatives i.e. can inaccurately label bad segmentations as good. We describe the design of a verification network that avoids such vulnerability and present results to demonstrate its robustness compared to previous methods.

> In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of MDE to adversarial patches. We propose a novel \underline{S}tealthy \underline{A}dversarial \underline{A}ttacks on \underline{M}DE (SAAM) that compromises MDE by either corrupting the estimated distance or causing an object to seamlessly blend into its surroundings. Our experiments, demonstrate that the designed stealthy patch successfully causes a DNN-based MDE to misestimate the depth of objects. In fact, our proposed adversarial patch achieves a significant 60\% depth error with 99\% ratio of the affected region. Importantly, despite its adversarial nature, the patch maintains a naturalistic appearance, making it inconspicuous to human observers. We believe that this work sheds light on the threat of adversarial attacks in the context of MDE on edge devices. We hope it raises awareness within the community about the potential real-life harm of such attacks and encourages further research into developing more robust and adaptive defense mechanisms.

> The popularity of the Java programming language has led to its wide adoption in cloud computing infrastructures. However, Java applications running in untrusted clouds are vulnerable to various forms of privileged attacks. The emergence of trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX mitigates this problem. TEEs protect code and data in secure enclaves inaccessible to untrusted software, including the kernel and hypervisors. To efficiently use TEEs, developers must manually partition their applications into trusted and untrusted parts, in order to reduce the size of the trusted computing base (TCB) and minimise the risks of security vulnerabilities. However, partitioning applications poses two important challenges: (i) ensuring efficient object communication between the partitioned components, and (ii) ensuring the consistency of garbage collection between the parts, especially with memory-managed languages such as Java. We present Montsalvat, a tool which provides a practical and intuitive annotation-based partitioning approach for Java applications destined for secure enclaves. Montsalvat provides an RMI-like mechanism to ensure inter-object communication, as well as consistent garbage collection across the partitioned components. We implement Montsalvat with GraalVM native-image, a tool for compiling Java applications ahead-of-time into standalone native executables that do not require a JVM at runtime. Our extensive evaluation with micro- and macro-benchmarks shows our partitioning approach to boost performance in real-world applications

In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning by proposing a novel generative model for creating effective adversarial examples to attack the agent. Our proposed model can achieve both targeted attacks and untargeted attacks. Considering the specificity of deep reinforcement learning, we propose the action consistency ratio as a measure of stealthiness, and a new measurement index of effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiment results show that our method can ensure the effectiveness and stealthiness of attack compared with other algorithms. Moreover, our methods are considerably faster and thus can achieve rapid and efficient verification of the vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning.

> Detecting SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks is crucial for web-based data center security, but it is challenging to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in high-speed networks. Traditional methods struggle with this balance, while NLP-based approaches, although accurate, are computationally intensive.   We introduce a novel cascade SQLi detection method, blending classical and transformer-based NLP models, achieving a 99.86% detection accuracy with significantly lower computational demands-20 times faster than using transformer-based models alone. Our approach is tested in a realistic setting and compared with 35 other methods, including Machine Learning-based and transformer models like BERT, on a dataset of over 30,000 SQL sentences.   Our results show that this hybrid method effectively detects SQLi in high-traffic environments, offering efficient and accurate protection against SQLi vulnerabilities with computational efficiency.

> The hardware security community has made significant advances in detecting Hardware Trojan vulnerabilities using software fuzzing-inspired automated analysis. However, the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) code base itself remains under-examined by the same techniques. Our experiments in fuzzing EDA tools demonstrate that, indeed, they are prone to software bugs. As a consequence, this paper unveils HeisenTrojan attacks, a new hardware attack that does not generate harmful hardware, but rather, exploits software vulnerabilities in the EDA tools themselves. A key feature of HeisenTrojan attacks is that they are capable of deploying a malicious payload on the system hosting the EDA tools without triggering verification tools because HeisenTrojan attacks do not rely on superfluous or malicious hardware that would otherwise be noticeable. The aim of a HeisenTrojan attack is to execute arbitrary code on the system on which the vulnerable EDA tool is hosted, thereby establishing a permanent presence and providing a beachhead for intrusion into that system. Our analysis reveals 83% of the EDA tools analyzed have exploitable bugs. In what follows, we demonstrate an end- to-end attack and provide analysis on the existing capabilities of fuzzers to find HeisenTrojan attacks in order to emphasize their practicality and the need to secure EDA tools against them.

> The abundance of cyber-physical components in modern day power grid with their diverse hardware and software vulnerabilities has made it difficult to protect them from advanced persistent threats (APTs). An attack graph depicting the propagation of potential cyber-attack sequences from the initial access point to the end objective is vital to identify critical weaknesses of any cyber-physical system. A cyber security personnel can accordingly plan preventive mitigation measures for the identified weaknesses addressing the cyber-attack sequences. However, limitations on available cybersecurity budget restrict the choice of mitigation measures. We address this aspect through our framework, which solves the following problem: given potential cyber-attack sequences for a cyber-physical component in the power grid, find the optimal manner to allocate an available budget to implement necessary preventive mitigation measures. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to identify the optimal budget partition and set of mitigation measures which minimize the vulnerability of cyber-physical components to potential attack sequences. We assume that the allocation of budget affects the efficacy of the mitigation measures. We show how altering the budget allocation for tasks such as asset management, cybersecurity infrastructure improvement, incident response planning and employee training affects the choice of the optimal set of preventive mitigation measures and modifies the associated cybersecurity risk. The proposed framework can be used by cyber policymakers and system owners to allocate optimal budgets for various tasks required to improve the overall security of a cyber-physical system.

Despite the fact that the stature of NVD is one of the most significant databases for the latest insights into vulnerabilities, extracting meaningful trends from such a large amount of unstructured data is still challenging without the application of suitable technological methodologies. Previous efforts have mostly concentrated on software vulnerabilities; however, a holistic strategy incorporates approaches for mitigating vulnerabilities, score prediction, and a knowledge-generating system that may extract relevant insights from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerability Exchange (CVE) databases is notably absent. As the number of hardware attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices continues to rapidly increase, we present the Hardware Vulnerability to Weakness Mapping (HW-V2W-Map) Framework, which is a Machine Learning (ML) framework focusing on hardware vulnerabilities and IoT security. The architecture that we have proposed incorporates an Ontology-driven Storytelling framework, which automates the process of updating the ontology in order to recognize patterns and evolution of vulnerabilities over time and provides approaches for mitigating the vulnerabilities. The repercussions of vulnerabilities can be mitigated as a result of this, and conversely, future exposures can be predicted and prevented. Furthermore, our proposed framework utilized Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide mitigation suggestions.

- `2306.11758v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11758v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11758v2)

> To ensure resilient neural network processing on even unreliable hardware, comprehensive reliability analysis against various hardware faults is generally required before the deep neural network models are deployed, and efficient error injection tools are highly demanded. However, most existing fault injection tools remain rather limited to basic fault injection to neurons and fail to provide fine-grained vulnerability analysis capability. In addition, many of the fault injection tools still need to change the neural network models and make the fault injection closely coupled with normal neural network processing, which further complicates the use of the fault injection tools and slows down the fault simulation. In this work, we propose MRFI, a highly configurable multi-resolution fault injection tool for deep neural networks. It enables users to modify an independent fault configuration file rather than neural network models for the fault injection and vulnerability analysis. Particularly, it integrates extensive fault analysis functionalities from different perspectives and enables multi-resolution investigation of the vulnerability of neural networks. In addition, it does not modify the major neural network computing framework of PyTorch. Hence, it allows parallel processing on GPUs naturally and exhibits fast fault simulation according to our experiments.

> The power grid is a critical infrastructure that plays a vital role in modern society. Its availability is of utmost importance, as a loss can endanger human lives. However, with the increasing digitalization of the power grid, it also becomes vulnerable to new cyberattacks that can compromise its availability. To counter these threats, intrusion detection systems are developed and deployed to detect cyberattacks targeting the power grid. Among intrusion detection systems, anomaly detection models based on machine learning have shown potential in detecting unknown attack vectors. However, the scarcity of data for training these models remains a challenge due to confidentiality concerns. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a model for generating synthetic data of multi-stage cyber attacks in the power grid, using attack trees to model the attacker's sequence of steps and a game-theoretic approach to incorporate the defender's actions. This model aims to create diverse attack data on which machine learning algorithms can be trained.

> Fault-tolerant deep learning accelerator is the basis for highly reliable deep learning processing and critical to deploy deep learning in safety-critical applications such as avionics and robotics. Since deep learning is known to be computing- and memory-intensive, traditional fault-tolerant approaches based on redundant computing will incur substantial overhead including power consumption and chip area. To this end, we propose to characterize deep learning vulnerability difference across both neurons and bits of each neuron, and leverage the vulnerability difference to enable selective protection of the deep learning processing components from the perspective of architecture layer and circuit layer respectively. At the same time, we observe the correlation between model quantization and bit protection overhead of the underlying processing elements of deep learning accelerators, and propose to reduce the bit protection overhead by adding additional quantization constrain without compromising the model accuracy. Finally, we employ Bayesian optimization strategy to co-optimize the correlated cross-layer design parameters at algorithm layer, architecture layer, and circuit layer to minimize the hardware resource consumption while fulfilling multiple user constraints including reliability, accuracy, and performance of the deep learning processing at the same time.

> This paper describes the dialog robot system designed by Team Irisapu for the preliminary round of the Dialogue Robot Competition 2023 (DRC2023). In order to generate dialogue responses flexibly while adhering to predetermined scenarios, we attempted to generate dialogue response sentences using OpenAI's GPT-3. We aimed to create a system that can appropriately respond to users by dividing the dialogue scenario into five sub-scenarios, and creating prompts for each sub-scenario. Also, we incorporated a recovery strategy that can handle dialogue breakdowns flexibly. Our research group has been working on research related to dialogue breakdown detection, and we incorporated our findings to date in this competition. As a result of the preliminary round, a bug in our system affected the outcome and we were not able to achieve a satisfactory result. However, in the evaluation category of "reliability of provided information", we ranked third among all teams.

> Invasive signal crayfish have a detrimental impact on ecosystems. They spread the fungal-type crayfish plague disease (Aphanomyces astaci) that is lethal to the native white clawed crayfish, the only native crayfish species in Britain. Invasive signal crayfish extensively burrow, causing habitat destruction, erosion of river banks and adverse changes in water quality, while also competing with native species for resources and leading to declines in native populations. Moreover, pollution exacerbates the vulnerability of White-clawed crayfish, with their populations declining by over 90% in certain English counties, making them highly susceptible to extinction. To safeguard aquatic ecosystems, it is imperative to address the challenges posed by invasive species and discarded plastics in the United Kingdom's river ecosystem's. The UDEEP platform can play a crucial role in environmental monitoring by performing on-the-fly classification of Signal crayfish and plastic debris while leveraging the efficacy of AI, IoT devices and the power of edge computing (i.e., NJN). By providing accurate data on the presence, spread and abundance of these species, the UDEEP platform can contribute to monitoring efforts and aid in mitigating the spread of invasive species.

> As technology continues to advance and we usher in the era of Industry 5.0, there has been a profound paradigm shift in operating systems, file systems, web, and network applications. The conventional utilization of multiprocessing and multicore systems has made concurrent programming increasingly pervasive. However, this transformation has brought about a new set of issues known as concurrency bugs, which, due to their wide prevalence in concurrent programs, have led to severe failures and potential security exploits. Over the past two decades, numerous researchers have dedicated their efforts to unveiling, detecting, mitigating, and preventing these bugs, with the last decade witnessing a surge in research within this domain. Among the spectrum of concurrency bugs, data races or race condition vulnerabilities stand out as the most prevalent, accounting for a staggering 80\% of all concurrency bugs. This survey paper is focused on the realm of race condition bug detectors. We systematically categorize these detectors based on the diverse methodologies they employ. Additionally, we delve into the techniques and algorithms associated with race detection, tracing the evolution of this field over time. Furthermore, we shed light on the application of fuzzing techniques in the detection of race condition vulnerabilities. By reviewing these detectors and their static analyses, we draw conclusions and outline potential future research directions, including enhancing accuracy, performance, applicability, and comprehensiveness in race condition vulnerability detection.

> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in Metaverse environments to generate dynamic and realistic content and to control the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs). However, the cybersecurity concerns associated with LLMs have become increasingly prominent. Previous research has primarily focused on patching system vulnerabilities to enhance cybersecurity, but these approaches are not well-suited to the Metaverse, where the virtual space is more complex, LLMs are vulnerable, and ethical user interaction is critical. Moreover, the scope of cybersecurity in the Metaverse is expected to expand significantly. This paper proposes a method for enhancing cybersecurity through the simulation of user interaction with LLMs. Our goal is to educate users and strengthen their defense capabilities through exposure to a comprehensive simulation system. This system includes extensive Metaverse cybersecurity Q&A and attack simulation scenarios. By engaging with these, users will improve their ability to recognize and withstand risks. Additionally, to address the ethical implications of user input, we propose using LLMs as evaluators to assess user content across five dimensions. We further adapt the models through vocabulary expansion training to better understand personalized inputs and emoticons. We conduct experiments on multiple LLMs and find that our approach is effective.

> Virtual assistants (VAs) have seen increased use in recent years due to their ease of use for daily tasks. Despite their growing prevalence, their security and privacy implications are still not well understood. To address this gap, we conducted a study to evaluate the security and privacy postures of eight widely used voice assistants: Alexa, Braina, Cortana, Google Assistant, Kalliope, Mycroft, Hound, and Extreme. We used three vulnerability testing tools, AndroBugs, RiskInDroid, and MobSF, to assess the security and privacy of these VAs. Our analysis focused on five areas: code, access control, tracking, binary analysis, and sensitive data confidentiality. The results revealed that these VAs are vulnerable to a range of security threats, including not validating SSL certificates, executing raw SQL queries, and using a weak mode of the AES algorithm. These vulnerabilities could allow malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to users' personal information. This study is a first step toward understanding the risks associated with these technologies and provides a foundation for future research to develop more secure and privacy-respecting VAs.

> As software becomes increasingly complex and prone to vulnerabilities, automated vulnerability detection is critically important, yet challenging. Given the significant successes of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks, there is growing anticipation of their efficacy in vulnerability detection. However, a quantitative understanding of their potential in vulnerability detection is still missing. To bridge this gap, we introduce a comprehensive vulnerability benchmark VulBench. This benchmark aggregates high-quality data from a wide range of CTF (Capture-the-Flag) challenges and real-world applications, with annotations for each vulnerable function detailing the vulnerability type and its root cause. Through our experiments encompassing 16 LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based models and static analyzers, we find that several LLMs outperform traditional deep learning approaches in vulnerability detection, revealing an untapped potential in LLMs. This work contributes to the understanding and utilization of LLMs for enhanced software security.

> The quality of a software is highly dependent on the quality of the tests it is submitted to. Writing tests for bug detection is thus essential. However, it is time-consuming when done manually. Automating test cases generation has therefore been an exciting research area in the software engineering community. Most approaches have been focused on generating unit tests. Unfortunately, current efforts often do not lead to the generation of relevant inputs, which limits the efficiency of automatically generated tests. Towards improving the relevance of test inputs, we present \name, a technique for exploring bug reports to identify input values that can be fed to automatic test generation tools. In this work, we investigate the performance of using inputs extracted from bug reports with \name to generate test cases with Evosuite. The evaluation is performed on the Defects4J benchmark. For Defects4J projects, our study has shown that \name successfully extracted 68.68\% of relevant inputs when using regular expression in its approach versus 50.21\% relevant inputs without regular expression. Further, our study has shown the potential to improve the Line and Instruction Coverage across all projects. Overall, we successfully collected relevant inputs that led to the detection of 45 bugs that were previously undetected by the baseline.

> The year 2022 saw a significant increase in Microsoft vulnerabilities, reaching an all-time high in the past decade. With new vulnerabilities constantly emerging, there is an urgent need for proactive approaches to harden systems and protect them from potential cyber threats. This project aims to investigate the vulnerabilities of the Windows Operating System and explore the effectiveness of key security features such as BitLocker, Microsoft Defender, and Windows Firewall in addressing these threats. To achieve this, various security threats are simulated in controlled environments using coded examples, allowing for a thorough evaluation of the security solutions' effectiveness. Based on the results, this study will provide recommendations for mitigation strategies to enhance system security and strengthen the protection provided by Windows security features. By identifying potential weaknesses and areas of improvement in the Windows security infrastructure, this project will contribute to the development of more robust and resilient security solutions that can better safeguard systems against emerging cyber threats.

> As 5G networks become more mainstream, privacy has come to the forefront of end users. More scrutiny has been shown to previous generation cellular technologies such as 3G and 4G on how they handle sensitive metadata transmitted from an end user mobile device to base stations during registration with a cellular network. These generation cellular networks do not enforce any encryption on this information transmitted during this process, giving malicious actors an easy way to intercept the information. Such an interception can allow an adversary to locate end users with shocking accuracy. This paper investigates this problem in great detail and discusses how a newly introduced approach in 5G networks is helping combat this problem. The paper discusses the implications of this vulnerability and the technical details of the new approach, including the encryption schemes used to secure this sensitive information. Finally, the paper will discuss any limitations to this new approach.

> Recommender systems can be privacy-sensitive. To protect users' private historical interactions, federated learning has been proposed in distributed learning for user representations. Using federated recommender (FedRec) systems, users can train a shared recommendation model on local devices and prevent raw data transmissions and collections. However, the recommendation model learned by a common FedRec may still be vulnerable to private information leakage risks, particularly attribute inference attacks, which means that the attacker can easily infer users' personal attributes from the learned model. Additionally, traditional FedRecs seldom consider the diverse privacy preference of users, leading to difficulties in balancing the recommendation utility and privacy preservation. Consequently, FedRecs may suffer from unnecessary recommendation performance loss due to over-protection and private information leakage simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel user-consented federated recommendation system (UC-FedRec) to flexibly satisfy the different privacy needs of users by paying a minimum recommendation accuracy price. UC-FedRec allows users to self-define their privacy preferences to meet various demands and makes recommendations with user consent. Experiments conducted on different real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework is more efficient and flexible compared to baselines.

Thus, authentication is an important aspect for establishing a secure communication between various participants. In this paper, we study the two recent authentication and key exchange protocols. We prove that these protocols are vulnerable to replay attack and modification attack, and also suffer from technical correctness. We then present the possible improvements to overcome the discussed vulnerabilities. The enhancement preserves performance of the original protocols.

> Use of figurative language, such as metaphors and idioms, is common in our daily-life communications, and it can also be found in Software Engineering (SE) channels, such as comments on GitHub. Automatically interpreting figurative language is a challenging task, even with modern Large Language Models (LLMs), as it often involves subtle nuances. This is particularly true in the SE domain, where figurative language is frequently used to convey technical concepts, often bearing developer affect (e.g., `spaghetti code'). Surprisingly, there is a lack of studies on how figurative language in SE communications impacts the performance of automatic tools that focus on understanding developer communications, e.g., bug prioritization, incivility detection. Furthermore, it is an open question to what extent state-of-the-art LLMs interpret figurative expressions in domain-specific communication such as software engineering. To address this gap, we study the prevalence and impact of figurative language in SE communication channels. This study contributes to understanding the role of figurative language in SE, the potential of LLMs in interpreting them, and its impact on automated SE communication analysis. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs with figurative language in SE and its potential impact on automated tasks that involve affect. We found that, among three state-of-the-art LLMs, the best improved fine-tuned versions have an average improvement of 6.66% on a GitHub emotion classification dataset, 7.07% on a GitHub incivility classification dataset, and 3.71% on a Bugzilla bug report prioritization dataset.

> Bug reports document unexpected behaviors in software, enabling developers to understand, validate, and fix bugs. Unfortunately, a significant portion of bug reports is of low quality, which poses challenges for developers in terms of addressing these issues. Prior research has delved into the information needed for documenting high-quality bug reports and expediting bug report management. Furthermore, researchers have explored the challenges associated with bug report management and proposed various automated techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques exhibit several limitations, including a lexical gap between developers and reporters, difficulties in bug reproduction, and identifying bug locations. Therefore, there is a pressing need for additional efforts to effectively manage bug reports and enhance the quality of both desktop and mobile applications. In this paper, we describe the existing limitations of bug reports and identify potential strategies for addressing them. Our vision encompasses a future where the alleviation of these limitations and successful execution of our proposed new research directions can benefit both reporters and developers, ultimately making the entire software maintenance faster.

> Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) are gradually integrating information technology and automating industrial processes, leading systems to become more vulnerable to malicious actors. Thus, to deploy secure Industrial Control and Production Systems (ICPS) in smart factories, cyber threats and risks must be addressed. To identify all possible threats, Threat Modeling is a promising solution. Despite the existence of numerous methodological solutions for threat modeling in cyber-physical systems (CPS), current approaches are ad hoc and inefficient in providing clear insights to researchers and organizations involved in IIoT technologies. These approaches lack a comprehensive analysis of cyber threats and fail to facilitate effective path analysis across the ICPS lifecycle, incorporating smart manufacturing technologies and tools. To address these gaps, a novel quantitative threat modeling approach is proposed, aiming to identify probable attack vectors, assess the path of attacks, and evaluate the magnitude of each vector. This paper also explains the execution of the proposed approach with two case studies, namely the industrial manufacturing line, i.e., the Internet of Manufacturing (IoM), and the power and industry, i.e., the Internet of Production (IoP).

> [Context]: Containerization ensures the resilience of distributed applications by Kubernetes. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes applications. A Helm package, namely "Chart'', is a set of pre-configured resources that one could quickly deploy a complex application. However, Helm broadens the attack surface of the distributed applications.   [Objective]: This study aims to investigate the prevalence of fixable vulnerabilities, the factors related to the vulnerabilities, and current mitigation strategies in Helm Charts.   [Method]: We conduct a mixed-methods study on 11,035 Helm Charts affected by 10,982 fixable vulnerabilities. We analyze the complexity of Charts and compare the distribution of vulnerabilities between official and unofficial Charts. Subsequently, we investigate vulnerability mitigation strategies from the Chart-associated repositories by a grounded theory.   [Results]: Our findings highlight that the complexity of a Chart correlates with the number of vulnerabilities, and the official Charts do not contain fewer vulnerabilities compared to unofficial Charts. The 10,982 fixable vulnerabilities are at a median of high severity and can be easily exploited. In addition, we identify 11 vulnerability mitigation strategies in three categories. Due to the complexity of Charts, maintainers are required to investigate where a vulnerability impacts and how to mitigate it. The use of automated strategies is low as automation has limited capability(e.g., a higher number of false positives) in such complex Charts.   [Conclusion]: There exists need for automation tools that assist maintainers in mitigating vulnerabilities to reduce manual effort. In addition, Chart maintainers lack incentives to mitigate vulnerabilities, given a lack of guidelines for mitigation responsibilities. Adopting a shared responsibility model in the Helm ecosystem would increase its security.

> The security of smart contracts, which are an important part of blockchain technology, has attracted much attention. In particular, reentrancy vulnerability, which is hidden and complex, poses a great threat to smart contracts. In order to improve the existing detection methods, which exhibit low efficiency and accuracy, in this paper, we propose a smart contract threat detection technology based on symbolic execution. In this method, first, the recursive descent algorithm is used to recover the basic blocks of contract code and control flow diagram, and static type inference is performed for static single assignment (SSA) variables. Then, the control flow diagram is encoded into constrained horn clause (CHC) constraints in combination with the symbolic execution technology. Model checking is conducted for the generated constraints using an automatic theorem prover based on the abstraction refinement technique for fast static detection of common security threats in smart contracts. Compared with existing detection methods, the method proposed in this paper allows the detection of both the checks-effects-interactions pattern and the vulnerability in relation to reentrant locks. It can simulate the state changes of reentrant locks as well as other global variables in multiple recursive transactions. The experimental results show that this method significantly increases both detection efficiency and accuracy, improving the security of smart contracts.

> Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop techniques aimed at improving the reliability, effectiveness, and overall quality of software systems. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been successfully used for automation in complex tasks such as game testing and solving the job-shop scheduling problem. However, these specialized DRL agents, trained from scratch on specific tasks, suffer from a lack of generalizability to other tasks and they need substantial time to be developed and re-trained effectively. Recently, DRL researchers have begun to develop generalist agents, able to learn a policy from various environments and capable of achieving performances similar to or better than specialist agents in new tasks. In the Natural Language Processing or Computer Vision domain, these generalist agents are showing promising adaptation capabilities to never-before-seen tasks after a light fine-tuning phase and achieving high performance. This paper investigates the potential of generalist agents for solving SE tasks. Specifically, we conduct an empirical study aimed at assessing the performance of two generalist agents on two important SE tasks: the detection of bugs in games (for two games) and the minimization of makespan in a scheduling task, to solve the job-shop scheduling problem (for two instances). Our results show that the generalist agents outperform the specialist agents with very little effort for fine-tuning, achieving a 20% reduction of the makespan over specialized agent performance on task-based scheduling. In the context of game testing, some generalist agent configurations detect 85% more bugs than the specialist agents. Building on our analysis, we provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners looking to select generalist agents for SE tasks, to ensure that they perform effectively.

- *Nima Shiri Harzevili, Mohammad Mahdi Mohajer, Moshi Wei, Hung Viet Pham, Song Wang*

- `2306.03269v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03269v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03269v2)

> Recently, many Deep Learning fuzzers have been proposed for testing of DL libraries. However, they either perform unguided input generation (e.g., not considering the relationship between API arguments when generating inputs) or only support a limited set of corner case test inputs. Furthermore, a substantial number of developer APIs crucial for library development remain untested, as they are typically not well-documented and lack clear usage guidelines.   To fill this gap, we propose a novel fuzzer named Orion, which combines guided test input generation and corner case test input generation based on a set of fuzzing rules constructed from historical data that is known to trigger vulnerabilities in the implementation of DL APIs. To extract the fuzzing rules, we first conduct an empirical study regarding the root cause analysis of 376 vulnerabilities in two of the most popular DL libraries, i.e., PyTorch and TensorFlow. We then construct the rules based on the root causes of the historical vulnerabilities.   Our evaluation shows that Orion reports 135 vulnerabilities on the latest releases of TensorFlow and PyTorch, 76 of which were confirmed by the library developers. Among the 76 confirmed vulnerabilities, 69 are previously unknown, and 7 have already been fixed. The rest are awaiting further confirmation. Regarding end-user APIs, Orion was able to detect 31.8% and 90% more vulnerabilities on TensorFlow and PyTorch, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art conventional fuzzer, i.e., DeepRel. When compared to the state-of-the-art LLM-based DL fuzzer, AtlasFuzz, Orion detected 13.63% more vulnerabilities on TensorFlow and 18.42% more vulnerabilities on PyTorch. Regarding developer APIs, Orion stands out by detecting 117% more vulnerabilities on TensorFlow and 100% more vulnerabilities on PyTorch compared to the most relevant fuzzer designed for developer APIs, such as FreeFuzz.

> Machine learning (ML) sees an increasing prevalence of being used in the internet-of-things (IoT)-based smart grid. However, the trustworthiness of ML is a severe issue that must be addressed to accommodate the trend of ML-based smart grid applications (MLsgAPPs). The adversarial distortion injected into the power signal will greatly affect the system's normal control and operation. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct vulnerability assessment for MLsgAPPs applied in the context of safety-critical power systems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in designing attack and defense methods for MLsgAPPs. Unlike the traditional survey about ML security, this is the first review work about the security of MLsgAPPs that focuses on the characteristics of power systems. We first highlight the specifics for constructing the adversarial attacks on MLsgAPPs. Then, the vulnerability of MLsgAPP is analyzed from both the aspects of the power system and ML model. Afterward, a comprehensive survey is conducted to review and compare existing studies about the adversarial attacks on MLsgAPPs in scenarios of generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption, and the countermeasures are reviewed according to the attacks that they defend against. Finally, the future research directions are discussed on the attacker's and defender's side, respectively. We also analyze the potential vulnerability of large language model-based (e.g., ChatGPT) power system applications. Overall, we encourage more researchers to contribute to investigating the adversarial issues of MLsgAPPs.

> Recent studies have pointed out that natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A backdoored model produces normal outputs on the clean samples while performing improperly on the texts with triggers that the adversary injects. However, previous studies on textual backdoor attack pay little attention to stealthiness. Moreover, some attack methods even cause grammatical issues or change the semantic meaning of the original texts. Therefore, they can easily be detected by humans or defense systems. In this paper, we propose a novel stealthy backdoor attack method against textual models, which is called \textbf{PuncAttack}. It leverages combinations of punctuation marks as the trigger and chooses proper locations strategically to replace them. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively compromise multiple models in various tasks. Meanwhile, we conduct automatic evaluation and human inspection, which indicate the proposed method possesses good performance of stealthiness without bringing grammatical issues and altering the meaning of sentences.

> Recently proposed BERT-based evaluation metrics for text generation perform well on standard benchmarks but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, e.g., relating to information correctness. We argue that this stems (in part) from the fact that they are models of semantic similarity. In contrast, we develop evaluation metrics based on Natural Language Inference (NLI), which we deem a more appropriate modeling. We design a preference-based adversarial attack framework and show that our NLI based metrics are much more robust to the attacks than the recent BERT-based metrics. On standard benchmarks, our NLI based metrics outperform existing summarization metrics, but perform below SOTA MT metrics. However, when combining existing metrics with our NLI metrics, we obtain both higher adversarial robustness (15%-30%) and higher quality metrics as measured on standard benchmarks (+5% to 30%).

> Redundancy-based automated program repair (APR), which generates patches by referencing existing source code, has gained much attention since they are effective in repairing real-world bugs with good interpretability. However, since existing approaches either demand the existence of multi-line similar code or randomly reference existing code, they can only repair a small number of bugs with many incorrect patches, hindering their wide application in practice. In this work, we aim to improve the effectiveness of redundancy-based APR by exploring more effective source code reuse methods for improving the number of correct patches and reducing incorrect patches. Specifically, we have proposed a new repair technique named Repatt, which incorporates a two-level pattern mining process for guiding effective patch generation (i.e., token and expression levels). We have conducted an extensive experiment on the widely-used Defects4J benchmark and compared Repatt with eight state-of-the-art APR approaches. The results show that our approach complements existing approaches by repairing {15} unique bugs compared with the latest deep learning-based methods and {19} unique bugs compared with traditional repair methods when providing the perfect fault localization. In addition, when the perfect fault localization is unknown in real practice, Repatt significantly outperforms the baseline approaches by achieving much higher patch precision, i.e., {83.8\%}. Moreover, we further proposed an effective patch ranking strategy for combining the strength of Repatt and the baseline methods. The result shows that it repairs 124 bugs when only considering the Top-1 patches and improves the best-performing repair method by repairing 39 more bugs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for practical use.

> Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of recommender systems to data privacy attacks. However, research on the threat to model privacy in recommender systems, such as model stealing attacks, is still in its infancy. Some adversarial attacks have achieved model stealing attacks against recommender systems, to some extent, by collecting abundant training data of the target model (target data) or making a mass of queries. In this paper, we constrain the volume of available target data and queries and utilize auxiliary data, which shares the item set with the target data, to promote model stealing attacks. Although the target model treats target and auxiliary data differently, their similar behavior patterns allow them to be fused using an attention mechanism to assist attacks. Besides, we design stealing functions to effectively extract the recommendation list obtained by querying the target model. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are applicable to most recommender systems and various scenarios and exhibit excellent attack performance on multiple datasets.

> Function-level binary code similarity detection is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity. It enables the detection of bugs and patent infringements in released software and plays a pivotal role in preventing supply chain attacks. A practical embedding learning framework relies on the robustness of the assembly code representation and the accuracy of function-pair annotation, which is traditionally accomplished using supervised learning-based frameworks. However, annotating different function pairs with accurate labels poses considerable challenges. These supervised learning methods can be easily overtrained and suffer from representation robustness problems. To address these challenges, we propose SimCLF: A Simple Contrastive Learning Framework for Function-level Binary Embeddings. We take an unsupervised learning approach and formulate binary code similarity detection as instance discrimination. SimCLF directly operates on disassembled binary functions and could be implemented with any encoder. It does not require manually annotated information but only augmented data. Augmented data is generated using compiler optimization options and code obfuscation techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that SimCLF surpasses the state-of-the-art in accuracy and has a significant advantage in few-shot settings.

> Graph convolution networks (GCNs) are extensively utilized in various graph tasks to mine knowledge from spatial data. Our study marks the pioneering attempt to quantitatively investigate the GCN robustness over omnipresent heterophilic graphs for node classification. We uncover that the predominant vulnerability is caused by the structural out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. This finding motivates us to present a novel method that aims to harden GCNs by automatically learning Latent Homophilic Structures over heterophilic graphs. We term such a methodology as LHS. To elaborate, our initial step involves learning a latent structure by employing a novel self-expressive technique based on multi-node interactions. Subsequently, the structure is refined using a pairwisely constrained dual-view contrastive learning approach. We iteratively perform the above procedure, enabling a GCN model to aggregate information in a homophilic way on heterophilic graphs. Armed with such an adaptable structure, we can properly mitigate the structural OOD threats over heterophilic graphs. Experiments on various benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed LHS approach for robust GCNs.

> Ethereum smart contracts, which are autonomous decentralized applications on the blockchain that manage assets often exceeding millions of dollars, have become primary targets for cyberattacks. In 2023 alone, such vulnerabilities led to substantial financial losses exceeding a billion of US dollars. To counter these threats, various tools have been developed by academic and commercial entities to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our study investigates the gap between the effectiveness of existing security scanners and the vulnerabilities that still persist in practice. We compiled four distinct datasets for this analysis. The first dataset comprises 77,219 source codes extracted directly from the blockchain, while the second includes over 4 million bytecodes obtained from Ethereum Mainnet and testnets. The other two datasets consist of nearly 14,000 manually annotated smart contracts and 373 smart contracts verified through audits, providing a foundation for a rigorous ground truth analysis on bytecode and source code. Using the unlabeled datasets, we conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 17 vulnerability scanners, revealing considerable discrepancies in their findings. Our analysis of the ground truth datasets indicated poor performance across all the tools we tested. This study unveils the reasons for poor performance and underscores that the current state of the art for smart contract security falls short in effectively addressing open problems, highlighting that the challenge of effectively detecting vulnerabilities remains a significant and unresolved issue.

> Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) are widely employed to model user behavior over time. However, their robustness in the face of perturbations in training data remains a largely understudied yet critical issue. A fundamental challenge emerges in previous studies aimed at assessing the robustness of SRSs: the Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) similarity is not particularly suited for this task as it is designed for infinite rankings of items and thus shows limitations in real-world scenarios. For instance, it fails to achieve a perfect score of 1 for two identical finite-length rankings. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel contribution: Finite Rank-Biased Overlap (FRBO), an enhanced similarity tailored explicitly for finite rankings. This innovation facilitates a more intuitive evaluation in practical settings. In pursuit of our goal, we empirically investigate the impact of removing items at different positions within a temporally ordered sequence. We evaluate two distinct SRS models across multiple datasets, measuring their performance using metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Rank List Sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that removing items at the end of the sequence has a statistically significant impact on performance, with NDCG decreasing up to 60%. Conversely, removing items from the beginning or middle has no significant effect. These findings underscore the criticality of the position of perturbed items in the training data. As we spotlight the vulnerabilities inherent in current SRSs, we fervently advocate for intensified research efforts to fortify their robustness against adversarial perturbations.

> Recent research has revealed that natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, the current techniques for generating such examples rely on deterministic heuristic rules, which fail to produce optimal adversarial examples. In response, this study proposes a new method called the Fraud's Bargain Attack (FBA), which uses a randomization mechanism to expand the search space and produce high-quality adversarial examples with a higher probability of success. FBA uses the Metropolis-Hasting sampler, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, to improve the selection of adversarial examples from all candidates generated by a customized stochastic process called the Word Manipulation Process (WMP). The WMP method modifies individual words in a contextually-aware manner through insertion, removal, or substitution. Through extensive experiments, this study demonstrates that FBA outperforms other methods in terms of attack success rate, imperceptibility and sentence quality.

> Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, such as LoRa, have gained significant attention for their ability to enable long-range, low-power communication for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the security of LoRa networks remains a major concern, particularly in scenarios where device identification and classification of legitimate and spoofed signals are crucial. This paper studies a deep learning framework to address these challenges, considering LoRa device identification and legitimate vs. rogue LoRa device classification tasks. A deep neural network (DNN), either a convolutional neural network (CNN) or feedforward neural network (FNN), is trained for each task by utilizing real experimental I/Q data for LoRa signals, while rogue signals are generated by using kernel density estimation (KDE) of received signals by rogue devices. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)-based adversarial attacks are considered for LoRa signal classification tasks using deep learning models. The impact of these attacks is assessed on the performance of two tasks, namely device identification and legitimate vs. rogue device classification, by utilizing separate or common perturbations against these signal classification tasks. Results presented in this paper quantify the level of transferability of adversarial attacks on different LoRa signal classification tasks as a major vulnerability and highlight the need to make IoT applications robust to adversarial attacks.

> Multi-Task Learning (MTL) involves developing a singular model, known as a multi-task model, to concurrently perform multiple tasks. While the security of single-task models has been thoroughly studied, multi-task models pose several critical security questions, such as 1) their vulnerability to single-task adversarial attacks, 2) the possibility of designing attacks that target multiple tasks, and 3) the impact of task sharing and adversarial training on their resilience to such attacks. This paper addresses these queries through detailed analysis and rigorous experimentation. First, we explore the adaptation of single-task white-box attacks to multi-task models and identify their limitations. We then introduce a novel attack framework, the Gradient Balancing Multi-Task Attack (GB-MTA), which treats attacking a multi-task model as an optimization problem. This problem, based on averaged relative loss change across tasks, is approximated as an integer linear programming problem. Extensive evaluations on MTL benchmarks, NYUv2 and Tiny-Taxonomy, demonstrate GB-MTA's effectiveness against both standard and adversarially trained multi-task models. The results also highlight a trade-off between task accuracy improvement via parameter sharing and increased model vulnerability due to enhanced attack transferability.

> Adversarial examples are well-known tools to evaluate the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs). Although lots of adversarial attack algorithms have been developed, it is still challenging in the practical scenario that the model's parameters and architectures are inaccessible to the attacker/evaluator, i.e., black-box adversarial attacks. Due to the practical importance, there has been rapid progress from recent algorithms, reflected by the quick increase in attack success rate and the quick decrease in query numbers to the target model. However, there is a lack of thorough evaluations and comparisons among these algorithms, causing difficulties of tracking the real progress, analyzing advantages and disadvantages of different technical routes, as well as designing future development roadmap of this field. Thus, in this work, we aim at building a comprehensive benchmark of black-box adversarial attacks, called BlackboxBench. It mainly provides: 1) a unified, extensible and modular-based codebase, implementing 25 query-based attack algorithms and 30 transfer-based attack algorithms; 2) comprehensive evaluations: we evaluate the implemented algorithms against several mainstreaming model architectures on 2 widely used datasets (CIFAR-10 and a subset of ImageNet), leading to 14,106 evaluations in total; 3) thorough analysis and new insights, as well analytical tools.

Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for developing robust and secure applications. In this paper, we investigate the impact of test time adversarial attacks through edge perturbations which involve both edge insertions and deletions. A novel explainability-based method is proposed to identify important nodes in the graph and perform edge perturbation between these nodes. The proposed method is tested for node classification with three different architectures and datasets. The results suggest that introducing edges between nodes of different classes has higher impact as compared to removing edges among nodes within the same class.

> This paper addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with deep neural language models, which serve as crucial components in various modern AI-based applications. These models are often used after being pre-trained and fine-tuned for specific tasks, with deployment on servers accessed through the internet. However, this introduces two fundamental risks: (a) the transmission of user inputs to the server via the network gives rise to interception vulnerabilities, and (b) privacy concerns emerge as organizations that deploy such models store user data with restricted context. To address this, we propose a novel method to adapt and fine-tune transformer-based language models on passkey-encrypted user-specific text. The original pre-trained language model first undergoes a quick adaptation (without any further pre-training) with a series of irreversible transformations applied to the tokenizer and token embeddings. This enables the model to perform inference on encrypted inputs while preventing reverse engineering of text from model parameters and intermediate outputs. After adaptation, models are fine-tuned on encrypted versions of existing training datasets. Experimental evaluation employing adapted versions of renowned models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) across established benchmark English and multilingual datasets for text classification and sequence labeling shows that encrypted models achieve performance parity with their original counterparts. This serves to safeguard performance, privacy, and security cohesively.

> Database systems are widely used to store and query data. Test oracles have been proposed to find logic bugs in such systems, that is, bugs that cause the database system to compute an incorrect result. To realize a fully automated testing approach, such test oracles are paired with a test case generation technique; a test case refers to a database state and a query on which the test oracle can be applied. In this work, we propose the concept of Query Plan Guidance (QPG) for guiding automated testing towards "interesting" test cases. SQL and other query languages are declarative. Thus, to execute a query, the database system translates every operator in the source language to one of potentially many so-called physical operators that can be executed; the tree of physical operators is referred to as the query plan. Our intuition is that by steering testing towards exploring diverse query plans, we also explore more interesting behaviors-some of which are potentially incorrect. To this end, we propose a mutation technique that gradually applies promising mutations to the database state, causing the DBMS to create diverse query plans for subsequent queries. We applied our method to three mature, widely-used, and extensively-tested database systems-SQLite, TiDB, and CockroachDB-and found 53 unique, previously unknown bugs. Our method exercises 4.85-408.48X more unique query plans than a naive random generation method and 7.46X more than a code coverage guidance method. Since most database systems-including commercial ones-expose query plans to the user, we consider QPG a generally applicable, black-box approach and believe that the core idea could also be applied in other contexts (e.g., to measure the quality of a test suite).

> In offline imitation learning (IL), an agent aims to learn an optimal expert behavior policy without additional online environment interactions. However, in many real-world scenarios, such as robotics manipulation, the offline dataset is collected from suboptimal behaviors without rewards. Due to the scarce expert data, the agents usually suffer from simply memorizing poor trajectories and are vulnerable to variations in the environments, lacking the capability of generalizing to new environments. To automatically generate high-quality expert data and improve the generalization ability of the agent, we propose a framework named \underline{O}ffline \underline{I}mitation \underline{L}earning with \underline{C}ounterfactual data \underline{A}ugmentation (OILCA) by doing counterfactual inference. In particular, we leverage identifiable variational autoencoder to generate \textit{counterfactual} samples for expert data augmentation. We theoretically analyze the influence of the generated expert data and the improvement of generalization. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms various baselines on both \textsc{DeepMind Control Suite} benchmark for in-distribution performance and \textsc{CausalWorld} benchmark for out-of-distribution generalization.

However, recent studies have shown that basic unconditional DMs (e.g., DDPM and DDIM) are vulnerable to backdoor injection, a type of output manipulation attack triggered by a maliciously embedded pattern at model input. This paper presents a unified backdoor attack framework (VillanDiffusion) to expand the current scope of backdoor analysis for DMs. Our framework covers mainstream unconditional and conditional DMs (denoising-based and score-based) and various training-free samplers for holistic evaluations. Experiments show that our unified framework facilitates the backdoor analysis of different DM configurations and provides new insights into caption-based backdoor attacks on DMs. Our code is available on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/IBM/villandiffusion}

> Security resources are scarce, and practitioners need guidance in the effective and efficient usage of techniques and tools available in the cybersecurity industry. Two emerging tool types, Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) and Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP), have not been thoroughly evaluated against well-established counterparts such as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST). The goal of this research is to aid practitioners in making informed choices about the use of Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) and Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) tools through an analysis of their effectiveness and efficiency in comparison with different vulnerability detection and prevention techniques and tools. We apply IAST and RASP on OpenMRS, an open-source Java-based online application. We compare the efficiency and effectiveness of IAST and RASP with techniques applied on OpenMRS in prior work. We measure efficiency and effectiveness in terms of the number and type of vulnerabilities detected and prevented per hour. Our study shows IAST performed relatively well compared to other techniques, performing second-best in both efficiency and effectiveness. IAST detected eight Top-10 OWASP security risks compared to nine by SMPT and seven for EMPT, DAST, and SAST. IAST found more vulnerabilities than SMPT. The efficiency of IAST (2.14 VpH) is second to only EMPT (2.22 VpH). These findings imply that our study benefited from using IAST when conducting black-box security testing. In the context of a large, enterprise-scale web application such as OpenMRS, RASP does not replace vulnerability detection, while IAST is a powerful tool that complements other techniques.

> Backdoor attacks in the traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) field are easily detectable due to the dilemma of confusing labels. To explore the backdoor vulnerability of GNNs and create a more stealthy backdoor attack method, a clean-label graph backdoor attack method(CGBA) in the node classification task is proposed in this paper. Differently from existing backdoor attack methods, CGBA requires neither modification of node labels nor graph structure. Specifically, to solve the problem of inconsistency between the contents and labels of the samples, CGBA selects poisoning samples in a specific target class and uses the label of sample as the target label (i.e., clean-label) after injecting triggers into the target samples. To guarantee the similarity of neighboring nodes, the raw features of the nodes are elaborately picked as triggers to further improve the concealment of the triggers. Extensive experiments results show the effectiveness of our method. When the poisoning rate is 0.04, CGBA can achieve an average attack success rate of 87.8%, 98.9%, 89.1%, and 98.5%, respectively.

> This paper presents a critical analysis of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) detection tools in higher education assessments. The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative AI, particularly in education, necessitates a reevaluation of traditional academic integrity mechanisms. We explore the effectiveness, vulnerabilities, and ethical implications of AI detection tools in the context of preserving academic integrity. Our study synthesises insights from various case studies, newspaper articles, and student testimonies to scrutinise the practical and philosophical challenges associated with AI detection. We argue that the reliance on detection mechanisms is misaligned with the educational landscape, where AI plays an increasingly widespread role. This paper advocates for a strategic shift towards robust assessment methods and educational policies that embrace generative AI usage while ensuring academic integrity and authenticity in assessments.

> Autonomous vehicles are advanced driving systems that are well known to be vulnerable to various adversarial attacks, compromising vehicle safety and posing a risk to other road users. Rather than actively training complex adversaries by interacting with the environment, there is a need to first intelligently find and reduce the search space to only those states where autonomous vehicles are found to be less confident. In this paper, we propose a black-box testing framework ReMAV that uses offline trajectories first to analyze the existing behavior of autonomous vehicles and determine appropriate thresholds to find the probability of failure events. To this end, we introduce a three-step methodology which i) uses offline state action pairs of any autonomous vehicle under test, ii) builds an abstract behavior representation using our designed reward modeling technique to analyze states with uncertain driving decisions, and iii) uses a disturbance model for minimal perturbation attacks where the driving decisions are less confident. Our reward modeling technique helps in creating a behavior representation that allows us to highlight regions of likely uncertain behavior even when the standard autonomous vehicle performs well. We perform our experiments in a high-fidelity urban driving environment using three different driving scenarios containing single- and multi-agent interactions. Our experiment shows an increase in 35, 23, 48, and 50% in the occurrences of vehicle collision, road object collision, pedestrian collision, and offroad steering events, respectively by the autonomous vehicle under test, demonstrating a significant increase in failure events. We compare ReMAV with two baselines and show that ReMAV demonstrates significantly better effectiveness in generating failure events compared to the baselines in all evaluation metrics.

> Online behavioral advertising (OBA) has a significant role in the digital economy. It allows advertisers to target consumers categorized according to their algorithmically inferred interests based on their behavioral data. As Alphabet and Meta gatekeep the Internet with their digital platforms and channel most of the consumer attention online, they are best placed to execute OBA and earn profits far exceeding fair estimations. There are increasing concerns that gatekeepers achieve such profitability at the expense of consumers, advertisers, and publishers who are dependent on their services to access the Internet. In particular, some claim that OBA systematically exploits consumers' decision-making vulnerabilities, creating internet infrastructure and relevant markets that optimize for consumer manipulation.   Intuitively, consumer manipulation via OBA comes in tension with the ideal of consumer autonomy in liberal democracies. Nevertheless, academia has largely overlooked this phenomenon and instead has primarily focused on privacy and discrimination concerns of OBA. This article redirects academic discourse and regulatory focus on consumer manipulation via OBA. In doing so, first, this article elaborates on how OBA works. Second, it constructs an analytic framework for understanding manipulation. Third, it applies the theory of manipulation to OBA. As a result, this article illustrates the extent to which OBA leads to consumer manipulation. Crucially, this article is purely analytic and avoids normative evaluation of consumer manipulation via OBA. Evaluating consumer manipulation harms of OBA is an equally important but separate task and is pursued in another publication.

- *Chulin Xie, Yunhui Long, Pin-Yu Chen, Qinbin Li, Arash Nourian, Sanmi Koyejo, Bo Li*

- `2209.04030v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04030v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04030v3)

> Federated learning (FL) provides an efficient paradigm to jointly train a global model leveraging data from distributed users. As local training data comes from different users who may not be trustworthy, several studies have shown that FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Meanwhile, to protect the privacy of local users, FL is usually trained in a differentially private way (DPFL). Thus, in this paper, we ask: What are the underlying connections between differential privacy and certified robustness in FL against poisoning attacks? Can we leverage the innate privacy property of DPFL to provide certified robustness for FL? Can we further improve the privacy of FL to improve such robustness certification? We first investigate both user-level and instance-level privacy of FL and provide formal privacy analysis to achieve improved instance-level privacy. We then provide two robustness certification criteria: certified prediction and certified attack inefficacy for DPFL on both user and instance levels. Theoretically, we provide the certified robustness of DPFL based on both criteria given a bounded number of adversarial users or instances. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to verify our theories under a range of poisoning attacks on different datasets. We find that increasing the level of privacy protection in DPFL results in stronger certified attack inefficacy; however, it does not necessarily lead to a stronger certified prediction. Thus, achieving the optimal certified prediction requires a proper balance between privacy and utility loss.

> As Large Language Models (LLMs) play an increasingly pivotal role in natural language processing applications, their safety concerns become critical areas of NLP research. This paper presents Safety and Over-Defensiveness Evaluation (SODE) benchmark: a collection of diverse safe and unsafe prompts with carefully designed evaluation methods that facilitate systematic evaluation, comparison, and analysis over 'safety' and 'over-defensiveness.' With SODE, we study a variety of LLM defense strategies over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, which reveals several interesting and important findings, such as (a) the widely popular 'self-checking' techniques indeed improve the safety against unsafe inputs, but this comes at the cost of extreme over-defensiveness on the safe inputs, (b) providing a safety instruction along with in-context exemplars (of both safe and unsafe inputs) consistently improves safety and also mitigates undue over-defensiveness of the models, (c) providing contextual knowledge easily breaks the safety guardrails and makes the models more vulnerable to generating unsafe responses. Overall, our work reveals numerous such critical findings that we believe will pave the way and facilitate further research in improving the safety of LLMs.

> The Windows authentication infrastructure relies on the Local Security Authority (LSA) system, with its integral component being lsass.exe. Regrettably, this framework is not impervious, presenting vulnerabilities that attract threat actors with malicious intent. By exploiting documented vulnerabilities sourced from the CVE database or leveraging sophisticated tools such as mimikatz, adversaries can successfully compromise user password-address information.   In this comprehensive analysis, we delve into proactive measures aimed at fortifying the local authentication subsystem against potential threats. Moreover, we present empirical evidence derived from practical assessments of various defensive methodologies, including those articulated previously. This examination not only underscores the importance of proactive security measures but also assesses the practical efficacy of these strategies in real-world contexts.

> Deep Learning models have become an integrated component of modern software systems. In response to the challenge of model design, researchers proposed Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems, which automatically search for model architecture and hyperparameters for a given task. Like other software systems, existing AutoML systems suffer from bugs. We identify two common and severe bugs in AutoML, performance bug (i.e., searching for the desired model takes an unreasonably long time) and ineffective search bug (i.e., AutoML systems are not able to find an accurate enough model). After analyzing the workflow of AutoML, we observe that existing AutoML systems overlook potential opportunities in search space, search method, and search feedback, which results in performance and ineffective search bugs. Based on our analysis, we design and implement DREAM, an automatic debugging and repairing system for AutoML systems. It monitors the process of AutoML to collect detailed feedback and automatically repairs bugs by expanding search space and leveraging a feedback-driven search strategy. Our evaluation results show that DREAM can effectively and efficiently repair AutoML bugs.

- `2401.01377v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01377v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01377v1)

> The field of few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promising results in scenarios where training data is limited, but its vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. We first explore this topic by first evaluating the performance of the existing backdoor attack methods on few-shot learning scenarios. Unlike in standard supervised learning, existing backdoor attack methods failed to perform an effective attack in FSL due to two main issues. Firstly, the model tends to overfit to either benign features or trigger features, causing a tough trade-off between attack success rate and benign accuracy. Secondly, due to the small number of training samples, the dirty label or visible trigger in the support set can be easily detected by victims, which reduces the stealthiness of attacks. It seemed that FSL could survive from backdoor attacks. However, in this paper, we propose the Few-shot Learning Backdoor Attack (FLBA) to show that FSL can still be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first generate a trigger to maximize the gap between poisoned and benign features. It enables the model to learn both benign and trigger features, which solves the problem of overfitting. To make it more stealthy, we hide the trigger by optimizing two types of imperceptible perturbation, namely attractive and repulsive perturbation, instead of attaching the trigger directly. Once we obtain the perturbations, we can poison all samples in the benign support set into a hidden poisoned support set and fine-tune the model on it. Our method demonstrates a high Attack Success Rate (ASR) in FSL tasks with different few-shot learning paradigms while preserving clean accuracy and maintaining stealthiness. This study reveals that few-shot learning still suffers from backdoor attacks, and its security should be given attention.

> Recently, deep learning models have been widely applied in program understanding tasks, and these models achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmark datasets. A major challenge of deep learning for program understanding is that the effectiveness of these approaches depends on the quality of their datasets, and these datasets often contain noisy data samples. A typical kind of noise in program understanding datasets is label noise, which means that the target outputs for some inputs are incorrect.   Researchers have proposed various approaches to alleviate the negative impact of noisy labels, and formed a new research topic: noisy label learning (NLL). In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the effectiveness of noisy label learning on deep learning for program understanding datasets. We evaluate various NLL approaches and deep learning models on three tasks: program classification, vulnerability detection, and code summarization. From the evaluation results, we come to the following findings: 1) small trained-from-scratch models are prone to label noises in program understanding, while large pre-trained models are highly robust against them. 2) NLL approaches significantly improve the program classification accuracies for small models on noisy training sets, but they only slightly benefit large pre-trained models in classification accuracies. 3) NLL can effectively detect synthetic noises in program understanding, but struggle in detecting real-world noises. We believe our findings can provide insights on the abilities of NLL in program understanding, and shed light on future works in tackling noises in software engineering datasets. We have released our code at https://github.com/jacobwwh/noise_SE.
