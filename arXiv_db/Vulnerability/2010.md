> Online labor markets give people in poor countries direct access to buyers in rich countries. Economic theory and empirical evidence strongly suggest that this kind of access improves human welfare. However, critics claim that abuses are endemic in these markets and that employers exploit unprotected, vulnerable workers. I investigate part of this claim using a randomized, paired survey in which I ask workers in an online labor market (Amazon Mechanical Turk) how they perceive online employers and employers in their host country in terms of honesty and fairness. I find that, on average, workers perceive the collection of online employers as slightly fairer and more honest than offline employers, though the effect is not significant. Views are more polarized in the online employer case, with more respondents having very positive views of the online collection of employers.

> The traditional worms such as Blaster, Code Red, Slammer and Sasser, are still infecting vulnerable machines on the internet. They will remain as significant threats due to their fast spreading nature on the internet. Various traditional worms attack pattern has been analyzed from various logs at different OSI layers such as victim logs, attacker logs and IDS alert log. These worms attack pattern can be abstracted to form worms' attack model which describes the process of worms' infection. For the purpose of this paper, only Blaster variants were used during the experiment. This paper proposes a multi-step worm attack model which can be extended into research areas in alert correlation and computer forensic investigation.

- `1001.3484v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3484v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.3484v1)

> The phenomenon described as "information criminality" has taken significant proportions in the last decade, fact that carried out towards an international legislative frame, by implementing judicial forms, which might stop its occurrences. As matter of fact, the information criminality represents an information technology aiming towards fraud and prejudicing the users of informational data, by various means to infringement of the law. In this way, some international organizations have dealt with performing a legislative framework, able to punish the phenomenon of information criminality and implicitly to protect the users of computers. The transnational expansions, extremely fast as concerns the computer networks, and extending the access to these networks, by means of mobile telephony, have brought the increasing of these systems' vulnerability and the creating of opportunities of breaking the law. Considering these aspects, the world legislation is continuously changing, due to a more and more accelerated development of the information technology.

<summary>2010-02-08 18:52:05 - Avoiding Black Hole and Cooperative Black Hole Attacks in Wireless Ad hoc Networks</summary>

- *Abderrahmane Baadache, Ali Belmehdi*

- `1002.1681v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1681v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1681v1)

> In wireless ad hoc networks, the absence of any control on packets forwarding, make these networks vulnerable by various deny of service attacks (DoS). A node, in wireless ad hoc network, counts always on intermediate nodes to send these packets to a given destination node. An intermediate node, which takes part in packets forwarding, may behave maliciously and drop packets which goes through it, instead of forwarding them to the following node. Such behavior is called black hole attack. In this paper, after having specified the black hole attack, a secure mechanism, which consists in checking the good forwarding of packets by an intermediate node, was proposed. The proposed solution avoids the black hole and the cooperative black hole attacks. Evaluation metrics were considered in simulation to show the effectiveness of the suggested solution.

<summary>2010-03-07 11:03:18 - Securing Iris Templates using Combined User and Soft Biometric based Password Hardened Fuzzy Vault</summary>

- *V. S. Meenakshi, G. Padmavathi*

- `1003.1449v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1449v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1449v1)

> Personal identification and authentication is very crucial in the current scenario. Biometrics plays an important role in this area. Biometric based authentication has proved superior compared to traditional password based authentication. Anyhow biometrics is permanent feature of a person and cannot be reissued when compromised as passwords. To over come this problem, instead of storing the original biometric templates transformed templates can be stored. Whenever the transformation function is changed new revocable/cancelable templates are generated. Soft biometrics is ancillary information that can be combined with primary biometrics to identify a person in a better way. Iris has certain advantage compared to other biometric traits like fingerprint. Iris is an internal part that is less prone to damage. Moreover is very difficult for an attacker to capture an iris. The key advantage of iris biometrics is its stability or template longevity. Biometric systems are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. This work generates cancelable iris templates by applying user and soft biometric based password transformations and further secures the templates by biometric cryptographic construct fuzzy vault.

- `1003.1515v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1515v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1515v1)

> Wireless Networks rendering varied services has not only become the order of the day but the demand of a large pool of customers as well. Thus, security of wireless networks has become a very essential design criterion. This paper describes our research work focused towards creating secure cognitive wireless local area networks using soft computing approaches. The present dense Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) pose a huge threat to network integrity and are vulnerable to attacks. In this paper we propose a secure Cognitive Framework Architecture (CFA). The Cognitive Security Manager (CSM) is the heart of CFA. The CSM incorporates access control using Physical Architecture Description Layer (PADL) and analyzes the operational matrices of the terminals using multi layer neural networks, acting accordingly to identify authorized access and unauthorized usage patterns.

- `1001.1877v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1877v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.1877v3)

> This note analyses one of the existing space efficient secret sharing schemes and suggests vulnerabilities in its design. We observe that the said algorithm fails for certain choices of the set of secrets and there is no reason for preferring this particular scheme over alternative schemes. The paper also elaborates the adoption of a scheme proposed by Hugo Krawczyk as an extension of Shamir's scheme, for a set of secrets. Such an implementation is space optimal and works for all choices of secrets. We also propose two new methods of attack which are valid under certain assumptions and observe that it is the elimination of random values that facilitates these kinds of attacks.

<summary>2010-03-11 22:59:20 - Stochastic Games for Security in Networks with Interdependent Nodes</summary>

- *Kien C. Nguyen, Tansu Alpcan, Tamer Basar*

- `1003.2440v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2440v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2440v1)

> This paper studies a stochastic game theoretic approach to security and intrusion detection in communication and computer networks. Specifically, an Attacker and a Defender take part in a two-player game over a network of nodes whose security assets and vulnerabilities are correlated. Such a network can be modeled using weighted directed graphs with the edges representing the influence among the nodes. The game can be formulated as a non-cooperative zero-sum or nonzero-sum stochastic game. However, due to correlation among the nodes, if some nodes are compromised, the effective security assets and vulnerabilities of the remaining ones will not stay the same in general, which leads to complex system dynamics. We examine existence, uniqueness, and structure of the solution and also provide numerical examples to illustrate our model.

- `1003.2614v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2614v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2614v1)

> In cluster-based routing protocol (CBRP), two-level hierarchical structure is successfully used to reduce over-flooding in wireless Ad Hoc networks. As it is vulnerable to a single point of failure, we propose a new adaptive distributed threshold scheme to replace the cluster head by a group of cluster heads within each cluster, called COUNCIL, and distribute the service of single cluster head to multiple cluster heads using (k,n) threshold secret sharing scheme. An Ad Hoc network formed by COUNCIL based clusters can work correctly when the number of compromised cluster heads is smaller than k. To implement this adaptive threshold scheme in wireless Ad Hoc Networks, membership of the clusters should be defined in an adaptive way. In this paper, we mainly discuss our algorithm for forming COUNCIL based clusters using the concept of dominating set from graph theory.

- `1003.3242v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3242v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.3242v3)

> As the amount of personal information stored at remote service providers increases, so does the danger of data theft. When connections to remote services are made in the clear and authenticated sessions are kept using HTTP cookies, data theft becomes extremely easy to achieve. In this paper, we study the architecture of the world's largest service provider, i.e., Google. First, with the exception of a few services that can only be accessed over HTTPS (e.g., Gmail), we find that many Google services are still vulnerable to simple session hijacking. Next, we present the Historiographer, a novel attack that reconstructs the web search history of Google users, i.e., Google's Web History, even though such a service is supposedly protected from session hijacking by a stricter access control policy. The Historiographer uses a reconstruction technique inferring search history from the personalized suggestions fed by the Google search engine. We validate our technique through experiments conducted over real network traffic and discuss possible countermeasures. Our attacks are general and not only specific to Google, and highlight privacy concerns of mixed architectures using both secure and insecure connections.

<summary>2010-04-05 08:48:54 - Dynamic IDP Signature processing by fast elimination using DFA</summary>

- *Mohammed Misbahuddin, Sachin Narayanan, Bishwa Ranjan Ghosh*

- `1004.0594v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0594v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.0594v1)

> Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems generally aims at detecting / preventing attacks against Information systems and networks. The basic task of IDPS is to monitor network & system traffic for any malicious packets/patterns and hence to prevent any unwarranted incidents which leads the systems to insecure state. The monitoring is done by checking each packet for its validity against the signatures formulated for identified vulnerabilities. Since, signatures are the heart & soul of an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), we, in this paper, discuss two methodologies we adapted in our research effort to improve the current Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) systems. The first methodology RUDRAA is for formulating, verifying & validating the potential signatures to be used with IDPS. The second methodology DSP-FED is aimed at processing the signatures in less time with our proposed fast elimination method using DFA. The research objectives of this project are 1) To formulate & process potential IPS signatures to be used with Intrusion prevention system. 2) To propose a DFA based approach for signature processing which, upon a pattern match, could process the signatures faster else could eliminate it efficiently if not matched

- `1004.0767v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0767v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.0767v1)

> In 2004, Das, Saxena and Gulati proposed a dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme which has many advantage such as no verifier table, user freedom to choose and change password and so on. However the subsequent papers have shown that this scheme is completely insecure and vulnerable to many attacks. Since then many schemes with improvements to Das et al's scheme has been proposed but each has its pros and cons. Recently Yan-yan Wang et al. have proposed a scheme to overcome security weaknesses of Das et al.'s scheme. However this scheme too is vulnerable to various security attacks such as password guessing attack, masquerading attack, denial of service attack.

- `1004.1769v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1769v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.1769v1)

> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Flaws are currently the most popular security problems in modern web applications. These Flaws make use of vulnerabilities in the code of web-applications, resulting in serious consequences, such as theft of cookies, passwords and other personal credentials. Cross-Site scripting Flaws occur when accessing information in intermediate trusted sites. Client side solution acts as a web proxy to mitigate Cross Site Scripting Flaws which manually generated rules to mitigate Cross Site Scripting attempts. Client side solution effectively protects against information leakage from the user's environment. Cross Site Scripting Flaws are easy to execute, but difficult to detect and prevent. This paper provides client-side solution to mitigate cross-site scripting Flaws. The existing client-side solutions degrade the performance of client's system resulting in a poor web surfing experience. In this project provides a client side solution that uses a step by step approach to protect cross site scripting, without degrading much the user's web browsing experience.

<summary>2010-04-13 05:31:22 - Learning Character Strings via Mastermind Queries, with a Case Study Involving mtDNA</summary>

- *Michael T. Goodrich*

- `0904.4458v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4458v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.4458v2)

> We study the degree to which a character string, $Q$, leaks details about itself any time it engages in comparison protocols with a strings provided by a querier, Bob, even if those protocols are cryptographically guaranteed to produce no additional information other than the scores that assess the degree to which $Q$ matches strings offered by Bob. We show that such scenarios allow Bob to play variants of the game of Mastermind with $Q$ so as to learn the complete identity of $Q$. We show that there are a number of efficient implementations for Bob to employ in these Mastermind attacks, depending on knowledge he has about the structure of $Q$, which show how quickly he can determine $Q$. Indeed, we show that Bob can discover $Q$ using a number of rounds of test comparisons that is much smaller than the length of $Q$, under reasonable assumptions regarding the types of scores that are returned by the cryptographic protocols and whether he can use knowledge about the distribution that $Q$ comes from. We also provide the results of a case study we performed on a database of mitochondrial DNA, showing the vulnerability of existing real-world DNA data to the Mastermind attack.

- `1004.3057v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.3057v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.3057v1)

> Users often wish to participate in online groups anonymously, but misbehaving users may abuse this anonymity to spam or disrupt the group. Messaging protocols such as Mix-nets and DC-nets leave online groups vulnerable to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks, while accountable voting protocols are unusable or inefficient for general anonymous messaging.   We present the first general messaging protocol that offers provable anonymity with accountability for moderate-size groups, and efficiently handles unbalanced loads where few members have much data to transmit in a given round. The N group members first cooperatively shuffle an NxN matrix of pseudorandom seeds, then use these seeds in N "pre-planned" DC-nets protocol runs. Each DC-nets run transmits the variable-length bulk data comprising one member's message, using the minimum number of bits required for anonymity under our attack model. The protocol preserves message integrity and one-to-one correspondence between members and messages, makes denial-of-service attacks by members traceable to the culprit, and efficiently handles large and unbalanced message loads. A working prototype demonstrates the protocol's practicality for anonymous messaging in groups of 40+ member nodes.

- `1004.4089v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4089v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.4089v1)

> The premise of automated alert correlation is to accept that false alerts from a low level intrusion detection system are inevitable and use attack models to explain the output in an understandable way. Several algorithms exist for this purpose which use attack graphs to model the ways in which attacks can be combined. These algorithms can be classified in to two broad categories namely scenario-graph approaches, which create an attack model starting from a vulnerability assessment and type-graph approaches which rely on an abstract model of the relations between attack types. Some research in to improving the efficiency of type-graph correlation has been carried out but this research has ignored the hypothesizing of missing alerts. Our work is to present a novel type-graph algorithm which unifies correlation and hypothesizing in to a single operation. Our experimental results indicate that the approach is extremely efficient in the face of intensive alerts and produces compact output graphs comparable to other techniques.

- `1004.1237v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1237v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.1237v2)

> Almost all existing RFID authentication schemes (tag/reader) are vulnerable to relay attacks, because of their inability to estimate the distance to the tag. These attacks are very serious since it can be mounted without the notice of neither the reader nor the tag and cannot be prevented by cryptographic protocols that operate at the application layer. Distance bounding protocols represent a promising way to thwart relay attacks, by measuring the round trip time of short authenticated messages. All the existing distance bounding protocols use random number generator and hash functions at the tag side which make them inapplicable at low cost RFID tags. This paper proposes a lightweight distance bound protocol for low cost RFID tags. The proposed protocol based on modified version of Gossamer mutual authentication protocol. The implementation of the proposed protocol meets the limited abilities of low-cost RFID tags.

> E-Commerce offers the banking industry great opportunity, but also creates a set of new risks and vulnerability such as security threats. Information security, therefore, is an essential management and technical requirement for any efficient and effective Payment transaction activities over the internet. Still, its definition is a complex endeavor due to the constant technological and business change and requires a coordinated match of algorithm and technical solutions. Ecommerce is not appropriate to all business transactions and, within e-commerce there is no one technology that can or should be appropriate to all requirements. E-commerce is not a new phenomenon; electronic markets, electronic data interchange and customer e-commerce. The use of electronic data interchanges as a universal and non-proprietary way of doing business. Through the electronic transaction the security is the most important phenomena to enhance the banking transaction security via payment transaction.

- `0912.2843v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2843v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.2843v2)

> Mobile ad hoc networking (MANET) has become an exciting and important technology in recent years because of the rapid proliferation of wireless devices. MANETs are highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology and lack of centralized monitoring point. It is important to search new architecture and mechanisms to protect the wireless networks and mobile computing application. IDS analyze the network activities by means of audit data and use patterns of well-known attacks or normal profile to detect potential attacks. There are two methods to analyze: misuse detection and anomaly detection. Misuse detection is not effective against unknown attacks and therefore, anomaly detection method is used. In this approach, the audit data is collected from each mobile node after simulating the attack and compared with the normal behavior of the system. If there is any deviation from normal behavior then the event is considered as an attack. Some of the features of collected audit data may be redundant or contribute little to the detection process. So it is essential to select the important features to increase the detection rate. This paper focuses on implementing two feature selection methods namely, markov blanket discovery and genetic algorithm. In genetic algorithm, bayesian network is constructed over the collected features and fitness function is calculated. Based on the fitness value the features are selected. Markov blanket discovery also uses bayesian network and the features are selected depending on the minimum description length. During the evaluation phase, the performances of both approaches are compared based on detection rate and false alarm rate.

- `1005.5130v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5130v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.5130v2)

> The research effort on mobile computing has focused mainly on routing and usually assumes that all mobile devices (MDs) are cooperative. These assumptions hold on military or search and rescue operations, where all hosts are from the same authority and their users have common goals. The application of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as open networks has emerged recently but proliferated exponentially. Energy is a valuable commodity in MANETs due to the limited battery of the portable devices. Batteries typically cannot be replaced in MANETs, making their lifetime limited. Diverse users, with unlike goals, share the resources of their devices and ensuring global connectivity comes very low in their priority. This sort of communities can already be found in wired networks, namely on peer-to-peer networks. In this scenario, open MANETs will likely resemble social environments. A group of persons can provide benefits to each of its members as long as everyone provides his contribution. For our particular case, each element of a MANET will be called to forward messages and to participate on routing protocols. A selfish behavior threatens the entire community and also this behavior is infectious as, other MDs may also start to perform in the same way. In the extreme, this can take to the complete sabotage of the network. This paper investigates the prevalent malicious attacks in MANET and analyzes recent selfish trends in MANET. We analyzed the respective strengths and vulnerabilities of the existing selfish behaviour prevention scheme.

- `1006.1192v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1192v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.1192v1)

> Secret sharing in user hierarchy represents a challenging area for research. Although a lot of work has already been done in this direc- tion, this paper presents a novel approach to share a secret among a hierarchy of users while overcoming the limitations of the already exist- ing mechanisms. Our work is based on traditional (k +1; n)-threshold secret sharing, which is secure as long as an adversary can compromise not more than k secret shares. But in real life it is often feasible for an adversary to obtain more than k shares over a long period of time. So, in our work we also present a way to overcome this vulnerability, while implementing our hierarchical secret sharing scheme. The use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography makes the computations easier and faster in our work.

The central theme of the workshop is the decentralized coordination of distributed processes. Decentralized: there is no single authority in the network that everything is vulnerable to. Coordinated: processes need to cooperate to achieve meaningful results, potentially in the face of mutual suspicion. Distributed: processes are separated by a potentially unreliable network.

> In this work we start walking the path to a new perspective for viewing cyberwarfare scenarios, by introducing conceptual tools (a formal model) to evaluate the costs of an attack, to describe the theater of operations, targets, missions, actions, plans and assets involved in cyberwarfare attacks. We also describe two applications of this model: autonomous planning leading to automated penetration tests, and attack simulations, allowing a system administrator to evaluate the vulnerabilities of his network.

> We introduce a new simulation platform called Insight, created to design and simulate cyber-attacks against large arbitrary target scenarios. Insight has surprisingly low hardware and configuration requirements, while making the simulation a realistic experience from the attacker's standpoint. The scenarios include a crowd of simulated actors: network devices, hardware devices, software applications, protocols, users, etc. A novel characteristic of this tool is to simulate vulnerabilities (including 0-days) and exploits, allowing an attacker to compromise machines and use them as pivoting stones to continue the attack. A user can test and modify complex scenarios, with several interconnected networks, where the attacker has no initial connectivity with the objective of the attack. We give a concise description of this new technology, and its possible uses in the security research field, such as pentesting training, study of the impact of 0-days vulnerabilities, evaluation of security countermeasures, and risk assessment tool.

> In this work we present a prototype for simulating computer network attacks. Our objective is to simulate large networks (thousands of hosts, with applications and vulnerabilities) while remaining realistic from the attacker's point of view. The foundation for the simulator is a model of computer intrusions, based on the analysis of real world attacks. In particular we show how to interpret vulnerabilities and exploits as communication channels. This conceptual model gives a tool to describe the theater of operations, targets, actions and assets involved in multistep network attacks. We conclude with applications of the attack simulator.

> The vast majority of RFID authentication protocols assume the proximity between readers and tags due to the limited range of the radio channel. However, in real scenarios an intruder can be located between the prover (tag) and the verifier (reader) and trick this last one into thinking that the prover is in close proximity. This attack is generally known as a relay attack in which scope distance fraud, mafia fraud and terrorist attacks are included. Distance bounding protocols represent a promising countermeasure to hinder relay attacks. Several protocols have been proposed during the last years but vulnerabilities of major or minor relevance have been identified in most of them. In 2008, Kim et al. [1] proposed a new distance bounding protocol with the objective of being the best in terms of security, privacy, tag computational overhead and fault tolerance. In this paper, we analyze this protocol and we present a passive full disclosure attack, which allows an adversary to discover the long-term secret key of the tag. The presented attack is very relevant, since no security objectives are met in Kim et al.'s protocol. Then, design guidelines are introduced with the aim of facilitating protocol designers the stimulating task of designing secure and efficient schemes against relay attacks. Finally a new protocol, named Hitomi and inspired by [1], is designed conforming the guidelines proposed previously.

> In this paper, we analyze four authentication protocols of Bindu et al., Goriparthi et al., Wang et al. and H\"olbl et al.. After investigation, we reveal several weaknesses of these schemes. First, Bindu et al.'s protocol suffers from an insider impersonation attack if a malicious user obtains a lost smart card. Second, both Goriparthi et al.'s and Wang et al.'s protocols cannot withstand a DoS attack in the password change phase, i.e. an attacker can involve the phase to make user's password never be used in subsequent authentications. Third, H\"olbl et al.'s protocol is vulnerable to an insider attack since a legal but malevolent user can deduce KGC's secret key.

> Hiding information in network traffic may lead to leakage of confidential information. In this paper we introduce a new steganographic system: the PadSteg (Padding Steganography). To authors' best knowledge it is the first information hiding solution which represents interprotocol steganography i.e. usage of relation between two or more protocols from the TCP/IP stack to enable secret communication. PadSteg utilizes ARP and TCP protocols together with an Etherleak vulnerability (improper Ethernet frame padding) to facilitate secret communication for hidden groups in LANs (Local Area Networks). Basing on real network traces we confirm that PadSteg is feasible in today's networks and we estimate what steganographic bandwidth is achievable while limiting the chance of disclosure. We also point at possible countermeasures against PadSteg.

> Leakage of confidential information represents a serious security risk. Despite a number of novel, theoretical advances, it has been unclear if and how quantitative approaches to measuring leakage of confidential information could be applied to substantial, real-world programs. This is mostly due to the high complexity of computing precise leakage quantities. In this paper, we introduce a technique which makes it possible to decide if a program conforms to a quantitative policy which scales to large state-spaces with the help of bounded model checking.   Our technique is applied to a number of officially reported information leak vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel. Additionally, we also analysed authentication routines in the Secure Remote Password suite and of a Internet Message Support Protocol implementation. Our technique shows when there is unacceptable leakage; the same technique is also used to verify, for the first time, that the applied software patches indeed plug the information leaks.   This is the first demonstration of quantitative information flow addressing security concerns of real-world industrial programs.

> Internet worm infection continues to be one of top security threats and has been widely used by botnets to recruit new bots. In this work, we attempt to quantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key characteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the number of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree. Specifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential growth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. We analytically and empirically find that the number of children has asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on average half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98% of infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of infected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the generation follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length of the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with the total number of infected hosts. Next, we empirically study the infection structure of localized-scanning worms and surprisingly find that most of the above observations also apply to localized-scanning worms. Finally, we apply our findings to develop bot detection methods and study potential countermeasures for a botnet (e.g., Conficker C) that uses scan-based peer discovery to form a P2P-based botnet. Specifically, we demonstrate that targeted detection that focuses on the nodes with the largest number of children is an efficient way to expose bots. For example, our simulation shows that when 3.125% nodes are examined, targeted detection can reveal 22.36% bots. However, we also point out that future botnets may limit the maximum number of children to weaken targeted detection, without greatly slowing down the speed of worm infection.

> In this work, water distribution systems are regarded as large sparse planar graphs with complex network characteristics and the relationship between important topological features of the network (i.e. structural robustness and loop redundancy) and system resilience, viewed as the antonym to structural vulnerability, are assessed. Deterministic techniques from complex networks and spectral graph theory are utilized to quantify well-connectedness and estimate loop redundancy in the studied benchmark networks. By using graph connectivity and expansion properties, system robustness against node/link failures and isolation of the demand nodes from the source(s) are assessed and network tolerance against random failures and targeted attacks on their bridges and cut sets are analyzed. Among other measurements, two metrics of meshed-ness and algebraic connectivity are proposed as candidates for quantification of redundancy and robustness, respectively, in optimization design models. A brief discussion on the scope and limitations of the provided measurements in the analysis of operational reliability of water distribution systems is presented.

> In this paper, we analyze the security of an RFID authentication protocol proposed by Liu and Bailey [1], called Privacy and Authentication Protocol (PAP), and show its vulnerabilities and faulty assumptions. PAP is a privacy and authentication protocol designed for passive tags. The authors claim that the protocol, being resistant to commonly assumed attacks, requires little computation and provides privacy protection and authentication. Nevertheless, we propose two traceability attacks and an impersonation attack, in which the revealing of secret information (i.e., secret key and static identifier) shared between the tag and the reader is unnecessary. Moreover, we review all basic assumptions on which the design of the protocol resides, and show how many of them are incorrect and are contrary to the common assumptions in RFID systems.

Mitigations like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) or ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) created a significantly more difficult environment for vulnerability exploitation. Attackers, however, have recently developed new exploitation methods which are capable of bypassing the operating system's security protection mechanisms. In this paper we present a short summary of novel and known mitigation techniques against return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. The techniques described in this article are related mostly to x86-32 processors and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

> Problem statement: This paper examines Artificial Spiking Neural Network (ASNN) which inter-connects group of artificial neurons that uses a mathematical model with the aid of block cipher. The aim of undertaken this research is to come up with a block cipher where by the keys are randomly generated by ASNN which can then have any variable block length. This will show the private key is kept and do not have to be exchange to the other side of the communication channel so it present a more secure procedure of key scheduling. The process enables for a faster change in encryption keys and a network level encryption to be implemented at a high speed without the headache of factorization. Approach: The block cipher is converted in public cryptosystem and had a low level of vulnerability to attack from brute, and moreover can able to defend against linear attacks since the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) architecture convey non-linearity to the encryption/decryption procedures. Result: In this paper is present to use the Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with spiking neurons as its basic unit. The timing for the SNNs is considered and the output is encoded in 1's and 0's depending on the occurrence or not occurrence of spikes as well as the spiking neural networks use a sign function as activation function, and present the weights and the filter coefficients to be adjust, having more degrees of freedom than the classical neural networks. Conclusion: In conclusion therefore, encryption algorithm can be deployed in communication and security applications where data transfers are most crucial. So this paper, the neural block cipher proposed where the keys are generated by the SNN and the seed is considered the public key which generates the both keys on both sides In future therefore a new research will be conducted on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) impacts on communication.

> Web applications suffer from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that resulting from incomplete or incorrect input sanitization. Learning the structure of attack vectors could enrich the variety of manifestations in generated XSS attacks. In this study, we focus on generating more threatening XSS attacks for the state-of-the-art detection approaches that can find potential XSS vulnerabilities in Web applications, and propose a mechanism for structural learning of attack vectors with the aim of generating mutated XSS attacks in a fully automatic way. Mutated XSS attack generation depends on the analysis of attack vectors and the structural learning mechanism. For the kernel of the learning mechanism, we use a Hidden Markov model (HMM) as the structure of the attack vector model to capture the implicit manner of the attack vector, and this manner is benefited from the syntax meanings that are labeled by the proposed tokenizing mechanism. Bayes theorem is used to determine the number of hidden states in the model for generalizing the structure model. The paper has the contributions as following: (1) automatically learn the structure of attack vectors from practical data analysis to modeling a structure model of attack vectors, (2) mimic the manners and the elements of attack vectors to extend the ability of testing tool for identifying XSS vulnerabilities, (3) be helpful to verify the flaws of blacklist sanitization procedures of Web applications. We evaluated the proposed mechanism by Burp Intruder with a dataset collected from public XSS archives. The results show that mutated XSS attack generation can identify potential vulnerabilities.

As the scale of these applications grows, injection vulnerabilities such as SQL injection are major security challenges for developers today. This paper presents the technique of automatic query sanitization to automatically remove SQL injection vulnerabilities in code. In our technique, a combination of static analysis and program transformation are used to automatically instrument web applications with sanitization code. We have implemented this technique in a tool named ASSIST (Automatic and Static SQL Injection Sanitization Tool) for protecting Java-based web applications. Our experimental evaluation showed that our technique is effective against SQL injection vulnerabilities and has a low overhead.

> Spam messes up users inbox, consumes resources and spread attacks like DDoS, MiM, Phishing etc., Phishing is a byproduct of email and causes financial loss to users and loss of reputation to financial institutions. In this paper we study the characteristics of phishing and technology used by phishers. In order to counter anti phishing technology, phishers change their mode of operation; therefore continuous evaluation of phishing helps us to combat phishers effectively. We have collected seven hundred thousand spam from a corporate server for a period of 13 months from February 2008 to February 2009. From the collected date, we identified different kinds of phishing scams and mode of their operation. Our observation shows that phishers are dynamic and depend more on social engineering techniques rather than software vulnerabilities. We believe that this study would be useful to develop more efficient anti phishing methodologies.

> Quantum computers can break the RSA and El Gamal public-key cryptosystems, since they can factor integers and extract discrete logarithms. If we believe that quantum computers will someday become a reality, we would like to have \emph{post-quantum} cryptosystems which can be implemented today with classical computers, but which will remain secure even in the presence of quantum attacks.   In this article we show that the McEliece cryptosystem over \emph{well-permuted, well-scrambled} linear codes resists precisely the attacks to which the RSA and El Gamal cryptosystems are vulnerable---namely, those based on generating and measuring coset states. This eliminates the approach of strong Fourier sampling on which almost all known exponential speedups by quantum algorithms are based. Specifically, we show that the natural case of the Hidden Subgroup Problem to which the McEliece cryptosystem reduces cannot be solved by strong Fourier sampling, or by any measurement of a coset state. We start with recent negative results on quantum algorithms for Graph Isomorphism, which are based on particular subgroups of size two, and extend them to subgroups of arbitrary structure, including the automorphism groups of linear codes. This allows us to obtain the first rigorous results on the security of the McEliece cryptosystem in the face of quantum adversaries, strengthening its candidacy for post-quantum cryptography.

> In a multi-hop mobile ad hoc network (MANET) mobile nodes communicate with each other forming a cooperative radio network. Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the currently existing security algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, in efficient, and have low detection accuracy for nodes' misbehaviour. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and misbehaviour detection for developing an integrated security solution for MANETs. The redundancy of routing information in ad hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully co-operative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

> Spam messages muddle up users inbox, consume network resources, and build up DDoS attacks, spread malware. Our goal is to present a definite figure about the characteristics of spam and spam vulnerable email accounts. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing technology to combat spam effectively. We collected 400 thousand spam mails from a spam trap set up in a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months form January 2006 to February 2007. Spammers use common techniques to spam end users regardless of corporate server and public mail server. So we believe that our spam collection is a sample of world wide spam traffic. Studying the characteristics of this sample helps us to better understand the features of spam and spam vulnerable e-mail accounts. We believe that this analysis is highly useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques. In our analysis we classified spam based on attachment and contents. According to our study the four years old heavy users email accounts attract more spam than four years oldlight users mail accounts. The 14 months old relatively new email accounts don't receive spam. In some special cases like DDoS attacks, the new email accounts receive spam. During DDoS attack 14 months old heavy users email accounts have attracted more number of spam than 14 months old light users mail accounts.

> Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently attracted a lot of interest in the research community due their wide range of applications. Due to distributed nature of these networks and their deployment in remote areas, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their proper functioning. This problem is more critical if the network is deployed for some mission-critical applications such as in a tactical battlefield. Random failure of nodes is also very likely in real-life deployment scenarios. Due to resource constraints in the sensor nodes, traditional security mechanisms with large overhead of computation and communication are infeasible in WSNs. Security in sensor networks is, therefore, a particularly challenging task. This paper discusses the current state of the art in security mechanisms for WSNs. Various types of attacks are discussed and their countermeasures presented. A brief discussion on the future direction of research in WSN security is also included.

Unfortunately, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their proper functioning. This problem is more critical if the network is deployed for some mission-critical applications such as in a tactical battlefield. Random failure of nodes and intentional compromise of nodes by an insider attack in a WSN pose particularly difficult challenges to security engineers as these attacks cannot be defended by traditional cryptography-based mechanisms. In this paper, a security solution is proposed for detecting compromised and faulty nodes in a WSN. The mechanism also isolates a compromised node from the network so that it cannot participate in any network activity. The proposed mechanism is based on misbehavior classification, behaviour monitoring and trust management. It involves minimum computation and communication overhead and is ideally suited for a resource-constrained, high-integrity WSN.

> In a previous FAST paper, I presented a quantitative model of the process of trust building, and showed that trust is accumulated like wealth: the rich get richer. This explained the pervasive phenomenon of adverse selection of trust certificates, as well as the fragility of trust networks in general. But a simple explanation does not always suggest a simple solution. It turns out that it is impossible to alter the fragile distribution of trust without sacrificing some of its fundamental functions. A solution for the vulnerability of trust must thus be sought elsewhere, without tampering with its distribution. This observation was the starting point of the present paper. It explores a different method for securing trust: not by redistributing it, but by mining for its sources. The method used to break privacy is thus also used to secure trust. A high level view of the mining methods that connect the two is provided in terms of *similarity networks*, and *spectral decomposition* of similarity preserving maps. This view may be of independent interest, as it uncovers a common conceptual and structural foundation of mathematical classification theory on one hand, and of the spectral methods of graph clustering and data mining on the other hand.

> Intrusion detection in wireless ad hoc networks is a challenging task because these networks change their topologies dynamically, lack concentration points where aggregated traffic can be analyzed, utilize infrastructure protocols that are susceptible to manipulation, and rely on noisy, intermittent wireless communications. Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection. Simulation results show effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture.
