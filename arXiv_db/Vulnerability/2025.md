> The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.

<summary>2025-01-01 10:46:22 - Make Shuffling Great Again: A Side-Channel Resistant Fisher-Yates Algorithm for Protecting Neural Networks</summary>

- *Leonard Puškáč, Marek Benovič, Jakub Breier, Xiaolu Hou*

- `2501.00798v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00798v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00798v1)

> Neural network models implemented in embedded devices have been shown to be susceptible to side-channel attacks (SCAs), allowing recovery of proprietary model parameters, such as weights and biases. There are already available countermeasure methods currently used for protecting cryptographic implementations that can be tailored to protect embedded neural network models. Shuffling, a hiding-based countermeasure that randomly shuffles the order of computations, was shown to be vulnerable to SCA when the Fisher-Yates algorithm is used. In this paper, we propose a design of an SCA-secure version of the Fisher-Yates algorithm. By integrating the masking technique for modular reduction and Blakely's method for modular multiplication, we effectively remove the vulnerability in the division operation that led to side-channel leakage in the original version of the algorithm. We experimentally evaluate that the countermeasure is effective against SCA by implementing a correlation power analysis attack on an embedded neural network model implemented on ARM Cortex-M4. Compared to the original proposal, the memory overhead is $2\times$ the biggest layer of the network, while the time overhead varies from $4\%$ to $0.49\%$ for a layer with $100$ and $1000$ neurons, respectively.

- *Huichi Zhou, Kin-Hei Lee, Zhonghao Zhan, Yue Chen, Zhenhao Li*

- `2501.00879v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00879v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00879v1)

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. However, these systems remain vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that can significantly degrade LLM performance through the injection of malicious content. To address these challenges, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters compromised and irrelevant content before it reaches the language model. Our approach implements a two-stage defense mechanism: first, it employs K-means clustering to identify potential attack patterns in retrieved documents based on their semantic embeddings, effectively isolating suspicious content. Second, it leverages cosine similarity and ROUGE metrics to detect malicious documents while resolving discrepancies between the model's internal knowledge and external information through a self-assessment process. TrustRAG functions as a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any language model, whether open or closed-source, maintaining high contextual relevance while strengthening defenses against attacks. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance compared to existing approaches across multiple model architectures and datasets. We have made TrustRAG available as open-source software at \url{https://github.com/HuichiZhou/TrustRAG}.

- *Jérémy Thibault, Roberto Blanco, Dongjae Lee, Sven Argo, Arthur Azevedo de Amorim, Aïna Linn Georges, Catalin Hritcu, Andrew Tolmach*

- `2401.16277v7` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16277v7) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16277v7)

> Undefined behavior in C often causes devastating security vulnerabilities. One practical mitigation is compartmentalization, which allows developers to structure large programs into mutually distrustful compartments with clearly specified privileges and interactions. In this paper we introduce SECOMP, a compiler for compartmentalized C code that comes with machine-checked proofs guaranteeing that the scope of undefined behavior is restricted to the compartments that encounter it and become dynamically compromised. These guarantees are formalized as the preservation of safety properties against adversarial contexts, a secure compilation criterion similar to full abstraction, and this is the first time such a strong criterion is proven for a mainstream programming language. To achieve this we extend the languages of the CompCert verified C compiler with isolated compartments that can only interact via procedure calls and returns, as specified by cross-compartment interfaces. We adapt the passes and optimizations of CompCert as well as their correctness proofs to this compartment-aware setting. We then use compiler correctness as an ingredient in a larger secure compilation proof that involves several proof engineering novelties, needed to scale formally secure compilation up to a C compiler.

- *Zhaoyu Chen, Haijing Guo, Kaixun Jiang, Jiyuan Fu, Xinyu Zhou, Dingkang Yang, Hao Tang, Bo Li, Wenqiang Zhang*

- `2501.01015v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01015v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01015v1)

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that exhibit transferability across various models. Numerous approaches are proposed to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples, including advanced optimization, data augmentation, and model modifications. However, these methods still show limited transferability, particularly in cross-architecture scenarios, such as from CNN to ViT. To achieve high transferability, we propose a technique termed Spatial Adversarial Alignment (SAA), which employs an alignment loss and leverages a witness model to fine-tune the surrogate model. Specifically, SAA consists of two key parts: spatial-aware alignment and adversarial-aware alignment. First, we minimize the divergences of features between the two models in both global and local regions, facilitating spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a self-adversarial strategy that leverages adversarial examples to impose further constraints, aligning features from an adversarial perspective. Through this alignment, the surrogate model is trained to concentrate on the common features extracted by the witness model. This facilitates adversarial attacks on these shared features, thereby yielding perturbations that exhibit enhanced transferability. Extensive experiments on various architectures on ImageNet show that aligned surrogate models based on SAA can provide higher transferable adversarial examples, especially in cross-architecture attacks.

- *Xiaoliang Liu, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao*

- `2411.02974v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02974v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02974v3)

> The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.

<summary>2025-01-02 03:14:11 - Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair</summary>

- *Junjielong Xu, Ying Fu, Shin Hwei Tan, Pinjia He*

- `2404.08877v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08877v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08877v4)

> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.   In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.

- *Linhao Huang, Xue Jiang, Zhiqiang Wang, Wentao Mo, Xi Xiao, Bo Han, Yongjie Yin, Feng Zheng*

- `2501.01042v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01042v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01042v1)

> Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models--a common and practical real world scenario--remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal model (IMM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and temporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. In addition, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rates of 55.48% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for VideoQA tasks, respectively. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<summary>2025-01-02 04:06:46 - BiasJailbreak:Analyzing Ethical Biases and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</summary>

- *Isack Lee, Haebin Seong*

- `2410.13334v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13334v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13334v3)

> Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in various tasks, they present potential safety risks, such as `jailbreaks', where malicious inputs can coerce LLMs into generating harmful content bypassing safety alignments. In this paper, we delve into the ethical biases in LLMs and examine how those biases could be exploited for jailbreaks. Notably, these biases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by 20\% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16\% between white and black keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We introduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by these safety-induced biases. BiasJailbreak generates biased keywords automatically by asking the target LLM itself, and utilizes the keywords to generate harmful output. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method BiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts prior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text generation. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually lead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more secure and unbiased. To enable further research and improvements, we open-source our code and artifacts of BiasJailbreak, providing the community with tools to better understand and mitigate safety-induced biases in LLMs.

- *Jamil Ispahany, MD Rafiqul Islam, M. Arif Khan, MD Zahidul Islam*

- `2501.01083v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01083v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01083v1)

> In response to the increasing ransomware threat, this study presents a novel detection system that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By leveraging Sysmon logs, the system enables real-time analysis on Windows-based endpoints. Our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional models by employing batch-based incremental learning, allowing the system to continuously adapt to new ransomware variants without requiring complete retraining. The proposed model achieved an impressive average F2-score of 99.61\%, with low false positive and false negative rates of 0.17\% and 4.69\%, respectively, within a highly imbalanced dataset. This demonstrates exceptional accuracy in identifying malicious behaviour. The dynamic detection capabilities of Sysmon enhance the model's effectiveness by providing a reliable stream of security events, mitigating the vulnerabilities associated with static detection methods. Furthermore, the parallel processing of LSTM modules, combined with attention mechanisms, significantly improves training efficiency and reduces latency, making our system well-suited for real-world applications. These findings underscore the potential of our CNN-LSTM framework as a robust solution for real-time ransomware detection, ensuring adaptability and resilience in the face of evolving cyber threats.

- `2501.01089v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01089v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01089v1)

> In the face of increasing cyber threats, particularly ransomware attacks, there is a pressing need for advanced detection and analysis systems that adapt to evolving malware behaviours. Throughout the literature, using machine learning (ML) to obviate ransomware attacks has increased in popularity. Unfortunately, most of these proposals leverage non-incremental learning approaches that require the underlying models to be updated from scratch to detect new ransomware, wasting time and resources. This approach is problematic because it leaves sensitive data vulnerable to attack during retraining, as newly emerging ransomware strains may go undetected until the model is updated. Furthermore, most of these approaches are not designed to detect ransomware in real-time data streams, limiting their effectiveness in complex network environments. To address this challenge, we present the Sysmon Incremental Learning System for Ransomware Analysis and Detection (SILRAD), which enables continuous updates to the underlying model and effectively closes the training gap. By leveraging the capabilities of Sysmon for detailed monitoring of system activities, our approach integrates online incremental learning techniques to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of ransomware detection. The most valuable features for detection were selected using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), and concept drift detection was implemented through the ADWIN algorithm, ensuring that the model remains responsive to changes in ransomware behaviour. We compared our results to other popular techniques, such as Hoeffding Trees (HT) and Leveraging Bagging Classifier (LB), observing a detection accuracy of 98.89% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) rate of 94.11%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our technique.

> Transferable adversarial examples highlight the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to imperceptible perturbations across various real-world applications. While there have been notable advancements in untargeted transferable attacks, targeted transferable attacks remain a significant challenge. In this work, we focus on generative approaches for targeted transferable attacks. Current generative attacks focus on reducing overfitting to surrogate models and the source data domain, but they often overlook the importance of enhancing transferability through additional semantics. To address this issue, we introduce a novel plug-and-play module into the general generator architecture to enhance adversarial transferability. Specifically, we propose a \emph{Semantic Injection Module} (SIM) that utilizes the semantics contained in an additional guiding image to improve transferability. The guiding image provides a simple yet effective method to incorporate target semantics from the target class to create targeted and highly transferable attacks. Additionally, we propose new loss formulations that can integrate the semantic injection module more effectively for both targeted and untargeted attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments under both targeted and untargeted attack settings to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.

> In recent years, a plethora of database management systems have surfaced to meet the demands of various scenarios. Emerging database systems, such as time-series and streaming database systems, are tailored to specific use cases requiring enhanced functionality and performance. However, as they are typically less mature, there can be bugs that either cause incorrect results or errors impacting reliability. To tackle this, we propose enhanced differential testing to uncover various bugs in emerging SQL-like database systems. The challenge is how to deal with differences of these emerging databases. Our insight is that many emerging database systems are conceptually extensions of relational database systems, making it possible to reveal logic bugs leveraging existing relational, known-reliable database systems. However, due to inevitable syntax or semantics gaps, it remains challenging to scale differential testing to various emerging database systems. We enhance differential testing for emerging database systems with three steps: (i) identifying shared clauses; (ii) extending shared clauses via mapping new features back to existing clauses of relational database systems; and (iii) generating differential inputs using extended shared clauses. We implemented our approach in a tool called SQLxDiff and applied it to four popular emerging database systems. In total, we found 57 unknown bugs, of which 17 were logic bugs and 40 were internal errors. Overall, vendors fixed 50 bugs and confirmed 5. Our results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of SQLxDiff in detecting bugs in emerging database systems, which has the potential to improve the reliability of their applications.

> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges. Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data. This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q. Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs. These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks. The example code and attack samples from our research are provided at https://github.com/Sensente/Security-Attacks-on-LCCTs.

> The increasing complexity of modern processor and IP designs presents significant challenges in identifying and mitigating hardware flaws early in the IC design cycle. Traditional hardware fuzzing techniques, inspired by software testing, have shown promise but face scalability issues, especially at the gate-level netlist where bugs introduced during synthesis are often missed by RTL-level verification due to longer simulation times.   To address this, we introduce GraphFuzz, a graph-based hardware fuzzer designed for gate-level netlist verification. In this approach, hardware designs are modeled as graph nodes, with gate behaviors encoded as features. By leveraging graph learning algorithms, GraphFuzz efficiently detects hardware vulnerabilities by analyzing node patterns. Our evaluation across benchmark circuits and open-source processors demonstrates an average prediction accuracy of 80% and bug detection accuracy of 70%, highlighting the potential of graph-based methods for enhancing hardware verification.

- `2501.01510v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01510v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01510v1)

> Brain age is the estimate of biological age derived from neuroimaging datasets using machine learning algorithms. Increasing \textit{brain age gap} characterized by an elevated brain age relative to the chronological age can reflect increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Hence, brain age gap is a promising biomarker for monitoring brain health. However, black-box machine learning approaches to brain age gap prediction have limited practical utility. Recent studies on coVariance neural networks (VNN) have proposed a relatively transparent deep learning pipeline for neuroimaging data analyses, which possesses two key features: (i) inherent \textit{anatomically interpretablity} of derived biomarkers; and (ii) a methodologically interpretable perspective based on \textit{linkage with eigenvectors of anatomic covariance matrix}. In this paper, we apply the VNN-based approach to study brain age gap using cortical thickness features for various prevalent neurodegenerative conditions. Our results reveal distinct anatomic patterns for brain age gap in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical Parkinsonian disorders. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distinct anatomic patterns of brain age gap are linked with the differences in how VNN leverages the eigenspectrum of the anatomic covariance matrix, thus lending explainability to the reported results.

> Wireless local area networks remain vulnerable to attacks initiated during the connection establishment (CE) phase. Current Wi-Fi security protocols fail to fully mitigate attacks like man-in-the-middle, preamble spoofing, and relaying. To fortify the CE phase, in this paper we design a backward-compatible scheme using a digital signature interwoven into the preambles at the physical (PHY) layer with time constraints to effectively counter those attacks. This approach slices a MAC-layer signature and embeds the slices within CE frame preambles without extending frame size, allowing one or multiple stations to concurrently verify their respective APs' transmissions. The concurrent CEs are supported by enabling the stations to analyze the consistent patterns of PHY-layer headers and identify whether the received frames are the anticipated ones from the expected APs, achieving 100% accuracy without needing to examine their MAC-layer headers. Additionally, we design and implement a fast relay attack to challenge our proposed defense and determine its effectiveness. We extend existing open-source tools to support IEEE 802.11ax to evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed scheme in a testbed consisting of USRPs, commercial APs, and Wi-Fi devices, and we show that our relay attack detection achieves 96-100% true positive rates. Finally, end-to-end formal security analyses confirm the security and correctness of the proposed solution.

> Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are often criticized for their inherent bias and for their lack of control, accountability, and transparency. Consequently, regulatory bodies struggle with containing this technology's potential negative side effects. High-level requirements such as fairness and robustness need to be formalized into concrete specification metrics, imperfect proxies that capture isolated aspects of the underlying requirements. Given possible trade-offs between different metrics and their vulnerability to over-optimization, integrating specification metrics in system development processes is not trivial. This paper defines specification overfitting, a scenario where systems focus excessively on specified metrics to the detriment of high-level requirements and task performance. We present an extensive literature survey to categorize how researchers propose, measure, and optimize specification metrics in several AI fields (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning). Using a keyword-based search on papers from major AI conferences and journals between 2018 and mid-2023, we identify and analyze 74 papers that propose or optimize specification metrics. We find that although most papers implicitly address specification overfitting (e.g., by reporting more than one specification metric), they rarely discuss which role specification metrics should play in system development or explicitly define the scope and assumptions behind metric formulations.

> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly relied on in AI systems, predicting when they make mistakes is crucial. While a great deal of work in the field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these representations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an API. In this paper, we extract features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using follow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as representations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. We demonstrate that training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces reliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance level (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question). Remarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate over a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In addition, we demonstrate that these extracted features can be used to evaluate more nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be used to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that has been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers question-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code. Furthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model architectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of GPT-4o-mini).

- `2402.01369v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01369v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01369v2)

> Diffusion models have been widely deployed in various image generation tasks, demonstrating an extraordinary connection between image and text modalities. Although prior studies have explored the vulnerability of diffusion models from the perspectives of text and image modalities separately, the current research landscape has not yet thoroughly investigated the vulnerabilities that arise from the integration of multiple modalities, specifically through the joint analysis of textual and visual features. In this paper, we are the first to visualize both text and image feature space embedded by diffusion models and observe a significant difference. The prompts are embedded chaotically in the text feature space, while in the image feature space they are clustered according to their subjects. These fascinating findings may underscore a potential misalignment in robustness between the two modalities that exists within diffusion models. Based on this observation, we propose MMP-Attack, which leverages multi-modal priors (MMP) to manipulate the generation results of diffusion models by appending a specific suffix to the original prompt. Specifically, our goal is to induce diffusion models to generate a specific object while simultaneously eliminating the original object. Our MMP-Attack shows a notable advantage over existing studies with superior manipulation capability and efficiency. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ydc123/MMP-Attack}.

> Cross-lingual entity alignment (EA) enables the integration of multiple knowledge graphs (KGs) across different languages, providing users with seamless access to diverse and comprehensive knowledge. Existing methods, mostly supervised, face challenges in obtaining labeled entity pairs. To address this, recent studies have shifted towards self-supervised and unsupervised frameworks. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches have limitations: (1) Relation passing: mainly focusing on the entity while neglecting the semantic information of relations, (2) Isomorphic assumption: assuming isomorphism between source and target graphs, which leads to noise and reduced alignment accuracy, and (3) Noise vulnerability: susceptible to noise in the textual features, especially when encountering inconsistent translations or Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. In this paper, we propose ERAlign, an unsupervised and robust cross-lingual EA pipeline that jointly performs Entity-level and Relation-level Alignment by neighbor triple matching strategy using semantic textual features of relations and entities. Its refinement step iteratively enhances results by fusing entity-level and relation-level alignments based on neighbor triple matching. The additional verification step examines the entities' neighbor triples as the linearized text. This Align-then-Verify pipeline rigorously assesses alignment results, achieving near-perfect alignment even in the presence of noisy textual features of entities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness and general applicability of ERAlign improved the accuracy and effectiveness of EA tasks, contributing significantly to knowledge-oriented applications.

> The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in various domains has led to operational advancements, but it has also introduced new vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats, as evidenced by recent widespread cyberattacks on IoT devices. Intrusion detection systems are often reactive, triggered by specific patterns or anomalies observed within the network. To address this challenge, this work proposes a proactive approach to anticipate and preemptively mitigate malicious activities, aiming to prevent potential damage before it occurs. This paper proposes an innovative intrusion prediction framework empowered by Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework incorporates two LLMs: a fine-tuned Bidirectional and AutoRegressive Transformers (BART) model for predicting network traffic and a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for evaluating the predicted traffic. By harnessing the bidirectional capabilities of BART the framework then identifies malicious packets among these predictions. Evaluated using the CICIoT2023 IoT attack dataset, our framework showcases a notable enhancement in predictive performance, attaining an impressive 98% overall accuracy, providing a powerful response to the cybersecurity challenges that confront IoT networks.

- `2501.02029v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02029v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02029v1)

> With the integration of an additional modality, large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit greater vulnerability to safety risks (e.g., jailbreaking) compared to their language-only predecessors. Although recent studies have devoted considerable effort to the post-hoc alignment of LVLMs, the inner safety mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we discover that internal activations of LVLMs during the first token generation can effectively identify malicious prompts across different attacks. This inherent safety perception is governed by sparse attention heads, which we term ``safety heads." Further analysis reveals that these heads act as specialized shields against malicious prompts; ablating them leads to higher attack success rates, while the model's utility remains unaffected. By locating these safety heads and concatenating their activations, we construct a straightforward but powerful malicious prompt detector that integrates seamlessly into the generation process with minimal extra inference overhead. Despite its simple structure of a logistic regression model, the detector surprisingly exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. Experiments across various prompt-based attacks confirm the effectiveness of leveraging safety heads to protect LVLMs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Ziwei-Zheng/SAHs}.

- `2412.05934v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05934v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05934v2)

> With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), concerns regarding their security have increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, designing effective multimodal jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given the distinct protective measures implemented across various modalities in commercial models. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting in limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy and heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution strategy is used to segment harmful instructions across multiple modalities to effectively circumvent MLLMs' security protection. The heuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the understanding-enhancing prompt, which helps the MLLM reconstruct the malicious prompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative outputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively uncovers vulnerabilities in MLLMs, achieving an average attack success rate of 90% across seven popular open-source MLLMs and an average attack success rate of around 68% in three popular closed-source MLLMs. Our code will coming soon. Warning: This paper contains offensive and harmful examples, reader discretion is advised.

- `2501.01830v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01830v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01830v1)

> Automated red-teaming has become a crucial approach for uncovering vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, most existing methods focus on isolated safety flaws, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic defenses and uncover complex vulnerabilities efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose Auto-RT, a reinforcement learning framework that automatically explores and optimizes complex attack strategies to effectively uncover security vulnerabilities through malicious queries. Specifically, we introduce two key mechanisms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization: 1) Early-terminated Exploration, which accelerate exploration by focusing on high-potential attack strategies; and 2) Progressive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate downgrade models, which dynamically refine the search trajectory toward successful vulnerability exploitation. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that, by significantly improving exploration efficiency and automatically optimizing attack strategies, Auto-RT detects a boarder range of vulnerabilities, achieving a faster detection speed and 16.63\% higher success rates compared to existing methods.

> Despite significant efforts to align large language models with human values and ethical guidelines, these models remain susceptible to sophisticated jailbreak attacks that exploit their reasoning capabilities. Traditional safety mechanisms often focus on detecting explicit malicious intent, leaving deeper vulnerabilities unaddressed. In this work, we introduce a jailbreak technique, POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), which leverages contrastive reasoning to elicit unethical responses. POATE generates prompts with semantically opposite intents and combines them with adversarial templates to subtly direct models toward producing harmful responses. We conduct extensive evaluations across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes, including LLaMA3, Gemma2, Phi3, and GPT-4, to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. We evaluate our proposed attack against seven safety defenses, revealing their limitations in addressing reasoning-based vulnerabilities. To counteract this, we propose a defense strategy that improves reasoning robustness through chain-of-thought prompting and reverse thinking, mitigating reasoning-driven adversarial exploits.

- *Christopher Burger, Charles Walter, Thai Le, Lingwei Chen*

- `2501.02042v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02042v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02042v1)

> Recent work has investigated the concept of adversarial attacks on explainable AI (XAI) in the NLP domain with a focus on examining the vulnerability of local surrogate methods such as Lime to adversarial perturbations or small changes on the input of a machine learning (ML) model. In such attacks, the generated explanation is manipulated while the meaning and structure of the original input remain similar under the ML model. Such attacks are especially alarming when XAI is used as a basis for decision making (e.g., prescribing drugs based on AI medical predictors) or for legal action (e.g., legal dispute involving AI software). Although weaknesses across many XAI methods have been shown to exist, the reasons behind why remain little explored. Central to this XAI manipulation is the similarity measure used to calculate how one explanation differs from another. A poor choice of similarity measure can lead to erroneous conclusions about the stability or adversarial robustness of an XAI method. Therefore, this work investigates a variety of similarity measures designed for text-based ranked lists referenced in related work to determine their comparative suitability for use. We find that many measures are overly sensitive, resulting in erroneous estimates of stability. We then propose a weighting scheme for text-based data that incorporates the synonymity between the features within an explanation, providing more accurate estimates of the actual weakness of XAI methods to adversarial examples.

> Logic locking has emerged to prevent piracy and overproduction of integrated circuits ever since the split of the design house and manufacturing foundry was established. While there has been a lot of research using a single global key to lock the circuit, even the most sophisticated single-key locking methods have been shown to be vulnerable to powerful SAT-based oracle-guided attacks that can extract the correct key with the help of an activated chip bought off the market and the locked netlist leaked from the untrusted foundry. To address this challenge, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel logic locking method called K-Gate Lock that encodes input patterns using multiple keys that are applied to one set of key inputs at different operational times. Our comprehensive experimental results confirm that using multiple keys will make the circuit secure against oracle-guided attacks and increase attacker efforts to an exponentially time-consuming brute force search. K-Gate Lock has reasonable power and performance overheads, making it a practical solution for real-world hardware intellectual property protection.

> This paper investigates the resilience of a ResNet-50 image classification model under two prominent security threats: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attacks and malicious payload injection. Initially, the model attains a 53.33% accuracy on clean images. When subjected to FGSM perturbations, its overall accuracy remains unchanged; however, the model's confidence in incorrect predictions notably increases. Concurrently, a payload injection scheme is successfully executed in 93.33% of the tested samples, revealing how stealthy attacks can manipulate model predictions without degrading visual quality. These findings underscore the vulnerability of even high-performing neural networks and highlight the urgency of developing more robust defense mechanisms for security-critical applications.

> Verisign reported a 125 percent increase in data breaches within the healthcare sector in the United States during 2022, with 18.2 million patient records being impacted. Growing healthcare data volumes and diversification mean that medical information is becoming more valuable. Many Health Centers use various technologies to ease the classification, storage, and exchange of big data. This use can also make the health data of the users at risk and vulnerable. AI and blockchain are among the leading technologies at hand. With AI, data-driven operations and big data efficiency have been improved with respect to traditional techniques. Due to its potential to bring about improvements in health services and lower medical costs, this AI technology is regularly used in healthcare. Blockchain helps protect transactions on sharing information and private privacy as long as the exchange of knowledge is that of the standard. The objective of this analysis is to investigate the research and unique contributions since 2008 regarding blockchain-integrated AI and healthcare systems. The work sheds light on applied AI-based healthcare schemes with machine, ballistic, and acrylic learning and disparate blockchain structures. The use of technology in order to ensure patient data security and manage medical information effectively in healthcare settings offers a highly successful position for both healthcare providers and patients. From 2018 to 2021, the best year was 2021 to grow, enhancing everything to examine the download of the device and the counting of Google Academies, for which the joining perspective was borrowed; local research experts were asked, identified articles in recent years, and read reviews of large research grants.

- `2110.14068v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14068v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14068v4)

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., an imperceptible perturbation to the input can mislead DNNs trained on clean images into making erroneous predictions. To tackle this, adversarial training is currently the most effective defense method, by augmenting the training set with adversarial samples generated on the fly. Interestingly, we discover for the first time that there exist subnetworks with inborn robustness, matching or surpassing the robust accuracy of the adversarially trained networks with comparable model sizes, within randomly initialized networks without any model training, indicating that adversarial training on model weights is not indispensable towards adversarial robustness. We name such subnetworks Robust Scratch Tickets (RSTs), which are also by nature efficient. Distinct from the popular lottery ticket hypothesis, neither the original dense networks nor the identified RSTs need to be trained. To validate and understand this fascinating finding, we further conduct extensive experiments to study the existence and properties of RSTs under different models, datasets, sparsity patterns, and attacks, drawing insights regarding the relationship between DNNs' robustness and their initialization/overparameterization. Furthermore, we identify the poor adversarial transferability between RSTs of different sparsity ratios drawn from the same randomly initialized dense network, and propose a Random RST Switch (R2S) technique, which randomly switches between different RSTs, as a novel defense method built on top of RSTs. We believe our findings about RSTs have opened up a new perspective to study model robustness and extend the lottery ticket hypothesis.

> The recent breakthroughs of deep neural networks (DNNs) and the advent of billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have excited an explosive demand for intelligent IoT devices equipped with domain-specific DNN accelerators. However, the deployment of DNN accelerator enabled intelligent functionality into real-world IoT devices still remains particularly challenging. First, powerful DNNs often come at prohibitive complexities, whereas IoT devices often suffer from stringent resource constraints. Second, while DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks especially on IoT devices exposed to complex real-world environments, many IoT applications require strict security. Existing DNN accelerators mostly tackle only one of the two aforementioned challenges (i.e., efficiency or adversarial robustness) while neglecting or even sacrificing the other. To this end, we propose a 2-in-1 Accelerator, an integrated algorithm-accelerator co-design framework aiming at winning both the adversarial robustness and efficiency of DNN accelerators. Specifically, we first propose a Random Precision Switch (RPS) algorithm that can effectively defend DNNs against adversarial attacks by enabling random DNN quantization as an in-situ model switch. Furthermore, we propose a new precision-scalable accelerator featuring (1) a new precision-scalable MAC unit architecture which spatially tiles the temporal MAC units to boost both the achievable efficiency and flexibility and (2) a systematically optimized dataflow that is searched by our generic accelerator optimizer. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that our 2-in-1 Accelerator can not only aggressively boost both the adversarial robustness and efficiency of DNN accelerators under various attacks, but also naturally support instantaneous robustness-efficiency trade-offs adapting to varied resources without the necessity of DNN retraining.

> Many recent IT companies use cloud services for deploying their products, mainly because of their convenience. As such, cloud assets have become a new attack surface, and the concept of cloud security has emerged. However, cloud security is not emphasized enough compared to on-premise security, resulting in many insecure cloud architectures. In particular, small organizations often don't have enough human resources to design a secure architecture, leaving them vulnerable to cloud security breaches.   We suggest the multi-account strategy for securing the cloud architecture. This strategy cost-effectively improves security by separating assets and reducing management overheads on the cloud infrastructure. When implemented, it automatically provides access restriction within the boundary of an account and eliminates redundancies in policy management. Since access control is a critical objective for constructing secure architectures, this practical method successfully enhances security even in small companies.   In this paper, we analyze the benefits of multi-accounts compared to single accounts and explain how to deploy multiple accounts effortlessly using the services provided by AWS. Then, we present possible design choices for multi-account structures with a concrete example. Finally, we illustrate two techniques for operational excellence on multi-account structures. We take an incremental approach to secure policy management with the principle of least privilege and introduce methods for auditing multiple accounts.

> As blockchain technology and smart contracts become widely adopted, securing them throughout every stage of the transaction process is essential. The concern of improved security for smart contracts is to find and detect vulnerabilities using classical Machine Learning (ML) models and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLM). The robustness of such work rests on a labeled smart contract dataset that includes annotated vulnerabilities on which several LLMs alongside various traditional machine learning algorithms such as DistilBERT model is trained and tested. We train and test machine learning algorithms to classify smart contract codes according to vulnerability types in order to compare model performance. Having fine-tuned the LLMs specifically for smart contract code classification should help in getting better results when detecting several types of well-known vulnerabilities, such as Reentrancy, Integer Overflow, Timestamp Dependency and Dangerous Delegatecall. From our initial experimental results, it can be seen that our fine-tuned LLM surpasses the accuracy of any other model by achieving an accuracy of over 90%, and this advances the existing vulnerability detection benchmarks. Such performance provides a great deal of evidence for LLMs ability to describe the subtle patterns in the code that traditional ML models could miss. Thus, we compared each of the ML and LLM models to give a good overview of each models strengths, from which we can choose the most effective one for real-world applications in smart contract security. Our research combines machine learning and large language models to provide a rich and interpretable framework for detecting different smart contract vulnerabilities, which lays a foundation for a more secure blockchain ecosystem.

> Large Language Models (LLMs), which bridge the gap between human language understanding and complex problem-solving, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings. Despite the demonstrable efficacy of LLMs, due to constraints on computational resources, users have to engage with open-source language models or outsource the entire training process to third-party platforms. However, research has demonstrated that language models are susceptible to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into language models by poisoning training samples or model weights, allowing attackers to manipulate model responses through malicious triggers. While existing surveys on backdoor attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they lack an in-depth examination of backdoor attacks specifically targeting LLMs. To bridge this gap and grasp the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a novel perspective on backdoor attacks for LLMs by focusing on fine-tuning methods. Specifically, we systematically classify backdoor attacks into three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and no fine-tuning Based on insights from a substantial review, we also discuss crucial issues for future research on backdoor attacks, such as further exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning, or developing more covert attack algorithms.

> The increasing reliance on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), particularly the Global Positioning System (GPS), underscores the urgent need to safeguard these technologies against malicious threats such as spoofing and jamming. As the backbone for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) across various applications including transportation, telecommunications, and emergency services GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference that poses significant risks. Spoofing attacks, which involve transmitting counterfeit GNSS signals to mislead receivers into calculating incorrect positions, can result in serious consequences, from navigational errors in civilian aviation to security breaches in military operations. Furthermore, the lack of inherent security measures within GNSS systems makes them attractive targets for adversaries. While GNSS/GPS jamming and spoofing systems consist of numerous components, the ability to distinguish authentic signals from malicious ones is essential for maintaining system integrity. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning provide promising avenues for enhancing detection and mitigation strategies against these threats. This paper addresses both spoofing and jamming by tackling real-world challenges through machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets related to spoofing and jamming detection using advanced algorithms, we achieved state of the art results. In the GNSS/GPS jamming detection task, we attained approximately 99% accuracy, improving performance by around 5% compared to previous studies. Additionally, we addressed a challenging tasks related to spoofing detection, yielding results that underscore the potential of machine learning and deep learning in this domain.

> Task arithmetic in large-scale pre-trained models enables flexible adaptation to diverse downstream tasks without extensive re-training. By leveraging task vectors (TVs), users can perform modular updates to pre-trained models through simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. However, this flexibility introduces new security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we identify and evaluate the susceptibility of TVs to backdoor attacks, demonstrating how malicious actors can exploit TVs to compromise model integrity. By developing composite backdoors and eliminating redudant clean tasks, we introduce BadTV, a novel backdoor attack specifically designed to remain effective under task learning, forgetting, and analogies operations. Our extensive experiments reveal that BadTV achieves near-perfect attack success rates across various scenarios, significantly impacting the security of models using task arithmetic. We also explore existing defenses, showing that current methods fail to detect or mitigate BadTV. Our findings highlight the need for robust defense mechanisms to secure TVs in real-world applications, especially as TV services become more popular in machine-learning ecosystems.

> Supervised fine-tuning has become the predominant method for adapting large pretrained models to downstream tasks. However, recent studies have revealed that these models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where even a small number of malicious samples can successfully embed backdoor triggers into the model. While most existing defense methods focus on post-training backdoor defense, efficiently defending against backdoor attacks during training phase remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel defense method called Backdoor Token Unlearning (BTU), which proactively detects and neutralizes trigger tokens during the training stage. Our work is based on two key findings: 1) backdoor learning causes distinctive differences between backdoor token parameters and clean token parameters in word embedding layers, and 2) the success of backdoor attacks heavily depends on backdoor token parameters. The BTU defense leverages these properties to identify aberrant embedding parameters and subsequently removes backdoor behaviors using a fine-grained unlearning technique. Extensive evaluations across three datasets and four types of backdoor attacks demonstrate that BTU effectively defends against these threats while preserving the model's performance on primary tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/XDJPH/BTU.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating harmful content when prompted with carefully crafted inputs, a vulnerability known as LLM jailbreaking. As LLMs become more powerful, studying jailbreak methods is critical to enhancing security and aligning models with human values. Traditionally, jailbreak techniques have relied on suffix addition or prompt templates, but these methods suffer from limited attack diversity. This paper introduces DiffusionAttacker, an end-to-end generative approach for jailbreak rewriting inspired by diffusion models. Our method employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text diffusion model as a generator, conditioning on the original prompt and guiding the denoising process with a novel attack loss. Unlike previous approaches that use autoregressive LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts, which limit the modification of already generated tokens and restrict the rewriting space, DiffusionAttacker utilizes a seq2seq diffusion model, allowing more flexible token modifications. This approach preserves the semantic content of the original prompt while producing harmful content. Additionally, we leverage the Gumbel-Softmax technique to make the sampling process from the diffusion model's output distribution differentiable, eliminating the need for iterative token search. Extensive experiments on Advbench and Harmbench demonstrate that DiffusionAttacker outperforms previous methods across various evaluation metrics, including attack success rate (ASR), fluency, and diversity.

> The rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices into enterprise environments presents significant security challenges. Many IoT devices are released to the market with minimal security measures, often harbouring an average of 25 vulnerabilities per device. To enhance cybersecurity measures and aid system administrators in managing IoT patches more effectively, we propose an innovative framework that predicts the time it will take for a vulnerable IoT device to receive a fix or patch. We developed a survival analysis model based on the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) approach, implemented using the XGBoost ensemble regression model, to predict when vulnerable IoT devices will receive fixes or patches. By constructing a comprehensive IoT vulnerabilities database that combines public and private sources, we provide insights into affected devices, vulnerability detection dates, published CVEs, patch release dates, and associated Twitter activity trends. We conducted thorough experiments evaluating different combinations of features, including fundamental device and vulnerability data, National Vulnerability Database (NVD) information such as CVE, CWE, and CVSS scores, transformed textual descriptions into sentence vectors, and the frequency of Twitter trends related to CVEs. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts the time to fix for IoT vulnerabilities, with data from VulDB and NVD proving particularly effective. Incorporating Twitter trend data offered minimal additional benefit. This framework provides a practical tool for organisations to anticipate vulnerability resolutions, improve IoT patch management, and strengthen their cybersecurity posture against potential threats.

> Code vulnerability detection (CVD) is essential for addressing and preventing system security issues, playing a crucial role in ensuring software security. Previous learning-based vulnerability detection methods rely on either fine-tuning medium-size sequence models or training smaller neural networks from scratch. Recent advancements in large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in various code intelligence tasks including code understanding and generation. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting code vulnerabilities is largely under-explored. This work aims to investigate the gap by fine-tuning LLMs for the CVD task, involving four widely-used open-source LLMs. We also implement other five previous graph-based or medium-size sequence models for comparison. Experiments are conducted on five commonly-used CVD datasets, including both the part of short samples and long samples. In addition, we conduct quantitative experiments to investigate the class imbalance issue and the model's performance on samples of different lengths, which are rarely studied in previous works. To better facilitate communities, we open-source all codes and resources of this study in https://github.com/SakiRinn/LLM4CVD and https://huggingface.co/datasets/xuefen/VulResource.

> A critical part of creating code suggestion systems is the pre-training of Large Language Models on vast amounts of source code and natural language text, often of questionable origin or quality. This may contribute to the presence of bugs and vulnerabilities in code generated by LLMs. While efforts to identify bugs at or after code generation exist, it is preferable to pre-train or fine-tune LLMs on curated, high-quality, and compliant datasets. The need for vast amounts of training data necessitates that such curation be automated, minimizing human intervention.   We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the complete version history of open-source software projects to improve the quality of training data. This approach leverages the version history of all OSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have undergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples that include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities. We evaluate this method using The Stack v2 dataset, and find that 17% of the code versions in the dataset have newer versions, with 17% of those representing bug fixes, including 2.36% addressing known CVEs. The deduplicated version of Stack v2 still includes blobs vulnerable to 6,947 known CVEs. Furthermore, 58% of the blobs in the dataset were never modified after creation, suggesting they likely represent software with minimal or no use. Misidentified blob origins present an additional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively licensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.   By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations. We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.

> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, including chatbot assistants and code generation, aligning their behavior with safety and ethical standards has become paramount. However, jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to elicit unintended or harmful outputs, threaten LLMs' safety significantly. In this paper, we introduce Layer-AdvPatcher, a novel methodology designed to defend against jailbreak attacks by utilizing an unlearning strategy to patch specific layers within LLMs through self-augmented datasets. Our insight is that certain layer(s), tend to produce affirmative tokens when faced with harmful prompts. By identifying these layers and adversarially exposing them to generate more harmful data, one can understand their inherent and diverse vulnerabilities to attacks. With these exposures, we then "unlearn" these issues, reducing the impact of affirmative tokens and hence minimizing jailbreak risks while keeping the model's responses to safe queries intact. We conduct extensive experiments on two models, four benchmark datasets, and multiple state-of-the-art jailbreak benchmarks to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Results indicate that our framework reduces the harmfulness and attack success rate of jailbreak attacks without compromising utility for benign queries compared to recent defense methods.

> vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks. While various defence mechanisms have been proposed, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate these defences across diverse datasets, models, and tasks. In this work, we address this gap by presenting an extensive benchmark for textual adversarial defence that significantly expands upon previous work. Our benchmark incorporates a wide range of datasets, evaluates state-of-the-art defence mechanisms, and extends the assessment to include critical tasks such as single-sentence classification, similarity and paraphrase identification, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. This work not only serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of adversarial robustness but also identifies key areas for future research in textual adversarial defence. By establishing a new standard for benchmarking in this domain, we aim to accelerate progress towards more robust and reliable natural language processing systems.

> In a Proof-of-Work blockchain such as Bitcoin mining hashrate is increasing in the block reward. An increase in hashrate reduces network vulnerability to attack (a reduction in security cost) while increasing carbon emissions and electricity cost (an increase in externalities cost). This implies a tradeoff in total cost at different levels of hashrate and the existence of a hashrate interval where total cost is minimized. Targeted Nakamoto is a Proof-of-Work protocol augmentation that incentivizes miners to hone in on a target hashrate interval. When hashrate is above target a ceiling is placed on the block reward a miner can receive. When hashrate is below target a floor is placed underneath the miner's block reward. Monetary neutrality is maintained by a proportional increase in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match a deduction from total block reward when the ceiling is operative and a proportional reduction in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match an increase over the total block reward when the floor is binding.

> In recent years, attention-based models have excelled across various domains but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, often from downloading or fine-tuning on poisoned datasets. Many current methods to mitigate backdoors in NLP models rely on the pre-trained (unfine-tuned) weights, but these methods fail in scenarios where the pre-trained weights are not available. In this work, we propose MBTSAD, which can mitigate backdoors in the language model by utilizing only a small subset of clean data and does not require pre-trained weights. Specifically, MBTSAD retrains the backdoored model on a dataset generated by token splitting. Then MBTSAD leverages attention distillation, the retrained model is the teacher model, and the original backdoored model is the student model. Experimental results demonstrate that MBTSAD achieves comparable backdoor mitigation performance as the methods based on pre-trained weights while maintaining the performance on clean data. MBTSAD does not rely on pre-trained weights, enhancing its utility in scenarios where pre-trained weights are inaccessible. In addition, we simplify the min-max problem of adversarial training and visualize text representations to discover that the token splitting method in MBTSAD's first step generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading the model to learn more generalized features and eliminate backdoor patterns.

> The Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system has become a standard feature in recent car models. While marketed as providing auto-steering capabilities, the system's operational characteristics and safety performance remain underexplored, primarily due to a lack of real-world testing and comprehensive data. To fill this gap, we extensively tested mainstream LKA systems from leading U.S. automakers in Tampa, Florida. Using an innovative method, we collected a comprehensive dataset that includes full Controller Area Network (CAN) messages with LKA attributes, as well as video, perception, and lateral trajectory data from a high-quality front-facing camera equipped with advanced vision detection and trajectory planning algorithms. Our tests spanned diverse, challenging conditions, including complex road geometry, adverse weather, degraded lane markings, and their combinations. A vision language model (VLM) further annotated the videos to capture weather, lighting, and traffic features. Based on this dataset, we present an empirical overview of LKA's operational features and safety performance. Key findings indicate: (i) LKA is vulnerable to faint markings and low pavement contrast; (ii) it struggles in lane transitions (merges, diverges, intersections), often causing unintended departures or disengagements; (iii) steering torque limitations lead to frequent deviations on sharp turns, posing safety risks; and (iv) LKA systems consistently maintain rigid lane-centering, lacking adaptability on tight curves or near large vehicles such as trucks. We conclude by demonstrating how this dataset can guide both infrastructure planning and self-driving technology. In view of LKA's limitations, we recommend improvements in road geometry and pavement maintenance. Additionally, we illustrate how the dataset supports the development of human-like LKA systems via VLM fine-tuning and Chain of Thought reasoning.

> As a cornerstone of blockchain technology in the 3.0 era, smart contracts play a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchain systems. In order to address the limitations of existing smart contract vulnerability detection models with regard to their generalisation capability, an AF-STip smart contract vulnerability detection framework incorporating efficient knowledge migration is proposed. AF-STip employs the teacher network as the main model and migrates the knowledge processed by the smart contract to the student model using a data-free knowledge distillation method. The student model utilises this knowledge to enhance its vulnerability detection capabilities. The approach markedly enhances the model's capacity for feature extraction and cross-class adaptation, while concurrently reducing computational overhead.In order to further enhance the extraction of vulnerability features, an adaptive fusion module is proposed in this paper, which aims to strengthen the interaction and fusion of feature information.The experimental results demonstrate that the STip model attains an average F1 value detection score of 91.16% for the four vulnerabilities without disclosing the original smart contract data. To validate the viability of the proposed lightweight migration approach, the student model is deployed in a migration learning task targeting a novel vulnerability type, resulting in an accuracy of 91.02% and an F1 score of 90.46%. To the best of our knowledge, AF-STip is the inaugural model to apply data-free knowledge migration to smart contract vulnerability detection. While markedly reducing the computational overhead, the method still demonstrates exceptional performance in detecting novel vulnerabilities.

> Machine learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers manipulate model behavior through data tampering or architectural modifications. Traditional backdoor attacks involve injecting malicious samples with specific triggers into the training data, causing the model to produce targeted incorrect outputs in the presence of the corresponding triggers. More sophisticated attacks modify the model's architecture directly, embedding backdoors that are harder to detect as they evade traditional data-based detection methods. However, the drawback of the architectural modification based backdoor attacks is that the trigger must be visible in order to activate the backdoor. To further strengthen the invisibility of the backdoor attacks, a novel backdoor attack method is presented in the paper. To be more specific, this method embeds the backdoor within the model's architecture and has the capability to generate inconspicuous and stealthy triggers. The attack is implemented by modifying pre-trained models, which are then redistributed, thereby posing a potential threat to unsuspecting users. Comprehensive experiments conducted on standard computer vision benchmarks validate the effectiveness of this attack and highlight the stealthiness of its triggers, which remain undetectable through both manual visual inspection and advanced detection tools.

> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been gaining a lot of interest due to their adaptability and extensibility in emerging applications, including communication networks. It is anticipated that ZSM networks will be able to support LLMs as a service, as they provide ultra reliable low-latency communications and closed loop massive connectivity. However, LLMs are vulnerable to data and model privacy issues that affect the trustworthiness of LLMs to be deployed for user-based services. In this paper, we explore the security vulnerabilities associated with fine-tuning LLMs in ZSM networks, in particular the membership inference attack. We define the characteristics of an attack network that can perform a membership inference attack if the attacker has access to the fine-tuned model for the downstream task. We show that the membership inference attacks are effective for any downstream task, which can lead to a personal data breach when using LLM as a service. The experimental results show that the attack success rate of maximum 92% can be achieved on named entity recognition task. Based on the experimental analysis, we discuss possible defense mechanisms and present possible research directions to make the LLMs more trustworthy in the context of ZSM networks.

> To preserve user privacy in recommender systems, federated recommendation (FR) based on federated learning (FL) emerges, keeping the personal data on the local client and updating a model collaboratively. Unlike FL, FR has a unique sparse aggregation mechanism, where the embedding of each item is updated by only partial clients, instead of full clients in a dense aggregation of general FL. Recently, as an essential principle of FL, model security has received increasing attention, especially for Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients can send arbitrary updates. The problem of exploring the Byzantine robustness of FR is particularly critical since in the domains applying FR, e.g., e-commerce, malicious clients can be injected easily by registering new accounts. However, existing Byzantine works neglect the unique sparse aggregation of FR, making them unsuitable for our problem. Thus, we make the first effort to investigate Byzantine attacks on FR from the perspective of sparse aggregation, which is non-trivial: it is not clear how to define Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregations and design Byzantine attacks under limited knowledge/capability. In this paper, we reformulate the Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregation by defining the aggregation for a single item as the smallest execution unit. Then we propose a family of effective attack strategies, named Spattack, which exploit the vulnerability in sparse aggregation and are categorized along the adversary's knowledge and capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Spattack can effectively prevent convergence and even break down defenses under a few malicious clients, raising alarms for securing FR systems.

> Augmented/Mixed Reality (AR/MR) technologies usher in a new era of immersive, collective experiences, distinctly differentiating them from traditional mobile systems. As these technologies evolve, prioritizing privacy and security is critical. This paper centers on gait privacy, a distinctive biometric vulnerable to revealing sensitive data. We introduce GaitGuard, a real-time system to safeguard gait privacy within MR environments. GaitGuard leverages a multi-threaded framework to efficiently process video frames, incorporating dedicated modules for stream capture, body detection and tracking, and privacy mitigation. This study includes a user analysis involving 20 participants to evaluate the risk of gait information exposure captured by video feeds in MR devices. Through thorough examination, we provide a comparative assessment of different mitigation techniques, analyzing their impact on privacy, video quality, and system efficiency. Our results indicate that GaitGuard significantly diminishes identification risks by up to $68\%$, while sustaining a robust streaming frame rate of $29$ FPS and preserving video clarity. GaitGuard offers a real-time approach to support privacy in MR applications, delivering a holistic solution to mitigate gait information exposure without affecting user experience.

However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

However, the isolated nature of blockchain ecosystems hinders the seamless transfer of digital assets across different chains. Cross-chain bridges have emerged as vital web3 infrastructure to address this challenge by facilitating interoperability between distinct blockchains. Cross-chain bridges remain vulnerable to various attacks despite sophisticated designs and security measures. The industry has experienced a surge in bridge attacks, resulting in significant financial losses. The largest hack impacted Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge, with a loss of almost \$600 million USD. This paper analyzes recent cross-chain bridge hacks in 2022 and 2023 and examines the exploited vulnerabilities. By understanding the attack nature and underlying weaknesses, the paper aims to enhance bridge security and propose potential countermeasures. The findings contribute to developing industry-wide standards for bridge security and operational resilience.

> Software vulnerabilities continue to be ubiquitous, even in the era of AI-powered code assistants, advanced static analysis tools, and the adoption of extensive testing frameworks. It has become apparent that we must not simply prevent these bugs, but also eliminate them in a quick, efficient manner. Yet, human code intervention is slow, costly, and can often lead to further security vulnerabilities, especially in legacy codebases.

> The widespread adoption of deep learning across various industries has introduced substantial challenges, particularly in terms of model explainability and security. The inherent complexity of deep learning models, while contributing to their effectiveness, also renders them susceptible to adversarial attacks. Among these, backdoor attacks are especially concerning, as they involve surreptitiously embedding specific triggers within training data, causing the model to exhibit aberrant behavior when presented with input containing the triggers. Such attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in outsourced processes, compromising model integrity without affecting performance on clean (trigger-free) input data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies designed to counter backdoor attacks in image recognition. We provide an in-depth analysis of the theoretical foundations, practical efficacy, and limitations of these approaches. In addition, we conduct an extensive benchmarking of sixteen state-of-the-art approaches against eight distinct backdoor attacks, utilizing three datasets, four model architectures, and three poisoning ratios. Our results, derived from 122,236 individual experiments, indicate that while many approaches provide some level of protection, their performance can vary considerably. Furthermore, when compared to two seminal approaches, most newer approaches do not demonstrate substantial improvements in overall performance or consistency across diverse settings. Drawing from these findings, we propose potential directions for developing more effective and generalizable defensive mechanisms in the future.

> Protecting the copyright of large language models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their resource-intensive training and accompanying carefully designed licenses. However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challenging due to potential parameter alterations. In this study, we introduce HuRef, a human-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base model without interfering with training or exposing model parameters to the public. We first observe that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after the model has converged during pretraining, with negligible perturbations through subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient condition to identify the base model. The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM with an extra term to drive away the model parameters' direction and the model becomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks like dimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it without affecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure, we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant terms that identify an LLM's base model. Due to the potential risk of information leakage, we cannot publish invariant terms directly. Instead, we map them to a Gaussian vector using an encoder, then convert it into a natural image using StyleGAN2, and finally publish the image. In our black-box setting, all fingerprinting steps are internally conducted by the LLMs owners. To ensure the published fingerprints are honestly generated, we introduced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/HuRef.

- *Fengqing Jiang, Zhangchen Xu, Luyao Niu, Bill Yuchen Lin, Radha Poovendran*

- `2406.12935v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12935v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12935v2)

> Large language models (LLMs) are expected to follow instructions from users and engage in conversations. Techniques to enhance LLMs' instruction-following capabilities typically fine-tune them using data structured according to a predefined chat template. Although chat templates are shown to be effective in optimizing LLM performance, their impact on safety alignment of LLMs has been less understood, which is crucial for deploying LLMs safely at scale.   In this paper, we investigate how chat templates affect safety alignment of LLMs. We identify a common vulnerability, named ChatBug, that is introduced by chat templates. Our key insight to identify ChatBug is that the chat templates provide a rigid format that need to be followed by LLMs, but not by users. Hence, a malicious user may not necessarily follow the chat template when prompting LLMs. Instead, malicious users could leverage their knowledge of the chat template and accordingly craft their prompts to bypass safety alignments of LLMs. We develop two attacks to exploit the ChatBug vulnerability. We demonstrate that a malicious user can exploit the ChatBug vulnerability of eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and effectively elicit unintended responses from these models. Moreover, we show that ChatBug can be exploited by existing jailbreak attacks to enhance their attack success rates. We investigate potential countermeasures to ChatBug. Our results show that while adversarial training effectively mitigates the ChatBug vulnerability, the victim model incurs significant performance degradation. These results highlight the trade-off between safety alignment and helpfulness. Developing new methods for instruction tuning to balance this trade-off is an open and critical direction for future research

> Text-to-image (T2I) models have been shown to be vulnerable to misuse, particularly in generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 7.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in their reservoir of knowledge and understanding capabilities, but they have also been shown to be prone to illegal or unethical reactions when subjected to jailbreak attacks. To ensure their responsible deployment in critical applications, it is crucial to understand the safety capabilities and vulnerabilities of LLMs. Previous works mainly focus on jailbreak in single-round dialogue, overlooking the potential jailbreak risks in multi-round dialogues, which are a vital way humans interact with and extract information from LLMs. Some studies have increasingly concentrated on the risks associated with jailbreak in multi-round dialogues. These efforts typically involve the use of manually crafted templates or prompt engineering techniques. However, due to the inherent complexity of multi-round dialogues, their jailbreak performance is limited. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-round dialogue jailbreaking agent, emphasizing the importance of stealthiness in identifying and mitigating potential threats to human values posed by LLMs. We propose a risk decomposition strategy that distributes risks across multiple rounds of queries and utilizes psychological strategies to enhance attack strength. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method surpasses other attack methods and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate. We will make the corresponding code and dataset available for future research. The code will be released soon.

> Phishing attacks are a major threat to online security, exploiting user vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information. Various methods have been developed to counteract phishing, each with varying levels of accuracy, but they also face notable limitations. In this study, we introduce PhishAgent, a multimodal agent that combines a wide range of tools, integrating both online and offline knowledge bases with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This combination leads to broader brand coverage, which enhances brand recognition and recall. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal information retrieval framework designed to extract the relevant top k items from offline knowledge bases, using available information from a webpage, including logos and HTML. Our empirical results, based on three real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces both false positives and false negatives, while maintaining model efficiency. Additionally, PhishAgent shows strong resilience against various types of adversarial attacks.

> The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to black-box adversarial attacks is one of the most heated topics in trustworthy AI. In such attacks, the attackers operate without any insider knowledge of the model, making the cross-model transferability of adversarial examples critical. Despite the potential for adversarial examples to be effective across various models, it has been observed that adversarial examples that are specifically crafted for a specific model often exhibit poor transferability. In this paper, we explore the transferability of adversarial examples via the lens of Bayesian approach. Specifically, we leverage Bayesian approach to probe the transferability and then study what constitutes a transferability-promoting prior. Following this, we design two concrete transferability-promoting priors, along with an adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for instances sampled from these priors. Employing these techniques, we present BayAtk. Extensive experiments illustrate the significant effectiveness of BayAtk in crafting more transferable adversarial examples against both undefended and defended black-box models compared to existing state-of-the-art attacks.

> Version control systems are commonly used to manage open-source software, in which each commit may introduce new vulnerabilities or fix existing ones. Researchers have developed various tools for detecting vulnerabilities in code commits, but their performance is limited by factors such as neglecting descriptive data and challenges in accurately identifying vulnerability introductions. To overcome these limitations, we propose CommitShield, which combines the code analysis capabilities of static analysis tools with the natural language and code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy of vulnerability introduction and fix detection by generating precise descriptions and obtaining rich patch contexts. We evaluate CommitShield using the newly constructed vulnerability repair dataset, CommitVulFix, and a cleaned vulnerability introduction dataset. Experimental results indicate that CommitShield improves recall by 76%-87% over state-of-the-art methods in the vulnerability fix detection task, and its F1-score improves by 15%-27% in the vulnerability introduction detection task.

> Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to LLMs form Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced various downstream graph-relevant tasks, encompassing recommender systems, molecular structure prediction, social media analysis, etc. Despite the boosts of GNN, recent research has empirically demonstrated its potential vulnerability to backdoor attacks, wherein adversaries employ triggers to poison input samples, inducing GNN to adversary-premeditated malicious outputs. This is typically due to the controlled training process, or the deployment of untrusted models, such as delegating model training to third-party service, leveraging external training sets, and employing pre-trained models from online sources. Although there's an ongoing increase in research on GNN backdoors, comprehensive investigation into this field is lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose the first survey dedicated to GNN backdoors. We begin by outlining the fundamental definition of GNN, followed by the detailed summarization and categorization of current GNN backdoor attacks and defenses based on their technical characteristics and application scenarios. Subsequently, the analysis of the applicability and use cases of GNN backdoors is undertaken. Finally, the exploration of potential research directions of GNN backdoors is presented. This survey aims to explore the principles of graph backdoors, provide insights to defenders, and promote future security research.

> Containerization is the mainstream of current software development, which enables software to be used across platforms without additional configuration of running environment. However, many images created by developers are redundant and contain unnecessary code, packages, and components. This excess not only leads to bloated images that are cumbersome to transmit and store but also increases the attack surface, making them more vulnerable to security threats. Therefore, image slimming has emerged as a significant area of interest. Nevertheless, existing image slimming technologies face challenges, particularly regarding the incomplete extraction of environment dependencies required by project code. In this paper, we present a novel image slimming model named {\delta}-SCALPEL. This model employs static data dependency analysis to extract the environment dependencies of the project code and utilizes a data structure called the command linked list for modeling the image's file system. We select 20 NPM projects and two official Docker Hub images to construct a dataset for evaluating {\delta}-SCALPEL. The evaluation results show that {\delta}-SCALPEL can reduce image sizes by up to 61.4% while ensuring the normal operation of these projects.

> Pre-training a language model and then fine-tuning it has shown to be an efficient and effective technique for a wide range of code intelligence tasks, such as code generation, code summarization, and vulnerability detection. However, pretraining language models on a large-scale code corpus is computationally expensive. Fortunately, many off-the-shelf Pre-trained Code Models (PCMs), such as CodeBERT, CodeT5, CodeGen, and Code Llama, have been released publicly. These models acquire general code understanding and generation capability during pretraining, which enhances their performance on downstream code intelligence tasks. With an increasing number of these public pre-trained models, selecting the most suitable one to reuse for a specific task is essential. In this paper, we systematically investigate the reusability of PCMs. We first explore three intuitive model selection methods that select by size, training data, or brute-force fine-tuning. Experimental results show that these straightforward techniques either perform poorly or suffer high costs. Motivated by these findings, we explore learning-based model selection strategies that utilize pre-trained models without altering their parameters. Specifically, we train proxy models to gauge the performance of pre-trained models, and measure the distribution deviation between a model's latent features and the task's labels, using their closeness as an indicator of model transferability. We conduct experiments on 100 widely-used opensource PCMs for code intelligence tasks, with sizes ranging from 42.5 million to 3 billion parameters. The results demonstrate that learning-based selection methods reduce selection time to 100 seconds, compared to 2,700 hours with brute-force fine-tuning, with less than 6% performance degradation across related tasks.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the most promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence, and the software engineering community has readily noticed their potential role in the software development life-cycle. Developers routinely ask LLMs to generate code snippets, increasing productivity but also potentially introducing ownership, privacy, correctness, and security issues. Previous work highlighted how code generated by mainstream commercial LLMs is often not safe, containing vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells. In this paper, we present a framework that leverages testing and static analysis to assess the quality, and guide the self-improvement, of code generated by general-purpose, open-source LLMs.   First, we ask LLMs to generate C code to solve a number of programming tasks. Then we employ ground-truth tests to assess the (in)correctness of the generated code, and a static analysis tool to detect potential safety vulnerabilities. Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generated code, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the models ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced during the static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback.   Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the generated code can include safety issues. Moreover, they perform very poorly at detecting either issue. On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability to fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or potential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the safety of LLM-based code generation tools.

Our goal is to spotlight imminent challenges faced by AV operators and explore emerging technologies for comprehensive solutions. This research outlines the diverse security layers, spanning physical, cyber, coding, and communication aspects, in the context of AVs. Furthermore, we provide insights into potential solutions for each potential attack vector, ensuring that autonomous vehicles remain secure and resilient in an evolving threat landscape.

> In this paper, we present a challenging code reasoning task: vulnerability detection. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in natural-language and math reasoning, but state-of-the-art (SOTA) models reported only 54.5% Balanced Accuracy in our vulnerability detection evaluation, even those models pre-trained on large amounts of source code. Our error analysis on LLM responses shows that the models struggle to reason about the code semantics relevant to identifying vulnerabilities, especially subtle semantic differences caused by small textual changes. We explored prominent models and training settings to understand their effects on vulnerability detection performance -- including better prompts, larger models, more pre-training data, and fine-tuning -- but none led to significant improvements. This raises the question of whether simply scaling training data and model size will allow us to "solve" complex code reasoning tasks like vulnerability detection, or if a fundamental shift in modeling and training techniques is required. We also explored adding domain knowledge to prompts; although it helped certain models understand some code semantics, vulnerability detection requires multi-step reasoning, and these models still failed in steps, such as reasoning about variable relations. Our results suggest that new models, new training methods, or more execution-specific pretraining data may be needed to conquer vulnerability detection. We speculate that auto-regressive pre-training on source code may not effectively extract code semantics, especially on the current pretraining mixtures, in which execution data is scarce. Success on vulnerability detection as a code reasoning task can benefit many areas of software engineering such as debugging, test input generation, and program repair.

> Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks, and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$. Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.

> Deep learning (DL) libraries, widely used in AI applications, often contain vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors. Traditional fuzzing struggles with the complexity and API diversity of DL libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, which feature over 1,000 APIs. Testing all these APIs is challenging due to complex inputs and varied usage patterns. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code understanding and generation, existing LLM-based fuzzers lack deep knowledge of API edge cases and struggle with test input generation. To address this, we propose DFUZZ, an LLM-driven fuzzing approach for DL libraries. DFUZZ leverages two insights: (1) LLMs can reason about error-triggering edge cases from API code and apply this knowledge to untested APIs, and (2) LLMs can accurately synthesize test programs to automate API testing. By providing LLMs with a "white-box view" of APIs, DFUZZ enhances reasoning and generation for comprehensive fuzzing. Experimental results show that DFUZZ outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in API coverage for TensorFlow and PyTorch, uncovering 37 bugs, with 8 fixed and 19 under developer investigation.

> Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without relying on a central server. Although some BFL frameworks are considered privacy-preserving, they are still vulnerable to various attacks, including inference and model poisoning. Additionally, most of these solutions employ strong trust assumptions among all participating entities or introduce incentive mechanisms to encourage collaboration, making them susceptible to multiple security flaws. This work presents VerifBFL, a trustless, privacy-preserving, and verifiable federated learning framework that integrates blockchain technology and cryptographic protocols. By employing zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) and incrementally verifiable computation (IVC), VerifBFL ensures the verifiability of both local training and aggregation processes. The proofs of training and aggregation are verified on-chain, guaranteeing the integrity and auditability of each participant's contributions. To protect training data from inference attacks, VerifBFL leverages differential privacy. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocols, we built a proof of concept using emerging tools. The results show that generating proofs for local training and aggregation in VerifBFL takes less than 81s and 2s, respectively, while verifying them on-chain takes less than 0.6s.

> Toxicity detection is crucial for maintaining the peace of the society. While existing methods perform well on normal toxic contents or those generated by specific perturbation methods, they are vulnerable to evolving perturbation patterns. However, in real-world scenarios, malicious users tend to create new perturbation patterns for fooling the detectors. For example, some users may circumvent the detector of large language models (LLMs) by adding `I am a scientist' at the beginning of the prompt. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem, i.e., continual learning jailbreak perturbation patterns, into the toxicity detection field. To tackle this problem, we first construct a new dataset generated by 9 types of perturbation patterns, 7 of them are summarized from prior work and 2 of them are developed by us. We then systematically validate the vulnerability of current methods on this new perturbation pattern-aware dataset via both the zero-shot and fine tuned cross-pattern detection. Upon this, we present the domain incremental learning paradigm and the corresponding benchmark to ensure the detector's robustness to dynamically emerging types of perturbed toxic text. Our code and dataset are provided in the appendix and will be publicly available at GitHub, by which we wish to offer new research opportunities for the security-relevant communities.

> With the exponential rise in the use of cloud services, smart devices, and IoT devices, advanced cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of computing architectures and memory technologies has created an urgent need to understand and address hardware security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review the current state of vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies in contemporary computing systems. We discuss cache side-channel attacks (including Spectre and Meltdown), power side-channel attacks (such as Simple Power Analysis, Differential Power Analysis, Correlation Power Analysis, and Template Attacks), and advanced techniques like Voltage Glitching and Electromagnetic Analysis to help understand and build robust cybersecurity defense systems and guide further research. We also examine memory encryption, focusing on confidentiality, granularity, key management, masking, and re-keying strategies. Additionally, we cover Cryptographic Instruction Set Architectures, Secure Boot, Root of Trust mechanisms, Physical Unclonable Functions, and hardware fault injection techniques. The paper concludes with an analysis of the RISC-V architecture's unique security challenges. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper is essential for building resilient hardware security solutions that can protect against both current and emerging threats in an increasingly challenging security landscape.

Unlike FL, FR has a unique sparse aggregation mechanism, where the embedding of each item is updated by only partial clients, instead of full clients in a dense aggregation of general FL. Recently, as an essential principle of FL, model security has received increasing attention, especially for Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients can send arbitrary updates. The problem of exploring the Byzantine robustness of FR is particularly critical since in the domains applying FR, e.g., e-commerce, malicious clients can be injected easily by registering new accounts. However, existing Byzantine works neglect the unique sparse aggregation of FR, making them unsuitable for our problem. Thus, we make the first effort to investigate Byzantine attacks on FR from the perspective of sparse aggregation, which is non-trivial: it is not clear how to define Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregations and design Byzantine attacks under limited knowledge/capability. In this paper, we reformulate the Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregation by defining the aggregation for a single item as the smallest execution unit. Then we propose a family of effective attack strategies, named Spattack, which exploit the vulnerability in sparse aggregation and are categorized along the adversary's knowledge and capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Spattack can effectively prevent convergence and even break down defenses under a few malicious clients, raising alarms for securing FR systems.

> Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is inherently vulnerable to poisoning attacks, as malicious clients can transmit manipulated model gradients to neighboring clients. Existing defense methods either reject suspicious gradients per iteration or restart DFL aggregation after detecting all malicious clients. They overlook the potential accuracy benefit from the discarded malicious gradients. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient purification defense, named GPD, that integrates seamlessly with existing DFL aggregation to defend against poisoning attacks. It aims to mitigate the harm in model gradients while retaining the benefit in model weights for enhancing accuracy. For each benign client in GPD, a recording variable is designed to track the historically aggregated gradients from one of its neighbors. It allows benign clients to precisely detect malicious neighbors and swiftly mitigate aggregated malicious gradients via historical consistency checks. Upon mitigation, GPD optimizes model weights via aggregating gradients solely from benign clients. This retains the previously beneficial portions from malicious clients and exploits the contributions from benign clients, thereby significantly enhancing the model accuracy. We analyze the convergence of GPD, as well as its ability to harvest high accuracy. Extensive experiments over three datasets demonstrate that, GPD is capable of mitigating poisoning attacks under both iid and non-iid data distributions. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in terms of accuracy against various poisoning attacks.

> Security must be considered in almost every software system. Unfortunately, selecting and implementing security features remains challenging due to the variety of security threats and possible countermeasures. While security standards are intended to help developers, they are usually too abstract and vague to help implement security features, or they merely help configure such. A resource that describes security features at an abstraction level between high-level (i.e., rather too general) and low-level (i.e., rather too specific) security standards could facilitate secure systems development. To realize security features, developers typically use external security frameworks, to minimize implementation mistakes. Even then, developers still make mistakes, often resulting in security vulnerabilities. When security incidents occur or the system needs to be audited or maintained, it is essential to know the implemented security features and, more importantly, where they are located. This task, commonly referred to as feature location, is often tedious and error-prone. Therefore, we have to support long-term tracking of implemented security features.   We present a study of security features in the literature and their coverage in popular security frameworks. We contribute (1) a taxonomy of 68 functional implementation-level security features including a mapping to widely used security standards, (2) an examination of 21 popular security frameworks concerning which of these security features they provide, and (3) a discussion on the representation of security features in source code. Our taxonomy aims to aid developers in selecting appropriate security features and frameworks and relating them to security standards when they need to choose and implement security features for a software system.

> Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs for this purpose. However, traditional full-parameter fine-tuning is inefficient for modern, complex LLMs, which contain billions of parameters.   Soft prompt tuning has been suggested as a more efficient alternative for fine-tuning LLMs in general cases. However, pure soft prompt tuning treats source code as plain text, losing structural information inherent in source code. Meanwhile, graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning methods, which aim to address this issue, are unable to preserve the rich semantic information within code graphs, as they are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while accounting for graph-text interactions.   This paper, therefore, introduces a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection, referred to as CGP-Tuning. It employs innovative type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with a novel and efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational cost while incorporating graph-text interactions. The proposed CGP-Tuning is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and the most recent open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama and CodeGemma. Experimental results demonstrate that CGP-Tuning outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by an average of 3.5 percentage points in accuracy, without compromising its vulnerability detection capabilities for long source code.

> With the rapid advancement of large models (LMs), the development of general-purpose intelligent agents powered by LMs has become a reality. It is foreseeable that in the near future, LM-driven general AI agents will serve as essential tools in production tasks, capable of autonomous communication and collaboration without human intervention. This paper investigates scenarios involving the autonomous collaboration of future LM agents. We review the current state of LM agents, the key technologies enabling LM agent collaboration, and the security and privacy challenges they face during cooperative operations. To this end, we first explore the foundational principles of LM agents, including their general architecture, key components, enabling technologies, and modern applications. We then discuss practical collaboration paradigms from data, computation, and knowledge perspectives to achieve connected intelligence among LM agents. After that, we analyze the security vulnerabilities and privacy risks associated with LM agents, particularly in multi-agent settings, examining underlying mechanisms and reviewing current and potential countermeasures. Lastly, we propose future research directions for building robust and secure LM agent ecosystems.

> Recent advancements in natural language processing have highlighted the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks. While various defence mechanisms have been proposed, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate these defences across diverse datasets, models, and tasks. In this work, we address this gap by presenting an extensive benchmark for textual adversarial defence that significantly expands upon previous work. Our benchmark incorporates a wide range of datasets, evaluates state-of-the-art defence mechanisms, and extends the assessment to include critical tasks such as single-sentence classification, similarity and paraphrase identification, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. This work not only serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of adversarial robustness but also identifies key areas for future research in textual adversarial defence. By establishing a new standard for benchmarking in this domain, we aim to accelerate progress towards more robust and reliable natural language processing systems.

> Organizations run applications on cloud infrastructure shared between multiple users and organizations. Popular tooling for this shared infrastructure, including Docker and Kubernetes, supports such multi-tenancy through the use of operating system virtualization. With operating system virtualization (known as containerization), multiple applications share the same kernel, reducing the runtime overhead. However, this shared kernel presents a large attack surface and has led to a proliferation of container escape attacks in which a kernel exploit lets an attacker escape the isolation of operating system virtualization to access other applications or the operating system itself. To address this, some systems have proposed a return to hypervisor virtualization for stronger isolation between applications. However, no existing system has achieved both the isolation of hypervisor virtualization and the performance and usability of operating system virtualization.   We present Edera, an optimized type 1 hypervisor that uses paravirtualization to improve the runtime of hypervisor virtualization. We illustrate Edera's usability and performance through two use cases. First, we create a container runtime compatible with Kubernetes that runs on the Edera hypervisor. This implementation can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Kubernetes runtime and is compatible with all the tooling in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Second, we use Edera to provide driver isolation for hardware drivers, including those for networking, storage, and GPUs. This use of isolation protects the hypervisor and other applications from driver vulnerabilities. We find that Edera has runtime comparable to Docker with .9% slower cpu speeds, an average of 3% faster system call performance, and memory performance 0-7% faster. It achieves this with a 648 millisecond increase in startup time from Docker's 177.4 milliseconds.

> Automated Program Repair (APR) for smart contract security promises to automatically mitigate smart contract vulnerabilities responsible for billions in financial losses. However, the true effectiveness of this research in addressing smart contract exploits remains uncharted territory. This paper bridges this critical gap by introducing a novel and systematic experimental framework for evaluating exploit mitigation of program repair tools for smart contracts. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze 20 state-of-the-art APR tools using a dataset of 143 vulnerable smart contracts, for which we manually craft 91 executable exploits. We are the very first to define and measure the essential "exploit mitigation rate", giving researchers and practitioners and real sense of effectiveness of cutting edge techniques. Our findings reveal substantial disparities in the state of the art, with an exploit mitigation rate ranging from a low of 27% to a high of 73%, a result that nobody would guess from reading the original papers. Our study identifies systemic limitations, such as inconsistent functionality preservation, that must be addressed in future research on program repair for smart contracts.

> Recent advancements in robots powered by large language models have enhanced their conversational abilities, enabling interactions closely resembling human dialogue. However, these models introduce safety and security concerns in HRI, as they are vulnerable to manipulation that can bypass built-in safety measures. Imagining a social robot deployed in a home, this work aims to understand how everyday users try to exploit a language model to violate ethical principles, such as by prompting the robot to act like a life partner. We conducted a pilot study involving 21 university students who interacted with a Misty robot, attempting to circumvent its safety mechanisms across three scenarios based on specific HRI ethical principles: attachment, freedom, and empathy. Our results reveal that participants employed five techniques, including insulting and appealing to pity using emotional language. We hope this work can inform future research in designing strong safeguards to ensure ethical and secure human-robot interactions.

> High-performance IO demands low-overhead communication between user- and kernel space. This demand can no longer be fulfilled by traditional system calls. Linux's extended Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) avoids user-/kernel transitions by just-in-time compiling user-provided bytecode and executing it in kernel mode with near-native speed. To still isolate BPF programs from the kernel, they are statically analyzed for memory- and type-safety, which imposes some restrictions but allows for good expressiveness and high performance. However, to mitigate the Spectre vulnerabilities disclosed in 2018, defenses which reject potentially-dangerous programs had to be deployed. We find that this affects 31% to 54% of programs in a dataset with 844 real-world BPF programs from popular open-source projects. To solve this, users are forced to disable the defenses to continue using the programs, which puts the entire system at risk.   To enable secure and expressive untrusted Linux kernel extensions, we propose VeriFence, an enhancement to the kernel's Spectre defenses that reduces the number of BPF application programs rejected from 54% to zero. We measure VeriFence's overhead for all mainstream performance-sensitive applications of BPF (i.e., event tracing, profiling, and packet processing) and find that it improves significantly upon the status-quo where affected BPF programs are either unusable or enable transient execution attacks on the kernel.

> Purpose: Quantum computing promises to transform problem-solving across various domains with rapid and practical solutions. Within Software Evolution and Maintenance, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) remains mostly an underexplored domain, particularly in addressing challenges such as detecting buggy software commits from code repositories. Methods: In this study, we investigate the practical application of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVC) for detecting buggy software commits across 14 open-source software projects with diverse dataset sizes encompassing 30,924 data instances. We compare the QML algorithm PQSVC (Pegasos QSVC) and QSVC against the classical Support Vector Classifier (SVC). Our technique addresses large datasets in QSVC algorithms by dividing them into smaller subsets. We propose and evaluate an aggregation method to combine predictions from these models to detect the entire test dataset. We also introduce an incremental testing methodology to overcome the difficulties of quantum feature mapping during the testing approach. Results: The study shows the effectiveness of QSVC and PQSVC in detecting buggy software commits. The aggregation technique successfully combines predictions from smaller data subsets, enhancing the overall detection accuracy for the entire test dataset. The incremental testing methodology effectively manages the challenges associated with quantum feature mapping during the testing process. Conclusion: We contribute to the advancement of QML algorithms in defect prediction, unveiling the potential for further research in this domain. The specific scenario of the Short-Term Activity Frame (STAF) highlights the early detection of buggy software commits during the initial developmental phases of software systems, particularly when dataset sizes remain insufficient to train machine learning models.

> Current methods that train large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning feedback, often resort to averaging outputs of multiple rewards functions during training. This overlooks crucial aspects of individual reward dimensions and inter-reward dependencies that can lead to sub-optimal outcomes in generations. In this work, we show how linear aggregation of rewards exhibits some vulnerabilities that can lead to undesired properties of generated text. We then propose a transformation of reward functions inspired by economic theory of utility functions (specifically Inada conditions), that enhances sensitivity to low reward values while diminishing sensitivity to already high values. We compare our approach to the existing baseline methods that linearly aggregate rewards and show how the Inada-inspired reward feedback is superior to traditional weighted averaging. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the difference in the methods, and see that models trained with Inada-transformations score as more helpful while being less harmful.

> Code Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate great versatility in adapting to various downstream tasks, including code generation and completion, as well as bug detection and fixing. However, Code LLMs often fail to capture existing coding standards, leading to the generation of code that conflicts with the required design patterns for a given project. As a result, developers must post-process to adapt the generated code to the project's design norms. In this work, we empirically investigate the biases of Code LLMs in software development. Through carefully designed experiments, we assess the models' understanding of design patterns across recognition, comprehension, and generation. Our findings reveal that biases in Code LLMs significantly affect the reliability of downstream tasks.

> Abstract: Failing test case reduction can promote efficient debugging because a developer may not need to observe components that are not relevant to inducing failure. Failing test case reduction can also improve the efficiency of fault localization. These considerations have prompted researchers to study the reduction process, the reduction output, and the removed entities. Christi et al. studied test reduction using a tool called ReduSharptor for C# tests. They considered the test to be an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Based on that, they studied the reduction outcome and removed entities in terms of Leaf nodes and Non-Leaf nodes of the AST. They claimed that (1) leaf nodes are removed in large numbers, and (2) the probability of removal is slightly higher than non-leaf nodes. We replicate their results using a different test case reduction tool, ReduJavator, for Java unit tests. We evaluate test reduction using 30 randomly chosen bugs from the Defects4J database and 30 mutants for 6 open-source projects. Our results confirm their first claim: leaf nodes are removed in large numbers. Our results are inconclusive regarding their second claim; we cannot confirm that the probability of removal is higher for non-leaf nodes.

> Performance bugs are non-functional bugs that can even manifest in well-tested commercial products. Fixing these performance bugs is an important yet challenging problem. In this work, we address this challenge and present a new approach called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Generation (RAPGen). Given a code snippet with a performance issue, RAPGen first retrieves a prompt instruction from a pre-constructed knowledge-base of previous performance bug fixes and then generates a prompt using the retrieved instruction. It then uses this prompt on a Large Language Model (such as Codex) in zero-shot to generate a fix. We compare our approach with the various prompt variations and state of the art methods in the task of performance bug fixing. Our evaluation shows that RAPGen can generate performance improvement suggestions equivalent or better than a developer in ~60% of the cases, getting ~42% of them verbatim, in an expert-verified dataset of past performance changes made by C# developers.

> This paper proposes LATTE, the first static binary taint analysis that is powered by a large language model (LLM). LATTE is superior to the state of the art (e.g., Emtaint, Arbiter, Karonte) in three aspects. First, LATTE is fully automated while prior static binary taint analyzers need rely on human expertise to manually customize taint propagation rules and vulnerability inspection rules. Second, LATTE is significantly effective in vulnerability detection, demonstrated by our comprehensive evaluations. For example, LATTE has found 37 new bugs in real-world firmware which the baselines failed to find, and 7 of them have been assigned CVE numbers. Lastly, LATTE incurs remarkably low engineering cost, making it a cost-efficient and scalable solution for security researchers and practitioners. We strongly believe that LATTE opens up a new direction to harness the recent advance in LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis for binary programs.

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance and have been put into practical use in commercial applications, but they still have potential safety mechanism vulnerabilities. Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks. In particular, SI-Attack can obviously improve the attack success rate for commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o or Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

> Today's Android developers tend to include numerous features to accommodate diverse user requirements, which inevitably leads to bloated apps. Yet more often than not, only a fraction of these features are frequently utilized by users, thus a bloated app costs dearly in potential vulnerabilities, expanded attack surfaces, and additional resource consumption. Especially in the event of severe security incidents, users have the need to block vulnerable functionalities immediately. Existing works have proposed various code debloating approaches for identifying and removing features of executable components. However, they typically involve static modification of files (and, for Android apps, repackaging of APKs, too), which lacks user convenience let alone undermining the security model of Android due to the compromising of public key verification and code integrity checks. This paper introduces 3DNDroid, a Dynamic Debloating approach targeting both DEX and Native methods in AnDroid apps. Using an unprivileged management app in tandem with a customized Android OS, 3DNDroid dynamically reduces unnecessary code loading during app execution based on a pre-generated debloating schema from static or dynamic analyses. It intercepts invocations of debloated bytecode methods to prevent their interpretation, compilation, and execution, while zero-filling memory spaces of debloated native methods during code loading. Evaluation demonstrates 3DNDroid's ability to debloat 187 DEX methods and 30 native methods across 55 real-world apps, removing over 10K Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) gadgets. Case studies confirm its effectiveness in mitigating vulnerabilities, and performance assessments highlight its resource-saving advantages over non-debloated apps.

> Federated learning is a computing paradigm that enhances privacy by enabling multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without revealing personal data. However, current research indicates that traditional federated learning platforms are unable to ensure privacy due to privacy leaks caused by the interchange of gradients. To achieve privacy-preserving federated learning, integrating secure aggregation mechanisms is essential. Unfortunately, existing solutions are vulnerable to recently demonstrated inference attacks such as the disaggregation attack. This paper proposes TAPFed, an approach for achieving privacy-preserving federated learning in the context of multiple decentralized aggregators with malicious actors. TAPFed uses a proposed threshold functional encryption scheme and allows for a certain number of malicious aggregators while maintaining security and privacy. We provide formal security and privacy analyses of TAPFed and compare it to various baselines through experimental evaluation. Our results show that TAPFed offers equivalent performance in terms of model quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches while reducing transmission overhead by 29%-45% across different model training scenarios. Most importantly, TAPFed can defend against recently demonstrated inference attacks caused by curious aggregators, which the majority of existing approaches are susceptible to.

> The strong performance of large language models (LLMs) raises extensive discussion on their application to code generation. Recent research suggests continuous program refinements through visible tests to improve code generation accuracy in LLMs. However, these methods suffer from LLMs' inefficiency and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, the solution generation phase formulates a solution plan, which is then verified through visible tests to specify the intended natural language solution. Subsequently, the code implementation phase drafts an initial code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended solution to consistently inform the refinement process for correcting bugs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods across various existing LLMs, LPW significantly improves the Pass@1 accuracy by up to 16.4% on well-established text-to-code generation benchmarks. LPW also sets new state-of-the-art Pass@1 accuracy, achieving 98.2% on HumanEval, 84.8% on MBPP, 59.3% on LiveCode, 62.6% on APPS, and 34.7% on CodeContest, using GPT-4o as the backbone.

- `2501.05079v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05079v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05079v1)

> Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems applied across various domains, including NLP, information retrieval, and recommendation systems. Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.

> Large language models, despite extensive alignment with human values and ethical principles, remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks that exploit their reasoning abilities. Existing safety measures often detect overt malicious intent but fail to address subtle, reasoning-driven vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), a novel jailbreak technique that harnesses contrastive reasoning to provoke unethical responses. POATE crafts semantically opposing intents and integrates them with adversarial templates, steering models toward harmful outputs with remarkable subtlety. We conduct extensive evaluation across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. To counter this, we propose Intent-Aware CoT and Reverse Thinking CoT, which decompose queries to detect malicious intent and reason in reverse to evaluate and reject harmful responses. These methods enhance reasoning robustness and strengthen the model's defense against adversarial exploits.

> Automated Program Repair (APR) for smart contract security promises to automatically mitigate smart contract vulnerabilities responsible for billions in financial losses. However, the true effectiveness of this research in addressing smart contract exploits remains uncharted territory. This paper bridges this critical gap by introducing a novel and systematic experimental framework for evaluating exploit mitigation of program repair tools for smart contracts. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze 20 state-of-the-art APR tools using a dataset of 143 vulnerable smart contracts, for which we manually craft 91 executable exploits. We are the very first to define and measure the essential "exploit mitigation rate", giving researchers and practitioners and real sense of effectiveness of cutting edge techniques. Our findings reveal substantial disparities in the state of the art, with an exploit mitigation rate ranging from a low of 27% to a high of 73%, a result that nobody would guess from reading the original papers. Our study identifies systemic limitations, such as inconsistent functionality preservation, that must be addressed in future research on program repair for smart contracts.

> Autonomous vehicles rely on camera-based perception systems to comprehend their driving environment and make crucial decisions, thereby ensuring vehicles to steer safely. However, a significant threat known as Electromagnetic Signal Injection Attacks (ESIA) can distort the images captured by these cameras, leading to incorrect AI decisions and potentially compromising the safety of autonomous vehicles. Despite the serious implications of ESIA, there is limited understanding of its impacts on the robustness of AI models across various and complex driving scenarios. To address this gap, our research analyzes the performance of different models under ESIA, revealing their vulnerabilities to the attacks. Moreover, due to the challenges in obtaining real-world attack data, we develop a novel ESIA simulation method and generate a simulated attack dataset for different driving scenarios. Our research provides a comprehensive simulation and evaluation framework, aiming to enhance the development of more robust AI models and secure intelligent systems, ultimately contributing to the advancement of safer and more reliable technology across various fields.

> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in applications where system prompts, which guide model outputs, play a crucial role. These prompts often contain business logic and sensitive information, making their protection essential. However, adversarial and even regular user queries can exploit LLM vulnerabilities to expose these hidden prompts. To address this issue, we propose PromptKeeper, a robust defense mechanism designed to safeguard system prompts. PromptKeeper tackles two core challenges: reliably detecting prompt leakage and mitigating side-channel vulnerabilities when leakage occurs. By framing detection as a hypothesis-testing problem, PromptKeeper effectively identifies both explicit and subtle leakage. Upon detection, it regenerates responses using a dummy prompt, ensuring that outputs remain indistinguishable from typical interactions when no leakage is present. PromptKeeper ensures robust protection against prompt extraction attacks via either adversarial or regular queries, while preserving conversational capability and runtime efficiency during benign user interactions.

> Involving people in energy systems planning can increase the legitimacy and socio-political feasibility of energy transitions. Participatory research in energy modelling offers the opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a comprehensive way, but is limited by how results can be generated and presented without imposing assumptions and discrete scenarios on the participants. To this end, we present a methodology and a framework, based on near-optimal modelling results, that can incorporate stakeholders in a holistic and engaging way. We confront stakeholders with a continuum of modelling-based energy system designs via an interactive interface allowing them to choose essentially any combination of components that meet the system requirements. Together with information on the implications of different technologies, it is possible to assess how participants prioritise different aspects in energy systems planning while also facilitating learning in an engaging and stimulating way. We showcase the methodology for the remote Arctic settlement of Longyearbyen and illustrate how participants deviate consistently from the cost optimum. At the same time, they manage to balance different priorities such as emissions, costs, and system vulnerability leading to a better understanding of the complexity and intertwined nature of decisions.

> The transportation industry is experiencing vast digitalization as a plethora of technologies are being implemented to improve efficiency, functionality, and safety. Although technological advancements bring many benefits to transportation, integrating cyberspace across transportation sectors has introduced new and deliberate cyber threats. In the past, public agencies assumed digital infrastructure was secured since its vulnerabilities were unknown to adversaries. However, with the expansion of cyberspace, this assumption has become invalid. With the rapid advancement of wireless technologies, transportation systems are increasingly interconnected with both transportation and non-transportation networks in an internet-of-things ecosystem, expanding cyberspace in transportation and increasing threats and vulnerabilities. This study investigates some prominent reasons for the increase in cyber vulnerabilities in transportation. In addition, this study presents various collaborative strategies among stakeholders that could help improve cybersecurity in the transportation industry. These strategies address programmatic and policy aspects and suggest avenues for technological research and development. The latter highlights opportunities for future research to enhance the cybersecurity of transportation systems and infrastructure by leveraging hybrid approaches and emerging technologies.

> Every maneuver of a vehicle redistributes risks between road users. While human drivers do this intuitively, autonomous vehicles allow and require deliberative algorithmic risk management. But how should traffic risks be distributed among road users? In a global experimental study in eight countries with different cultural backgrounds and almost 11,000 participants, we compared risk distribution preferences. It turns out that risk preferences in road traffic are strikingly similar between the cultural zones. The vast majority of participants in all countries deviates from a guiding principle of minimizing accident probabilities in favor of weighing up the probability and severity of accidents. At the national level, the consideration of accident probability and severity hardly differs between countries. The social dilemma of autonomous vehicles detected in deterministic crash scenarios disappears in risk assessments of everyday traffic situations in all countries. In no country do cyclists receive a risk bonus that goes beyond their higher vulnerability. In sum, our results suggest that a global consensus on the risk ethics of autonomous driving is easier to establish than on the ethics of crashing.

> Censorship and censorship circumvention are closely connected, and each is constantly making decisions in reaction to the other. When censors deploy a new Internet censorship technique, the anti-censorship community scrambles to find and develop circumvention strategies against the censor's new strategy, i.e., by targeting and exploiting specific vulnerabilities in the new censorship mechanism. We believe that over-reliance on such a reactive approach to circumvention has given the censors the upper hand in the censorship arms race, becoming a key reason for the inefficacy of in-the-wild circumvention systems. Therefore, we argue for a proactive approach to censorship research: the anti-censorship community should be able to proactively develop circumvention mechanisms against hypothetical or futuristic censorship strategies. To facilitate proactive censorship research, we design and implement CensorLab, a generic platform for emulating Internet censorship scenarios. CensorLab aims to complement currently reactive circumvention research by efficiently emulating past, present, and hypothetical censorship strategies in realistic network environments. Specifically, CensorLab aims to (1) support all censorship mechanisms previously or currently deployed by real-world censors; (2) support the emulation of hypothetical (not-yet-deployed) censorship strategies including advanced data-driven censorship mechanisms (e.g., ML-based traffic classifiers); (3) provide an easy-to-use platform for researchers and practitioners enabling them to perform extensive experimentation; and (4) operate efficiently with minimal overhead. We have implemented CensorLab as a fully functional, flexible, and high-performance platform, and showcase how it can be used to emulate a wide range of censorship scenarios, from traditional IP blocking and keyword filtering to hypothetical ML-based censorship mechanisms.

> Security systems relying on passwords are vulnerable to being forgotten, guessed, or breached. Likewise, biometric systems that operate independently are at risk of template spoofing and replay incidents. This paper introduces a biocryptosystem utilizing face recognition techniques to address these issues, allowing for the encryption and decryption of various file types through the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The proposed system creates a distinct 32-bit encryption key derived from facial features identified by Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and categorized using Support Vector Machines (SVM). HOG efficiently identifies edge-aligned facial features, even in dim lighting, ensuring that reliable biometric keys can be generated. This key is then used with AES to encrypt and decrypt a variety of data formats, such as text, audio, and video files. This encryption key, derived from an individual's distinctive facial traits, is exceedingly challenging for adversaries to reproduce or guess. The security and performance of the system have been validated through experiments using several metrics, including correlation analysis, Shannon entropy, normalized Hamming distance, and the avalanche effect on 25 different file types. Potential uses for the proposed system include secure file sharing, online transactions, and data archiving, making it a strong and trustworthy approach to safeguarding sensitive information by integrating the uniqueness of facial biometrics with the established security of AES encryption.

> Cancelable Biometrics (CB) stands for a range of biometric transformation schemes combining biometrics with user specific tokens to generate secure templates. Required properties are the irreversibility, unlikability and recognition accuracy of templates while making their revocation possible. In biometrics, a key-binding scheme is used for protecting a cryptographic key using a biometric data. The key can be recomputed only if a correct biometric data is acquired during authentication. Applications of key-binding schemes are typically disk encryption, where the cryptographic key is used to encrypt and decrypt the disk. In this paper, we cryptanalyze a recent key-binding scheme, called Cancelable Biometrics Vault (CBV) based on cancelable biometrics. More precisely, the introduced cancelable transformation, called BioEncoding scheme, for instantiating the CBV framework is attacked in terms of reversibility and linkability of templates. Subsequently, our linkability attack enables to recover the key in the vault without additional assumptions. Our cryptanalysis introduces a new perspective by uncovering the CBV scheme's revocability and linkability vulnerabilities, which were not previously identified in comparable biometric-based key-binding schemes.

- `2501.01042v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01042v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01042v2)

> Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models--a common and practical real world scenario--remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal model (IMM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and temporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. In addition, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rates of 55.48% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for VideoQA tasks, respectively. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance through their message-passing mechanism. However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of GNNs to backdoor attacks, which can lead the model to misclassify graphs with attached triggers as the target class. The effectiveness of recent promising defense techniques, such as fine-tuning or distillation, is heavily contingent on having comprehensive knowledge of the sufficient training dataset. Empirical studies have shown that fine-tuning methods require a clean dataset of 20% to reduce attack accuracy to below 25%, while distillation methods require a clean dataset of 15%. However, obtaining such a large amount of clean data is commonly impractical.   In this paper, we propose a practical backdoor mitigation framework, denoted as GRAPHNAD, which can capture high-quality intermediate-layer representations in GNNs to enhance the distillation process with limited clean data. To achieve this, we address the following key questions: How to identify the appropriate attention representations in graphs for distillation? How to enhance distillation with limited data? By adopting the graph attention transfer method, GRAPHNAD can effectively align the intermediate-layer attention representations of the backdoored model with that of the teacher model, forcing the backdoor neurons to transform into benign ones. Besides, we extract the relation maps from intermediate-layer transformation and enforce the relation maps of the backdoored model to be consistent with that of the teacher model, thereby ensuring model accuracy while further reducing the influence of backdoors. Extensive experimental results show that by fine-tuning a teacher model with only 3% of the clean data, GRAPHNAD can reduce the attack success rate to below 5%.

> No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), responsible for assessing the quality of a single input image without using any reference, plays a critical role in evaluating and optimizing computer vision systems, e.g., low-light enhancement. Recent research indicates that NR-IQA models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can significantly alter predicted scores with visually imperceptible perturbations. Despite revealing vulnerabilities, these attack methods have limitations, including high computational demands, untargeted manipulation, limited practical utility in white-box scenarios, and reduced effectiveness in black-box scenarios. To address these challenges, we shift our focus to another significant threat and present a novel poisoning-based backdoor attack against NR-IQA (BAIQA), allowing the attacker to manipulate the IQA model's output to any desired target value by simply adjusting a scaling coefficient $\alpha$ for the trigger. We propose to inject the trigger in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain to improve the local invariance of the trigger for countering trigger diminishment in NR-IQA models due to widely adopted data augmentations. Furthermore, the universal adversarial perturbations (UAP) in the DCT space are designed as the trigger, to increase IQA model susceptibility to manipulation and improve attack effectiveness. In addition to the heuristic method for poison-label BAIQA (P-BAIQA), we explore the design of clean-label BAIQA (C-BAIQA), focusing on $\alpha$ sampling and image data refinement, driven by theoretical insights we reveal. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and various NR-IQA models demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks. Code can be found at https://github.com/yuyi-sd/BAIQA.

> Recent research on backdoor stealthiness focuses mainly on indistinguishable triggers in input space and inseparable backdoor representations in feature space, aiming to circumvent backdoor defenses that examine these respective spaces. However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a specific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of defense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are current backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse practical defenses?   To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on input-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative defenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks designed to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by examining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying causes behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of backdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and feature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter space, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking comprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack called Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective module, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the parameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against state-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset of ImageNet. In addition, we show that ABI consistently improves the effectiveness of common backdoor attacks.

> The skin, as the largest organ of the human body, is vulnerable to a diverse array of conditions collectively known as skin lesions, which encompass various dermatoses. Diagnosing these lesions presents significant challenges for medical practitioners due to the subtle visual differences that are often imperceptible to the naked eye. While not all skin lesions are life-threatening, certain types can act as early indicators of severe diseases, including skin cancers, underscoring the critical need for timely and accurate diagnostic methods. Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable potential in facilitating the early detection and prognosis of skin lesions. This study advances the field by curating a comprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 39 categories of skin lesions, synthesized from five publicly available datasets. Using this dataset, the performance of five state-of-the-art deep learning models -- MobileNetV2, Xception, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB1, and Vision Transformer - is rigorously evaluated. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of these models, attention mechanisms such as the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) are incorporated into their architectures. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple performance metrics reveals that the Vision Transformer model integrated with CBAM outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of 93.46%, precision of 94%, recall of 93%, F1-score of 93%, and specificity of 93.67%. These results underscore the significant potential of the proposed system in supporting medical professionals with accurate and efficient prognostic tools for diagnosing a broad spectrum of skin lesions.

- *Zhifan Lu, Siyang Sun, Yixin Sun*

- `2501.06010v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06010v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06010v1)

> Tor is a well-known anonymous communication tool, used by people with various privacy and security needs. Prior works have exploited routing attacks to observe Tor traffic and deanonymize Tor users. Subsequently, location-aware relay selection algorithms have been proposed to defend against such attacks on Tor. However, location-aware relay selection algorithms are known to be vulnerable to information leakage on client locations and guard placement attacks. Can we design a new location-unaware approach to relay selection while achieving the similar goal of defending against routing attacks? Towards this end, we leverage the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) in designing new guard relay selection algorithms. We develop a lightweight Discount Selection algorithm by only incorporating Route Origin Authorization (ROA) information, and a more secure Matching Selection algorithm by incorporating both ROA and Route Origin Validation (ROV) information. Our evaluation results show an increase in the number of ROA-ROV matched client-relay pairs using our Matching Selection algorithm, reaching 48.47% with minimal performance overhead through custom Shadow simulations and benchmarking.

- *Ashley Andrews, George Oikonomou, Simon Armour, Paul Thomas, Thomas Cattermole*

- `2501.06033v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06033v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06033v1)

> As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes more embedded within our daily lives, there is growing concern about the risk `smart' devices pose to network security. To address this, one avenue of research has focused on automated IoT device identification. Research has however largely neglected the identification of IoT device firmware versions. There is strong evidence that IoT security relies on devices being on the latest version patched for known vulnerabilities. Identifying when a device has updated (has changed version) or not (is on a stable version) is therefore useful for IoT security. Version identification involves challenges beyond those for identifying the model, type, and manufacturer of IoT devices, and traditional machine learning algorithms are ill-suited for effective version identification due to being limited by the availability of data for training. In this paper, we introduce an effective technique for identifying IoT device versions based on transfer learning. This technique relies on the idea that we can use a Twin Neural Network (TNN) - trained at distinguishing devices - to detect differences between a device on different versions. This facilitates real-world implementation by requiring relatively little training data. We extract statistical features from on-wire packet flows, convert these features into greyscale images, pass these images into a TNN, and determine version changes based on the Hedges' g effect size of the similarity scores. This allows us to detect the subtle changes present in on-wire traffic when a device changes version. To evaluate our technique, we set up a lab containing 12 IoT devices and recorded their on-wire packet captures for 11 days across multiple firmware versions. For testing data held out from training, our best performing model is shown to be 95.83% and 84.38% accurate at identifying stable versions and version changes respectively.

<summary>2025-01-10 16:08:47 - Adversarial Detection by Approximation of Ensemble Boundary</summary>

- *T. Windeatt*

- `2211.10227v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10227v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10227v5)

> Despite being effective in many application areas, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to being attacked. In object recognition, the attack takes the form of a small perturbation added to an image, that causes the DNN to misclassify, but to a human appears no different. Adversarial attacks lead to defences that are themselves subject to attack, and the attack/ defence strategies provide important information about the properties of DNNs. In this paper, a novel method of detecting adversarial attacks is proposed for an ensemble of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) solving two-class pattern recognition problems. The ensemble is combined using Walsh coefficients which are capable of approximating Boolean functions and thereby controlling the decision boundary complexity. The hypothesis in this paper is that decision boundaries with high curvature allow adversarial perturbations to be found, but change the curvature of the decision boundary, which is then approximated in a different way by Walsh coefficients compared to the clean images. Besides controlling boundary complexity, the coefficients also measure the correlation with class labels, which may aid in understanding the learning and transferability properties of DNNs. While the experiments here use images, the proposed approach of modelling two-class ensemble decision boundaries could in principle be applied to any application area.

> The rapid development of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) necessitates efficient and secure authentication methods to support high-speed, high-density environments. Current group authentication schemes provide user identity protection and unlinkability but face limitations, such as reliance on a central group manager and vulnerability to collaborative attacks. This paper presents a privacy-preserving authentication scheme that incorporates batch authentication, mutual authentication, and secure key establishment, enabling users to authenticate one another without a central authority. Our proposed scheme facilitates simultaneous multi-user authentication, significantly enhancing scalability and security in dynamic IoV networks. Results from realistic implementations show that our method achieves average authentication and verification times of 10.61 ms and 1.78 ms, respectively, for a fleet of 100 vehicles, outperforming existing methods. Scalability tests demonstrate efficient processing for larger groups of up to 500 vehicles, where average authentication times remain low, establishing our scheme as a robust solution for secure communication in IoV systems.

> This paper presents the first empirical study of a vulnerability detection and fix tool with professional software developers on real projects that they own. We implemented DeepVulGuard, an IDE-integrated tool based on state-of-the-art detection and fix models, and show that it has promising performance on benchmarks of historic vulnerability data. DeepVulGuard scans code for vulnerabilities (including identifying the vulnerability type and vulnerable region of code), suggests fixes, provides natural-language explanations for alerts and fixes, leveraging chat interfaces. We recruited 17 professional software developers at Microsoft, observed their usage of the tool on their code, and conducted interviews to assess the tool's usefulness, speed, trust, relevance, and workflow integration. We also gathered detailed qualitative feedback on users' perceptions and their desired features. Study participants scanned a total of 24 projects, 6.9k files, and over 1.7 million lines of source code, and generated 170 alerts and 50 fix suggestions. We find that although state-of-the-art AI-powered detection and fix tools show promise, they are not yet practical for real-world use due to a high rate of false positives and non-applicable fixes. User feedback reveals several actionable pain points, ranging from incomplete context to lack of customization for the user's codebase. Additionally, we explore how AI features, including confidence scores, explanations, and chat interaction, can apply to vulnerability detection and fixing. Based on these insights, we offer practical recommendations for evaluating and deploying AI detection and fix models. Our code and data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26367139.

> Despite the advanced capabilities of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, they remain vulnerable to adversarial and backdoor attacks. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in real-world deployments, where compromised models may exhibit unpredictable behavior in critical scenarios. Such risks are heightened by the prevalent practice of collecting massive, internet-sourced datasets for training multimodal models, as these datasets may harbor backdoors. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of backdooring in multimodal models, such as CleanCLIP, which is the current state-of-the-art approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficacy of CleanCLIP in mitigating backdoors is highly dependent on the particular objective used during model pre-training. We observe that stronger pre-training objectives that lead to higher zero-shot classification performance correlate with harder to remove backdoors behaviors. We show this by training multimodal models on two large datasets consisting of 3 million (CC3M) and 6 million (CC6M) datapoints, under various pre-training objectives, followed by poison removal using CleanCLIP. We find that CleanCLIP, even with extensive hyperparameter tuning, is ineffective in poison removal when stronger pre-training objectives are used. Our findings underscore critical considerations for ML practitioners who train models using large-scale web-curated data and are concerned about potential backdoor threats.

- *Shu Hong, Xiaojun Lin, Lingjie Duan*

- `2412.06120v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06120v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06120v2)

> Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training through model parameter exchanges instead of raw data. To avoid potential inference attacks from exchanged parameters, differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous guarantee against various attacks. However, conventional methods of ensuring DP by adding local noise alone often result in low training accuracy. Combining secure multi-party computation (SMPC) with DP, while improving the accuracy, incurs high communication and computation overheads as well as straggler vulnerability, in either client-to-server or client-to-client links. In this paper, we propose LightDP-FL, a novel lightweight scheme that ensures provable DP against untrusted peers and server, while maintaining straggler resilience, low overheads and high training accuracy. Our scheme incorporates both individual and pairwise noise into each client's parameter, which can be implemented with minimal overheads. Given the uncertain straggler and colluder sets, we utilize the upper bound on the numbers of stragglers and colluders to prove sufficient noise variance conditions to ensure DP in the worst case. Moreover, we optimize the expected convergence bound to ensure accuracy performance by flexibly controlling the noise variances. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, our experimental results demonstrate that LightDP-FL achieves faster convergence and stronger straggler resilience compared to baseline methods of the same DP level.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become invaluable intellectual property in graph-based machine learning. However, their vulnerability to model stealing attacks when deployed within Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) necessitates robust Ownership Demonstration (OD) techniques. Watermarking is a promising OD framework for Deep Neural Networks, but existing methods fail to generalize to GNNs due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data. Previous works on GNN watermarking have primarily focused on node and graph classification, overlooking Link Prediction (LP).   In this paper, we propose GENIE (watermarking Graph nEural Networks for lInk prEdiction), the first-ever scheme to watermark GNNs for LP. GENIE creates a novel backdoor for both node-representation and subgraph-based LP methods, utilizing a unique trigger set and a secret watermark vector. Our OD scheme is equipped with Dynamic Watermark Thresholding (DWT), ensuring high verification probability (>99.99%) while addressing practical issues in existing watermarking schemes. We extensively evaluate GENIE across 4 model architectures (i.e., SEAL, GCN, GraphSAGE and NeoGNN) and 7 real-world datasets. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of GENIE against 11 state-of-the-art watermark removal techniques and 3 model extraction attacks. We also show GENIE's resilience against ownership piracy attacks. Finally, we discuss a defense strategy to counter adaptive attacks against GENIE.

> Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple users to collaboratively train a global model in a distributed manner without revealing their personal data. However, FL remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject crafted updates to compromise the global model's accuracy. These vulnerabilities are particularly severe in non-homogeneous environments, where clients exhibit varying proportions of class labels, resulting in heterogeneous updates. In such settings, benign outliers are often misclassified as false positives, while maliciously crafted uploads evade detection and are aggregated at the server. Existing defense mechanisms struggle in such real-world settings, resulting in significant declines in the global FL model's performance.   We propose a novel defense mechanism, Kernel-based Trust Segmentation (KeTS), to counter model poisoning attacks. Unlike existing approaches, KeTS analyzes the evolution of each client's updates and effectively segments malicious clients using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), even in the presence of benign outliers. We thoroughly evaluate KeTS's performance against the six most effective model poisoning attacks (i.e., Trim-Attack, Krum-Attack, Min-Max attack, Min-Sum attack, and their variants) on two different datasets (i.e., MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) and compare its performance with three classical robust schemes (i.e., Krum, Trim-Mean, and Median) and a state-of-the-art defense (i.e., FLTrust). Our results show that KeTS outperforms the existing defenses in every attack setting; beating the best-performing defense by an overall average of >24% (on MNIST) and >14% (on Fashion-MNIST). A series of further experiments (varying poisoning approaches, attacker population, etc.) reveal the consistent and superior performance of KeTS under diverse conditions.

> This study reveals the vulnerabilities of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) sensing, under the scope of joint communication and sensing (JCAS), focusing on target spoofing and deceptive jamming techniques. We use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to explore how adversaries can exploit WLAN's sensing capabilities to inject false targets and disrupt normal operations. Unlike traditional methods that require sophisticated digital radio-frequency memory hardware, we demonstrate that much simpler software-defined radios can effectively serve as deceptive jammers in WLAN settings. Through comprehensive modeling and practical experiments, we show how deceptive jammers can manipulate the range-Doppler map (RDM) by altering signal integrity, thereby posing significant security threats to OFDM-based JCAS systems. Our findings comprehensively evaluate jammer impact on RDMs and propose several jamming strategies that vary in complexity and detectability.

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. However, these systems remain vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that can significantly degrade LLM performance through the injection of malicious content. To address these challenges, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters compromised and irrelevant contents before they are retrieved for generation. Our approach implements a two-stage defense mechanism: At the first stage, it employs K-means clustering to identify potential attack patterns in retrieved documents using cosine similarity and ROUGE metrics as guidance, effectively isolating suspicious content. Secondly, it performs a self-assessment which detects malicious documents and resolves discrepancies between the model's internal knowledge and external information. TrustRAG functions as a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any language model, whether open or closed-source. In addition, TrustRAG maintains high contextual relevance while strengthening defenses against corpus poisoning attacks. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance compared to existing approaches across multiple model architectures and datasets. We have made TrustRAG available as open-source software at \url{https://github.com/HuichiZhou/TrustRAG}.

> Quantum computing is an emerging field with significant potential, yet software development and maintenance challenges limit its accessibility and maturity. This work investigates the current state, evolution, and maintenance practices in the quantum computing community by conducting a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 quantum software repositories on GitHub, containing more than 1.2 million commits contributed by over 10,000 unique developers. Specifically, the focus of this paper is to: (i) assess the community's status and growth by examining the popularity of quantum computing, trends in programming languages and framework usage, growth of contributors, and insights from repository documentation; and (ii) analyze maintenance practices through commit patterns, issue classification, and maintenance levels. Our findings indicate rapid growth in the quantum computing community, with a 200% increase in the number of repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Our analysis of commits shows a strong focus on perfective updates, while the relatively low number of corrective commits highlights potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, one-third of the quantum computing issues highlight the need for specialized tools in addition to general software infrastructure. In summary, this work provides a foundation for targeted improvements in quantum software to support sustained growth and technical advancement. Based on our analysis of development activity, community structure, and maintenance practices, this study offers actionable recommendations to enhance quantum programming tools, documentation, and resources. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

Although it boasts enhanced security over traditional networks, the quantum internet still encounters unique security challenges essential for safeguarding its Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). This study explores these challenges by analyzing the vulnerabilities and the corresponding mitigation strategies across different layers of the quantum internet, including physical, link, network, and application layers. We assess the severity of potential attacks, evaluate the expected effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and identify vulnerabilities within diverse network configurations, integrating both classical and quantum approaches. Our research highlights the dynamic nature of these security issues and emphasizes the necessity for adaptive security measures. The findings underline the need for ongoing research into the security dimension of the quantum internet to ensure its robustness, encourage its adoption, and maximize its impact on society.

- `2501.07028v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07028v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07028v1)

> Due to the current standard of Security Credential Management System (SCMS) for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications using asymmetric cryptography, specifically Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC), which may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Therefore, the V2X SCMS is threatened by quantum computing attacks. However, although the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already selected Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms as the standard, the current PQC algorithms may have issues such as longer public key lengths, longer signature lengths, or lower signature generation and verification efficiency, which may not fully meet the requirements of V2X communication applications. In view of the challenges in V2X communication, such as packet length, signature generation and verification efficiency, security level, and vehicle privacy, this study proposes a hybrid certificate scheme of PQC and ECC. By leveraging the strengths of both PQC and ECC, this scheme aims to overcome the challenges in V2X communication. PQC is used to establish a security level resistant to quantum computing attacks, while ECC is utilized to establish anonymous certificates and reduce packet length to meet the requirements of V2X communication. In the practical experiments, the study implemented the SCMS end entity based on the Chunghwa Telecom SCMS and the Clientron On-Board Unit (OBU) to conduct field tests in Danhai New Town in New Taipei City. The performance of various existing hybrid certificate schemes combining PQC (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+) and ECC is compared, and a practical solution is provided for V2X industries.

Experimental results show that HADES can effectively jailbreak existing MLLMs, which achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 90.26% for LLaVA-1.5 and 71.60% for Gemini Pro Vision.

> Transformer models have excelled in natural language tasks, prompting the vision community to explore their implementation in computer vision problems. However, these models are still influenced by adversarial examples. In this paper, we investigate the attack capabilities of six common adversarial attacks on three pretrained ViT models to reveal the vulnerability of ViT models. To understand and analyse the bias in neural network decisions when the input is adversarial, we use two visualisation techniques that are attention rollout and grad attention rollout. To prevent ViT models from adversarial attack, we propose Protego, a detection framework that leverages the transformer intrinsic capabilities to detection adversarial examples of ViT models. Nonetheless, this is challenging due to a diversity of attack strategies that may be adopted by adversaries. Inspired by the attention mechanism, we know that the token of prediction contains all the information from the input sample. Additionally, the attention region for adversarial examples differs from that of normal examples. Given these points, we can train a detector that achieves superior performance than existing detection methods to identify adversarial examples. Our experiments have demonstrated the high effectiveness of our detection method. For these six adversarial attack methods, our detector's AUC scores all exceed 0.95. Protego may advance investigations in metaverse security.

> Smart contract vulnerabilities caused significant economic losses in blockchain applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for addressing this time-consuming task. However, state-of-the-art LLM-based detection solutions are often plagued by high false-positive rates.   In this paper, we push the boundaries of existing research in two key ways. First, our evaluation is based on Solidity v0.8, offering the most up-to-date insights compared to prior studies that focus on older versions (v0.4). Second, we leverage the latest five LLM models (across companies), ensuring comprehensive coverage across the most advanced capabilities in the field.   We conducted a series of rigorous evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that a well-designed prompt can reduce the false-positive rate by over 60%. Surprisingly, we also discovered that the recall rate for detecting some specific vulnerabilities in Solidity v0.8 has dropped to just 13% compared to earlier versions (i.e., v0.4). Further analysis reveals the root cause of this decline: the reliance of LLMs on identifying changes in newly introduced libraries and frameworks during detection.

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various tasks, including those requiring human-level intelligence, such as vulnerability detection. However, recent efforts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection remain preliminary, as they lack a deep understanding of whether a subject LLM's vulnerability reasoning capability stems from the model itself or from external aids such as knowledge retrieval and tooling support.   In this paper, we aim to decouple LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from other capabilities, such as vulnerability knowledge adoption, context information retrieval, and advanced prompt schemes. We introduce LLM4Vuln, a unified evaluation framework that separates and assesses LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities and examines improvements when combined with other enhancements.   We conduct controlled experiments using 147 ground-truth vulnerabilities and 147 non-vulnerable cases in Solidity, Java and C/C++, testing them in a total of 3,528 scenarios across four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Phi-3, and Llama 3). Our findings reveal the varying impacts of knowledge enhancement, context supplementation, and prompt schemes. We also identify 14 zero-day vulnerabilities in four pilot bug bounty programs, resulting in $3,576 in bounties.

Unfortunately, such an essential framework is not available for the OpenHarmony community yet. Existing program analysis methods have several problems when handling the ArkTS code. To bridge the gap, we design and implement a framework named ArkAnalyzer and make it publicly available as an open-source project. Our ArkAnalyzer addresses the aforementioned problems and has already integrated a number of fundamental static analysis functions that are ready to be reused by developers to implement OpenHarmony

> Threat analysis is continuously growing in importance due to the always-increasing complexity and frequency of cyber attacks. Analyzing threats demands significant effort from security experts, leading to delays in the security analysis process. Different cybersecurity knowledge bases are currently available to support this task but manual efforts are often required to correlate such heterogenous sources into a unified view that would enable a more comprehensive assessment. To address this gap, we propose a methodology leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to effectively and efficiently associate Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) vulnerabilities with Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) attack patterns. The proposed technique combines semantic similarity with keyword analysis to improve the accuracy of association estimations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models, reducing manual effort and analysis time, and enabling cybersecurity professionals to prioritize critical tasks.

- `2405.07533v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07533v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07533v4)

> Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

> Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to LLMs form Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.

> State machines play a pivotal role in augmenting the efficacy of protocol analyzing to unveil more vulnerabilities. However, inferring state machines from network protocol implementations presents significant challenges, mainly because of the complicated code syntax and semantics. Traditional methods based on dynamic analysis often overlook crucial state transitions due to limited coverage, while static analysis suffers from path explosion facing to protocol implementations. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative state machine inference approach powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) named ProtocolGPT. Utilizing retrieval augmented generation technology, this method augments pre-trained model with specific knowledge drawn from protocol implementations. Through targeted prompt engineering, we systematically identify and infer the underlying state machines. Our evaluation across six protocol implementations demonstrates the method's high efficacy, achieving precision exceeding 90% and successfully delineating differences on state machines among various implementations of the same protocol. Integrating our approach with protocol fuzzing significantly improves fuzzers by more than 20% in terms of coverage and detects two zero-day vulnerabilities compared to the baseline. Our proposed method represents a major advancement in accurate state machine inference and highlights the substantial potential of LLMs in enhancing network protocol security analysis.

> Machine Learning (ML) models have become a very powerful tool to extract information from large datasets and use it to make accurate predictions and automated decisions. However, ML models can be vulnerable to external attacks, causing them to underperform or deviate from their expected tasks. One way to attack ML models is by injecting malicious data to mislead the algorithm during the training phase, which is referred to as a poisoning attack. We can prepare for such situations by designing anticipated attacks, which are later used for creating and testing defence strategies. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to generate strong poisoning attacks for a ridge regression model containing both numerical and categorical features that explicitly models and poisons categorical features. We model categorical features as SOS-1 sets and formulate the problem of designing poisoning attacks as a bilevel optimization problem that is nonconvex mixed-integer in the upper-level and unconstrained convex quadratic in the lower-level. We present the mathematical formulation of the problem, introduce a single-level reformulation based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the lower level, find bounds for the lower-level variables to accelerate solver performance, and propose a new algorithm to poison categorical features. Numerical experiments show that our method improves the mean squared error of all datasets compared to the previous benchmark in the literature.

> The o1 system card identifies the o1 models as the most robust within OpenAI, with their defining characteristic being the progression from rapid, intuitive thinking to slower, more deliberate reasoning. This observation motivated us to investigate the influence of System-2 thinking patterns on model safety. In our preliminary research, we conducted safety evaluations of the o1 model, including complex jailbreak attack scenarios using adversarial natural language prompts and mathematical encoding prompts. Our findings indicate that the o1 model demonstrates relatively improved safety performance; however, it still exhibits vulnerabilities, particularly against jailbreak attacks employing mathematical encoding. Through detailed case analysis, we identified specific patterns in the o1 model's responses. We also explored the alignment of System-2 safety in open-source models using prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning techniques. Experimental results show that some simple methods to encourage the model to carefully scrutinize user requests are beneficial for model safety. Additionally, we proposed a implementation plan for process supervision to enhance safety alignment. The implementation details and experimental results will be provided in future versions.

> There is an expectation that users of home IoT devices will be able to secure those devices, but they may lack information about what they need to do. In February 2022, we launched a web service that scans users' IoT devices to determine how secure they are. The service aims to diagnose and remediate vulnerabilities and malware infections of IoT devices of Japanese users. This paper reports on findings from operating this service drawn from three studies: (1) the engagement of 114,747 users between February, 2022 - May, 2024; (2) a large-scale evaluation survey among service users (n=4,103), and; (3) an investigation and targeted survey (n=90) around the remediation actions of users of non-secure devices. During the operation, we notified 417 (0.36%) users that one or more of their devices were detected as vulnerable, and 171 (0.15%) users that one of their devices was infected with malware. The service found no issues for 99% of users. Still, 96% of all users evaluated the service positively, most often for it providing reassurance, being free of charge, and short diagnosis time. Of the 171 users with malware infections, 67 returned to the service later for a new check, with 59 showing improvement. Of the 417 users with vulnerable devices, 151 users revisited and re-diagnosed, where 75 showed improvement. We report on lessons learned, including a consideration of the capabilities that non-expert users will assume of a security scan.

> Software vulnerabilities pose critical security risks, demanding prompt and effective mitigation strategies. While advancements in Automated Program Repair (APR) have primarily targeted general software bugs, the domain of vulnerability patching, which is a security-critical subset of APR, remains underexplored. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained language models, CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across diverse datasets and five programming languages. We evaluate these models on their accuracy, computational efficiency, and how the length of vulnerable code patches impacts performance. Our findings reveal promising accuracy levels, particularly for CodeT5 on datasets with complex vulnerability patterns, while CodeBERT demonstrates strengths in handling fragmented or context-limited datasets. CodeT5 further showcases superior efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. However, both models face challenges in maintaining performance as patch length increases, highlighting the complexity of addressing extended in program repair specifically aimed at fixing vulnerabilities. This study benchmarks model performance, highlights key limitations, and offers insights to improve automated vulnerability patching for practical security applications.

> Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety disorders affect millions globally, contributing significantly to the burden of mental health issues. Early screening is crucial for effective intervention, as timely identification of mental health issues can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable for improving the screening of mental disorders, enabling early intervention and better treatment outcomes. AI-driven screening can leverage the analysis of multiple data sources, including facial features in digital images. However, existing methods often rely on controlled environments or specialized equipment, limiting their broad applicability. This study explores the potential of AI models for ubiquitous depression-anxiety screening given face-centric selfies. The investigation focuses on high-risk pregnant patients, a population that is particularly vulnerable to mental health issues. To cope with limited training data resulting from our clinical setup, pre-trained models were utilized in two different approaches: fine-tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) originally designed for facial expression recognition and employing vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of facial expressions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed VLM-based method significantly outperforms CNNs, achieving an accuracy of 77.6%. Although there is significant room for improvement, the results suggest that VLMs can be a promising approach for mental health screening.

> N-Version Programming is a well-known methodology for developing fault-tolerant systems. It achieves fault detection and correction at runtime by adding diverse redundancy into programs, minimizing fault mode overlap between redundant program variants. In this work, we propose the automated generation of program variants using large language models. We design, develop and evaluate Gal\'apagos: a tool for generating program variants using LLMs, validating their correctness and equivalence, and using them to assemble N-Version binaries. We evaluate Gal\'apagos by creating N-Version components of real-world C code. Our original results show that Gal\'apagos can produce program variants that are proven to be functionally equivalent, even when the variants are written in a different programming language. Our systematic diversity measurement indicates that functionally equivalent variants produced by Gal\'apagos, are statically different after compilation, and present diverging internal behavior at runtime. We demonstrate that the variants produced by Gal\'apagos can protect C code against real miscompilation bugs which affect the Clang compiler. Overall, our paper shows that producing N-Version software can be drastically automated by advanced usage of practical formal verification and generative language models.

> We present LitmusKt - the first tool for litmus testing concurrent programs in Kotlin. The tool's novelty also lies in the fact that Kotlin is a multiplatform language, i.e., it compiles into multiple platforms, which means that the concurrency has to be tested on several of them. Our tool allows writing litmus tests in a single custom DSL, and these tests are then run in Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JVM, two main platforms for concurrent programming in Kotlin. Using LitmusKt, we discovered novel bugs in the Kotlin compiler, which we then fixed and they are no longer present. Moreover, LitmusKt was integrated into the CI pipeline for Kotlin. We believe that our tool is valuable for further studying concurrency in Kotlin and other multiplatform languages, as well as for further developing the Kotlin memory model.   LitmusKt is openly available on GitHub: https://github.com/Jetbrains-Research/litmuskt. The demonstration video is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/gXI0aYJDnRw.

> It is now common to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) by having humans manually vote to evaluate model outputs, in contrast to typical benchmarks that evaluate knowledge or skill at some particular task. Chatbot Arena, the most popular benchmark of this type, ranks models by asking users to select the better response between two randomly selected models (without revealing which model was responsible for the generations). These platforms are widely trusted as a fair and accurate measure of LLM capabilities. In this paper, we show that if bot protection and other defenses are not implemented, these voting-based benchmarks are potentially vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. Specifically, we show that an attacker can alter the leaderboard (to promote their favorite model or demote competitors) at the cost of roughly a thousand votes (verified in a simulated, offline version of Chatbot Arena). Our attack consists of two steps: first, we show how an attacker can determine which model was used to generate a given reply with more than $95\%$ accuracy; and then, the attacker can use this information to consistently vote for (or against) a target model. Working with the Chatbot Arena developers, we identify, propose, and implement mitigations to improve the robustness of Chatbot Arena against adversarial manipulation, which, based on our analysis, substantially increases the cost of such attacks. Some of these defenses were present before our collaboration, such as bot protection with Cloudflare, malicious user detection, and rate limiting. Others, including reCAPTCHA and login are being integrated to strengthen the security in Chatbot Arena.

> The increasing use of voice assistants and related applications has raised significant concerns about the security of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in smartphones. These devices are vulnerable to acoustic eavesdropping attacks, jeopardizing user privacy. In response, Google imposed a rate limit of 200 Hz on permission-free access to IMUs, aiming to neutralize such side-channel attacks. Our research introduces a novel exploit, STAG, which circumvents these protections. It induces a temporal misalignment between the gyroscope and accelerometer, cleverly combining their data to resample at higher rates and reviving the potential for eavesdropping attacks previously curtailed by Google's security enhancements. Compared to prior methods, STAG achieves an 83.4% reduction in word error rate, highlighting its effectiveness in exploiting IMU data under restricted access and emphasizing the persistent security risks associated with these sensors.

> Agent-based program repair offers to automatically resolve complex bugs end-to-end by combining the planning, tool use, and code generation abilities of modern LLMs. Recent work has explored the use of agent-based repair approaches on the popular open-source SWE-Bench, a collection of bugs from highly-rated GitHub Python projects. In addition, various agentic approaches such as SWE-Agent have been proposed to solve bugs in this benchmark. This paper explores the viability of using an agentic approach to address bugs in an enterprise context. To investigate this, we curate an evaluation set of 178 bugs drawn from Google's issue tracking system. This dataset spans both human-reported (78) and machine-reported bugs (100).   To establish a repair performance baseline on this benchmark, we implement Passerine, an agent similar in spirit to SWE-Agent that can work within Google's development environment. We show that with 20 trajectory samples and Gemini 1.5 Pro, Passerine can produce a patch that passes bug tests (i.e., plausible) for 73% of machine-reported and 25.6% of human-reported bugs in our evaluation set. After manual examination, we found that 43% of machine-reported bugs and 17.9% of human-reported bugs have at least one patch that is semantically equivalent to the ground-truth patch.   These results establish a baseline on an industrially relevant benchmark, which as we show, contains bugs drawn from a different distribution -- in terms of language diversity, size, and spread of changes, etc. -- compared to those in the popular SWE-Bench dataset.

> Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern software systems, interfacing between the user and the Internet to assist with tasks that require advanced language understanding. To accomplish these tasks, the LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval, results from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to manipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be injected into external data sources to override the system's intended instruction and instead execute a malicious instruction.   To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a new defense called SecAlign based on the technique of preference optimization. Our defense first constructs a preference dataset with prompt-injected inputs, secure outputs (ones that respond to the legitimate instruction), and insecure outputs (ones that respond to the injection). We then perform preference optimization on this dataset to teach the LLM to prefer the secure output over the insecure one. This provides the first known method that reduces the success rates of various prompt injections to around 0%, even against attacks much more sophisticated than ones seen during training. This indicates our defense generalizes well against unknown and yet-to-come attacks. Also, our defended models are still practical with similar utility to the one before our defensive training.

This literature review examines the vulnerabilities of IoMT devices, focusing on critical threats and exploring mitigation strategies. We conducted a comprehensive search across leading databases such as ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Elsevier to analyze peer-reviewed studies published within the last five years (from 2019 to 2024). The review shows that inadequate encryption protocols, weak authentication methods, and irregular firmware updates are the main causes of risks associated with IoMT devices. We have identified emerging solutions like machine learning algorithms, blockchain technology, and edge computing as promising approaches to enhance IoMT security. This review emphasizes the pressing need to develop lightweight security measures and standardized protocols to protect patient data and ensure the integrity of healthcare services.

> Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., small input perturbations can significantly affect the outputs of a neural network. Therefore, to ensure safety of safety-critical environments, the robustness of a neural network must be formally verified against input perturbations, e.g., from noisy sensors. To improve the robustness of neural networks and thus simplify the formal verification, we present a novel set-based training procedure in which we compute the set of possible outputs given the set of possible inputs and compute for the first time a gradient set, i.e., each possible output has a different gradient. Therefore, we can directly reduce the size of the output enclosure by choosing gradients toward its center. Small output enclosures increase the robustness of a neural network and, at the same time, simplify its formal verification. The latter benefit is due to the fact that a larger size of propagated sets increases the conservatism of most verification methods. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that set-based training produces robust neural networks with competitive performance, which can be verified using fast (polynomial-time) verification algorithms due to the reduced output set.

> Recently, several works have been conducted on jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot malicious demos. In particular, Zheng et al. (2024) focuses on improving the efficiency of Few-Shot Jailbreaking (FSJ) by injecting special tokens into the demos and employing demo-level random search. Nevertheless, this method lacks generality since it specifies the instruction-response structure. Moreover, the reason why inserting special tokens takes effect in inducing harmful behaviors is only empirically discussed. In this paper, we take a deeper insight into the mechanism of special token injection and propose Self-Instruct Few-Shot Jailbreaking (Self-Instruct-FSJ) facilitated with the demo-level greedy search. This framework decomposes the FSJ attack into pattern and behavior learning to exploit the model's vulnerabilities in a more generalized and efficient way. We conduct elaborate experiments to evaluate our method on common open-source models and compare it with baseline algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/iphosi/Self-Instruct-FSJ.

One of the common approaches to address privacy-related issues in DL is to adopt distributed learning such as federated learning (FL), where private raw data is not shared among users. Despite the privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL, it still faces challenges in trustworthiness. Specifically, the malicious users, during training, can systematically create malicious model parameters to compromise the models predictive and generative capabilities, resulting in high uncertainty about their reliability. To demonstrate malicious behaviour, we propose a novel model poisoning attack method named Delphi which aims to maximise the uncertainty of the global model output. We achieve this by taking advantage of the relationship between the uncertainty and the model parameters of the first hidden layer of the local model. Delphi employs two types of optimisation , Bayesian Optimisation and Least Squares Trust Region, to search for the optimal poisoned model parameters, named as Delphi-BO and Delphi-LSTR. We quantify the uncertainty using the KL Divergence to minimise the distance of the predictive probability distribution towards an uncertain distribution of model output. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical proof for the attack effectiveness demonstrated in FL. Numerical results demonstrate that Delphi-BO induces a higher amount of uncertainty than Delphi-LSTR highlighting vulnerability of FL systems to model poisoning attacks.

- *Abhinav Das, Stephan Schlüter, Lorenz Schneider*

- `2412.00123v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00123v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00123v3)

> This paper presents a new hybrid model for predicting German electricity prices. The algorithm is based on combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). While GPR is a competent model for learning the stochastic pattern within the data and interpolation, its performance for out-of-sample data is not very promising. By choosing a suitable data-dependent covariance function, we can enhance the performance of GPR for the tested German hourly power prices. However, since the out-of-sample prediction depends on the training data, the prediction is vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome this issue, a separate prediction is made using SVR, which applies margin-based optimization, having an advantage in dealing with non-linear processes and outliers, since only certain necessary points (support vectors) in the training data are responsible for regression. Both individual predictions are later combined using the performance-based weight assignment method. A test on historic German power prices shows that this approach outperforms its chosen benchmarks such as the autoregressive exogenous model, the naive approach, as well as the long short-term memory approach of prediction.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly aided developers by generating or assisting in code writing, enhancing productivity across various tasks. While identifying incorrect code is often straightforward, detecting vulnerabilities in functionally correct code is more challenging, especially for developers with limited security knowledge, which poses considerable security risks of using LLM-generated code and underscores the need for robust evaluation benchmarks that assess both functional correctness and security. Current benchmarks like CyberSecEval and SecurityEval attempt to solve it but are hindered by unclear and impractical specifications, failing to assess both functionality and security accurately. To tackle these deficiencies, we introduce CWEval, a novel outcome-driven evaluation framework designed to enhance the evaluation of secure code generation by LLMs. This framework not only assesses code functionality but also its security simultaneously with high-quality task specifications and outcome-driven test oracles which provides high accuracy. Coupled with CWEval-bench, a multilingual, security-critical coding benchmark, CWEval provides a rigorous empirical security evaluation on LLM-generated code, overcoming previous benchmarks' shortcomings. Through our evaluations, CWEval reveals a notable portion of functional but insecure code produced by LLMs, and shows a serious inaccuracy of previous evaluations, ultimately contributing significantly to the field of secure code generation. We open-source our artifact at: https://github.com/Co1lin/CWEval .

> While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in math problem-solving tasks, their robustness to noisy inputs is not well-studied. In this work, we propose ArithmAttack to examine how robust the LLMs are when they encounter noisy prompts that contain extra noise in the form of punctuation marks. While being easy to implement, ArithmAttack does not cause any information loss since words are not added or deleted from the context. We evaluate the robustness of seven LLMs, including LLama3, Mistral, and Mathstral, on noisy GSM8K and MultiArith datasets. Our experiments suggest that all the studied models show vulnerability to such noise, with more noise leading to poorer performances.

> Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers significant potential for complex tasks like genome sequence classification, but quantum noise on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses practical challenges. This study systematically evaluates how various quantum noise models including dephasing, amplitude damping, depolarizing, thermal noise, bit-flip, and phase-flip affect key QML algorithms (QSVC, Peg-QSVC, QNN, VQC) and feature mapping techniques (ZFeatureMap, ZZFeatureMap, and PauliFeatureMap). Results indicate that QSVC is notably robust under noise, whereas Peg-QSVC and QNN are more sensitive, particularly to depolarizing and amplitude-damping noise. The PauliFeatureMap is especially vulnerable, highlighting difficulties in maintaining accurate classification under noisy conditions. These findings underscore the critical importance of feature map selection and noise mitigation strategies in optimizing QML for genomic classification, with promising implications for personalized medicine.

> With the advent of decentralised digital currencies powered by blockchain technology, a new era of peer-to-peer transactions has commenced. The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency economy has led to increased use of transaction-enabling wallets, making them a focal point for security risks. As the frequency of wallet-related incidents rises, there is a critical need for a systematic approach to measure and evaluate these attacks, drawing lessons from past incidents to enhance wallet security. In response, we introduce a multi-dimensional design taxonomy for existing and novel wallets with various design decisions. We classify existing industry wallets based on this taxonomy, identify previously occurring vulnerabilities and discuss the security implications of design decisions. We also systematise threats to the wallet mechanism and analyse the adversary's goals, capabilities and required knowledge. We present a multi-layered attack framework and investigate 84 incidents between 2012 and 2024, accounting for $5.4B. Following this, we classify defence implementations for these attacks on the precautionary and remedial axes. We map the mechanism and design decisions to vulnerabilities, attacks, and possible defence methods to discuss various insights.

- `2501.08246v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08246v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08246v1)

> Recent work has proposed automated red-teaming methods for testing the vulnerabilities of a given target large language model (LLM). These methods use red-teaming LLMs to uncover inputs that induce harmful behavior in a target LLM. In this paper, we study red-teaming strategies that enable a targeted security assessment. We propose an optimization framework for red-teaming with proximity constraints, where the discovered prompts must be similar to reference prompts from a given dataset. This dataset serves as a template for the discovered prompts, anchoring the search for test-cases to specific topics, writing styles, or types of harmful behavior. We show that established auto-regressive model architectures do not perform well in this setting. We therefore introduce a black-box red-teaming method inspired by text-diffusion models: Diffusion for Auditing and Red-Teaming (DART). DART modifies the reference prompt by perturbing it in the embedding space, directly controlling the amount of change introduced. We systematically evaluate our method by comparing its effectiveness with established methods based on model fine-tuning and zero- and few-shot prompting. Our results show that DART is significantly more effective at discovering harmful inputs in close proximity to the reference prompt.

To the best of our knowledge, no realistic and performant driver has been verified for a non-trivial device. We propose Pancake, an imperative language for systems programming that features a well-defined and verification-friendly semantics. Leveraging the verified compiler backend of the CakeML functional language, we develop a compiler for Pancake that guarantees that the binary retains the semantics of the source code. Usng automatic translation of Pancake to the Viper SMT front-end, we verify a performant driver for an Ethernet NIC.

> Face recognition technologies are increasingly used in various applications, yet they are vulnerable to face spoofing attacks. These spoofing attacks often involve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens. Although stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, their high-cost limits their widespread adoption. Conversely, two-sensor systems without extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable to calculate depth using stereo techniques. In this work, we propose a method to overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparity information and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, using non-calibrated systems. We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coined Disparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modality alongside the two original sensor modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using a comprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455. Our method outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 1%. These errors are lower by 2.45% and 7.94% than the errors of the best comparison method, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a model ensemble that addresses 3D spoof attacks as well, achieving an EER of 2.04% and an FNR of 3.83% at an FPR of 1%. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of anti-spoofing in non-calibrated systems that lack depth information.

> Reliance on anonymity in social media has increased its popularity on these platforms among all ages. The availability of public Wi-Fi networks has facilitated a vast variety of online content, including social media applications. Although anonymity and ease of access can be a convenient means of communication for their users, it is difficult to manage and protect its vulnerable users against sexual predators. Using an automated identification system that can attribute predators to their text would make the solution more attainable. In this survey, we provide a review of the methods of pedophile attribution used in social media platforms. We examine the effect of the size of the suspect set and the length of the text on the task of attribution. Moreover, we review the most-used datasets, features, classification techniques and performance measures for attributing sexual predators. We found that few studies have proposed tools to mitigate the risk of online sexual predators, but none of them can provide suspect attribution. Finally, we list several open research problems.

> Internship and industry-affiliated capstone projects are popular ways to expose students to real world experiences and bridge the gap between academic training and industry requirements. However, these two approaches often require active industry collaboration, and many students struggle to find industry placements. Open-source contributions are a crucial alternative to gain real world experience, earn publicly verifiable contribution with real-world impact, and learn from experienced open-source contributors. The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global initiative that matches students or new contributors with experienced mentors to work on open-source projects. The program aims to introduce the students to open-source development, help them gain valuable skills under the guidance of mentors, and hopefully encourage them to continue contributing to open-source projects. The realization of the program objectives will provide a continuous pool of talented new contributors necessary for maintaining open-source projects. This study presents an empirical analysis of pull requests created by interns during the GSoC program. We extracted and analyzed 17,232 pull requests from 2,456 interns across 1,937 open-source projects. The results show most tasks involve both code-intensive activities like adding new features and fixing bugs, as well as non-code tasks like updating documentation and restructuring the codebase. Feedback from reviewers covers code functionality and programming logic, testing coverage, error handling, code readability, and adherence to best practices. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for software engineering education.

> Recent studies have revealed that modern image and video quality assessment (IQA/VQA) metrics are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. An attacker can manipulate a video through preprocessing to artificially increase its quality score according to a certain metric, despite no actual improvement in visual quality. Most of the attacks studied in the literature are white-box attacks, while black-box attacks in the context of VQA have received less attention. Moreover, some research indicates a lack of transferability of adversarial examples generated for one model to another when applied to VQA. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal attack method, IC2VQA, aimed at exploring the vulnerabilities of modern VQA models. This approach is motivated by the observation that the low-level feature spaces of images and videos are similar. We investigate the transferability of adversarial perturbations across different modalities; specifically, we analyze how adversarial perturbations generated on a white-box IQA model with an additional CLIP module can effectively target a VQA model. The addition of the CLIP module serves as a valuable aid in increasing transferability, as the CLIP model is known for its effective capture of low-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC2VQA achieves a high success rate in attacking three black-box VQA models. We compare our method with existing black-box attack strategies, highlighting its superiority in terms of attack success within the same number of iterations and levels of attack strength. We believe that the proposed method will contribute to the deeper analysis of robust VQA metrics.

> Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) facilitates collaborative machine learning without the need for participants to share raw private data. However, recent studies have revealed privacy risks where adversaries might reconstruct sensitive features through data leakage during the learning process. Although data reconstruction methods based on gradient or model information are somewhat effective, they reveal limitations in VFL application scenarios. This is because these traditional methods heavily rely on specific model structures and/or have strict limitations on application scenarios. To address this, our study introduces the Unified InverNet Framework into VFL, which yields a novel and flexible approach (dubbed UIFV) that leverages intermediate feature data to reconstruct original data, instead of relying on gradients or model details. The intermediate feature data is the feature exchanged by different participants during the inference phase of VFL. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques in attack precision. Our work exposes severe privacy vulnerabilities within VFL systems that pose real threats to practical VFL applications and thus confirms the necessity of further enhancing privacy protection in the VFL architecture.

> The rapid advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced capabilities offering potential applications from content creation to productivity enhancement. Despite their innovative potential, LVLMs exhibit vulnerabilities, especially in generating potentially toxic or unsafe responses. Malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to propagate toxic content in an automated (or semi-) manner, leveraging the susceptibility of LVLMs to deception via strategically crafted prompts without fine-tuning or compute-intensive procedures. Despite the red-teaming efforts and inherent potential risks associated with the LVLMs, exploring vulnerabilities of LVLMs remains nascent and yet to be fully addressed in a systematic manner. This study systematically examines the vulnerabilities of open-source LVLMs, including LLaVA, InstructBLIP, Fuyu, and Qwen, using adversarial prompt strategies that simulate real-world social manipulation tactics informed by social theories. Our findings show that (i) toxicity and insulting are the most prevalent behaviors, with the mean rates of 16.13% and 9.75%, respectively; (ii) Qwen-VL-Chat, LLaVA-v1.6-Vicuna-7b, and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7b are the most vulnerable models, exhibiting toxic response rates of 21.50%, 18.30% and 17.90%, and insulting responses of 13.40%, 11.70% and 10.10%, respectively; (iii) prompting strategies incorporating dark humor and multimodal toxic prompt completion significantly elevated these vulnerabilities. Despite being fine-tuned for safety, these models still generate content with varying degrees of toxicity when prompted with adversarial inputs, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms and robust guardrails in LVLM development.

> We collect novel data in the public service domain to evaluate the capability of the state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models in capturing regional differences in accents in the United Kingdom (UK), specifically focusing on two accents from Scotland with distinct dialects. This study addresses real-world problems where biased ASR models can lead to miscommunication in public services, disadvantaging individuals with regional accents particularly those in vulnerable populations. We first examine the out-of-the-box performance of the Whisper large-v3 model on a baseline dataset and our data. We then explore the impact of fine-tuning Whisper on the performance in the two UK regions and investigate the effectiveness of existing model evaluation techniques for our real-world application through manual inspection of model errors. We observe that the Whisper model has a higher word error rate (WER) on our test datasets compared to the baseline data and fine-tuning on a given data improves performance on the test dataset with the same domain and accent. The fine-tuned models also appear to show improved performance when applied to the test data outside of the region it was trained on suggesting that fine-tuned models may be transferable within parts of the UK. Our manual analysis of model outputs reveals the benefits and drawbacks of using WER as an evaluation metric and fine-tuning to adapt to regional dialects.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) and pre-trained Language Models (LMs) have achieved impressive success on many software engineering tasks (e.g., code completion and code generation). By leveraging huge existing code corpora (e.g., GitHub), these models can understand the patterns in source code and use these patterns to predict code properties. However, LLMs under few-shot learning perform poorly on non-generative tasks (e.g., fault localization and vulnerability localization), and fine-tuning LLMs is time-consuming and costly for end users and small organizations. Furthermore, the performance of fine-tuning LMs for non-generative tasks is impressive, yet it heavily depends on the amount and quality of data. As a result, the current lack of data and the high cost of collecting it in real-world scenarios further limit the applicability of LMs. In this paper, we leverage the powerful generation capabilities of LLMs to enhance pre-trained LMs. Specifically, we use LLMs to generate domain-specific data, thereby improving the performance of pre-trained LMs on the target tasks. We conduct experiments by combining different LLMs in our generation phase and introducing various LMs to learn from the LLM-generated data. Then, we compare the performance of these LMs before and after learning the data. We find that LLM-generated data significantly enhances the performance of LMs. The improvement can reach up to 58.36% for fault localization and up to 6.09% for clone detection.

> Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate method identification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, \system{} constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance, achieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable types, and 80.65% for contract attributes.

> As we transition from Narrow Artificial Intelligence towards Artificial Super Intelligence, users are increasingly concerned about their privacy and the trustworthiness of machine learning (ML) technology. A common denominator for the metrics of trustworthiness is the quantification of uncertainty inherent in DL algorithms, and specifically in the model parameters, input data, and model predictions. One of the common approaches to address privacy-related issues in DL is to adopt distributed learning such as federated learning (FL), where private raw data is not shared among users. Despite the privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL, it still faces challenges in trustworthiness. Specifically, the malicious users, during training, can systematically create malicious model parameters to compromise the models predictive and generative capabilities, resulting in high uncertainty about their reliability. To demonstrate malicious behaviour, we propose a novel model poisoning attack method named Delphi which aims to maximise the uncertainty of the global model output. We achieve this by taking advantage of the relationship between the uncertainty and the model parameters of the first hidden layer of the local model. Delphi employs two types of optimisation , Bayesian Optimisation and Least Squares Trust Region, to search for the optimal poisoned model parameters, named as Delphi-BO and Delphi-LSTR. We quantify the uncertainty using the KL Divergence to minimise the distance of the predictive probability distribution towards an uncertain distribution of model output. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical proof for the attack effectiveness demonstrated in FL. Numerical results demonstrate that Delphi-BO induces a higher amount of uncertainty than Delphi-LSTR highlighting vulnerability of FL systems to model poisoning attacks.

> Billions of dollars are transacted through smart contracts, making vulnerabilities a major financial risk. One focus in the security arms race is on profitable vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Fuzzing is a key method for identifying these vulnerabilities. However, current solutions face two main limitations: a lack of profit-centric techniques for expediting detection, and insufficient automation in maximizing the profitability of discovered vulnerabilities, leaving the analysis to human experts. To address these gaps, we have developed VERITE, a profit-centric smart contract fuzzing framework that not only effectively detects those profitable vulnerabilities but also maximizes the exploited profits.   VERITE has three key features: 1) DeFi action-based mutators for boosting the exploration of transactions with different fund flows; 2) potentially profitable candidates identification criteria, which checks whether the input has caused abnormal fund flow properties during testing; 3) a gradient descent-based profit maximization strategy for these identified candidates.   VERITE is fully developed from scratch and evaluated on a dataset consisting of 61 exploited real-world DeFi projects with an average of over 1.1 million dollars loss. The results show that VERITE can automatically extract more than 18 million dollars in total and is significantly better than state-of-the-art fuzzer ITYFUZZ in both detection (29/9) and exploitation (58 times more profits gained on average). Remarkbly, in 12 targets, it gains more profits than real-world attacking exploits (1.01 to 11.45 times more). VERITE is also applied by auditors in contract auditing, where 6 (5 high severity) zero-day vulnerabilities are found with over $2,500 bounty rewards.

Our dataset encompasses 16 essential third-party components, including busybox and curl, and supports five CPU architectures: x86-64, i386, MIPS, ARMv7, and RISC-V64. Each precompiled binary is available at two compiler optimization levels (O0 and O3), facilitating comprehensive vulnerability analysis under different compilation scenarios. By providing detailed metadata and diverse binary samples, CveBinarySheet aims to accelerate the development of state-of-the-art BSCA tools, binary similarity analysis, and vulnerability matching applications.

- *Balasundaram Kadirvelu, Teresa Bellido Bel, Aglaia Freccero, Martina Di Simplicio, Dasha Nicholls, A Aldo Faisal*

- `2501.08851v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08851v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08851v1)

> Background: Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to mental disorders, with over 75% of cases manifesting before the age of 25. Research indicates that only 18 to 34% of young people experiencing high levels of depression or anxiety symptoms seek support. Digital tools leveraging smartphones offer scalable and early intervention opportunities. Objective: Using a novel machine learning framework, this study evaluated the feasibility of integrating active and passive smartphone data to predict mental disorders in non-clinical adolescents. Specifically, we investigated the utility of the Mindcraft app in predicting risks for internalising and externalising disorders, eating disorders, insomnia and suicidal ideation. Methods: Participants (N=103; mean age 16.1 years) were recruited from three London schools. Participants completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Eating Disorders-15 Questionnaire, Sleep Condition Indicator Questionnaire and indicated the presence/absence of suicidal ideation. They used the Mindcraft app for 14 days, contributing active data via self-reports and passive data from smartphone sensors. A contrastive pretraining phase was applied to enhance user-specific feature stability, followed by supervised fine-tuning. The model evaluation employed leave-one-subject-out cross-validation using balanced accuracy as the primary metric. Results: The integration of active and passive data achieved superior performance compared to individual data sources, with mean balanced accuracies of 0.71 for SDQ-High risk, 0.67 for insomnia, 0.77 for suicidal ideation and 0.70 for eating disorders. The contrastive learning framework stabilised daily behavioural representations, enhancing predictive robustness. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating active and passive smartphone data with advanced machine-learning techniques for predicting mental health risks.

> For classification and regression on tabular data, the dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) has recently been challenged by often much slower deep learning methods with extensive hyperparameter tuning. We address this discrepancy by introducing (a) RealMLP, an improved multilayer perceptron (MLP), and (b) strong meta-tuned default parameters for GBDTs and RealMLP. We tune RealMLP and the default parameters on a meta-train benchmark with 118 datasets and compare them to hyperparameter-optimized versions on a disjoint meta-test benchmark with 90 datasets, as well as the GBDT-friendly benchmark by Grinsztajn et al. (2022). Our benchmark results on medium-to-large tabular datasets (1K--500K samples) show that RealMLP offers a favorable time-accuracy tradeoff compared to other neural baselines and is competitive with GBDTs in terms of benchmark scores. Moreover, a combination of RealMLP and GBDTs with improved default parameters can achieve excellent results without hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we demonstrate that some of RealMLP's improvements can also considerably improve the performance of TabR with default parameters.

> Advances in the effectiveness of machine learning models have come at the cost of enormous complexity resulting in a poor understanding of how they function. Local surrogate methods have been used to approximate the workings of these complex models, but recent work has revealed their vulnerability to adversarial attacks where the explanation produced is appreciably different while the meaning and structure of the complex model's output remains similar. This prior work has focused on the existence of these weaknesses but not on their magnitude. Here we explore using an alternate search method with the goal of finding minimum viable perturbations, the fewest perturbations necessary to achieve a fixed similarity value between the original and altered text's explanation. Intuitively, a method that requires fewer perturbations to expose a given level of instability is inferior to one which requires more. This nuance allows for superior comparisons of the stability of explainability methods.

> Recent studies have explored the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various Software Engineering (SE) tasks, such as code generation and bug fixing. However, these approaches typically rely on the context data from the current snapshot of the project, overlooking the potential of rich historical data from real-world software repositories. Additionally, the impact of prompt styles on LLM performance within a historical context remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands for History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages individual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the results of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing capabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ Code Llama on a dataset of 51 single-line bugs, sourced from 11 open-source projects, by mining the historical context data of bugs and operationalizing this context in the form of seven heuristics. Our evaluation demonstrates that historical heuristics significantly enhance bug-fixing performance. For example, the FLN-all heuristic achieves a 10% improvement in performance compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by GitHub Copilot. Furthermore, HAFix-Agg fixes 45% more bugs than the baseline, outperforming FLN-all and demonstrating the best performance overall. Moreover, within the context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction style prompt as the most effective template for LLMs in bug fixing. Finally, we provide a pragmatic trade-off analysis of bug-fixing performance, cost, and time efficiency, offering valuable insights for the practical deployment of our approach in real-world scenarios.

> Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems applied across various domains, including NLP, information retrieval, and recommendation systems. Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.

> Software vulnerabilities continue to be the main cause of occurrence for cyber attacks. In an attempt to reduce them and improve software quality, software code analysis has emerged as a service offered by companies specialising in software testing. However, this service requires software companies to provide access to their software's code, which raises concerns about code privacy and intellectual property theft. This paper presents a novel approach to Software Quality and Privacy, in which testing companies can perform code analysis tasks on encrypted software code provided by software companies while code privacy is preserved. The approach combines Static Code Analysis and Searchable Symmetric Encryption in order to process the source code and build an encrypted inverted index that represents its data and control flows. The index is then used to discover vulnerabilities by carrying out static analysis tasks in a confidential way. With this approach, this paper also defines a new research field -- Confidential Code Analysis --, from which other types of code analysis tasks and approaches can be derived. We implemented the approach in a new tool called CoCoA and evaluated it experimentally with synthetic and real PHP web applications. The results show that the tool has similar precision as standard (non-confidential) static analysis tools and a modest average performance overhead of 42.7%.

> Prior research yielded many techniques to mitigate software compromise for low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Some of them detect software modifications via remote attestation and similar services, while others preventatively ensure software (static) integrity. However, achieving run-time (dynamic) security, e.g., control-flow integrity (CFI), remains a challenge.   Control-flow attestation (CFA) is one approach that minimizes the burden on devices. However, CFA is not a real-time countermeasure against run-time attacks since it requires communication with a verifying entity. This poses significant risks if safety- or time-critical tasks have memory vulnerabilities.   To address this issue, we construct EILID - a hybrid architecture that ensures software execution integrity by actively monitoring control-flow violations on low-end devices. EILID is built atop CASU, a prevention-based (i.e., active) hybrid Root-of-Trust (RoT) that guarantees software immutability. EILID achieves fine-grained backward-edge and function-level forward-edge CFI via semi-automatic code instrumentation and a secure shadow stack.

> The HyperText Markup Language 5 (HTML5) <canvas> is useful for creating visual-centric web applications. However, unlike traditional web applications, HTML5 <canvas> applications render objects onto the <canvas> bitmap without representing them in the Document Object Model (DOM). Mismatches between the expected and actual visual output of the <canvas> bitmap are termed visual bugs. Due to the visual-centric nature of <canvas> applications, visual bugs are important to detect because such bugs can render a <canvas> application useless. As we showed in prior work, Asset-Based graphics can provide the ground truth for a visual test oracle. However, many <canvas> applications procedurally generate their graphics. In this paper, we investigate how to detect visual bugs in <canvas> applications that use Procedural graphics as well. In particular, we explore the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically detect visual bugs. Instead of defining an exact visual test oracle, information about the application's expected functionality (the context) can be provided with the screenshot as input to the VLM. To evaluate this approach, we constructed a dataset containing 80 bug-injected screenshots across four visual bug types (Layout, Rendering, Appearance, and State) plus 20 bug-free screenshots from 20 <canvas> applications. We ran experiments with a state-of-the-art VLM using several combinations of text and image context to describe each application's expected functionality. Our results show that by providing the application README(s), a description of visual bug types, and a bug-free screenshot as context, VLMs can be leveraged to detect visual bugs with up to 100% per-application accuracy.

- *Haiyang Wang, Yuanyu Zhang, Xinghui Zhu, Ji He, Shuangtrui Zhao, Yulong Shen, Xiaohong Jiang*

- `2501.09246v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09246v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09246v1)

> This paper examines the Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) and, for the first time, discovers two critical vulnerabilities, namely artificially-manipulated time synchronization (ATS) and interruptible message authentication (IMA). ATS allows attackers falsify a receiver's signals and/or local reference time (LRT) while still fulfilling the time synchronization (TS) requirement. IMA allows temporary interruption of the navigation data authentication process due to the reception of a broken message (probably caused by spoofing attacks) and restores the authentication later. By exploiting the ATS vulnerability, we propose a TS-comply replay (TSR) attack with two variants (real-time and non-real-time), where attackers replay signals to a victim receiver while strictly complying with the TS rule. We further propose a TS-comply forgery (TSF) attack, where attackers first use a previously-disclosed key to forge a message based on the OSNMA protocol, then tamper with the vitcim receiver's LRT correspondingly to comply with the TS rule and finally transmit the forged message to the receiver. Finally, we propose a concatenating replay (CR) attack based on the IMA vulnerability, where attackers concatenate replayed signals to the victim receiver's signals in a way that still enables correct verification of the navigation data in the replayed signals. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks, we conduct real-world experiments with a commercial Galileo receiver manufactured by Septentrio, two software-defined radio (SDR) devices, open-source Galileo-SDR-SIM and OSNMAlib software. The results showed that all the attacks can successfully pass the OSNMA scheme and the TSF attack can spoof receivers to arbitrary locations.

> Accurate identification of software vulnerabilities is crucial for system integrity. Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug fixes or test improvements.   This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82. VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of 127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105 commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 11,632 functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and PrimeVul.   To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets. Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested exclusively on PrimeVul.

> Motivation: Automated bug detection in dynamically typed languages such as Python is essential for maintaining code quality. The lack of mandatory type annotations in such languages can lead to errors that are challenging to identify early with traditional static analysis tools. Recent progress in deep neural networks has led to increased use of neural bug detectors. In statically typed languages, a type checker is integrated into the compiler and thus taken into consideration when the neural bug detector is designed for these languages.   Problem: However, prior studies overlook this aspect during the training and testing of neural bug detectors for dynamically typed languages. When an optional type checker is used, assessing existing neural bug detectors on bugs easily detectable by type checkers may impact their performance estimation. Moreover, including these bugs in the training set of neural bug detectors can shift their detection focus toward the wrong type of bugs.   Contribution: We explore the impact of type checking on various neural bug detectors for variable misuse bugs, a common type targeted by neural bug detectors. Existing synthetic and real-world datasets are type-checked to evaluate the prevalence of type-related bugs. Then, we investigate how type-related bugs influence the training and testing of the neural bug detectors.   Findings: Our findings indicate that existing bug detection datasets contain a significant proportion of type-related bugs. Building on this insight, we discover integrating the neural bug detector with a type checker can be beneficial, especially when the code is annotated with types. Further investigation reveals neural bug detectors perform better on type-related bugs than other bugs. Moreover, removing type-related bugs from the training data helps improve neural bug detectors' ability to identify bugs beyond the scope of type checkers.

> Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries alter model behavior on target classification labels by embedding triggers into data samples. While these attacks have received considerable attention in horizontal FL, they are less understood for vertical FL (VFL), where devices hold different features of the samples, and only the server holds the labels. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on VFL which (i) does not rely on gradient information from the server and (ii) considers potential collusion among multiple adversaries for sample selection and trigger embedding. Our label inference model augments variational autoencoders with metric learning, which adversaries can train locally. A consensus process over the adversary graph topology determines which datapoints to poison. We further propose methods for trigger splitting across the adversaries, with an intensity-based implantation scheme skewing the server towards the trigger. Our convergence analysis reveals the impact of backdoor perturbations on VFL indicated by a stationarity gap for the trained model, which we verify empirically as well. We conduct experiments comparing our attack with recent backdoor VFL approaches, finding that ours obtains significantly higher success rates for the same main task performance despite not using server information. Additionally, our results verify the impact of collusion on attack performance.

> Developing high-performance deep learning models is resource-intensive, leading model owners to utilize Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms instead of publicly releasing their models. However, malicious users may exploit query interfaces to execute model extraction attacks, reconstructing the target model's functionality locally. While prior research has investigated triggerable watermarking techniques for asserting ownership, existing methods face significant challenges: (1) most approaches require additional training, resulting in high overhead and limited flexibility, and (2) they often fail to account for advanced attackers, leaving them vulnerable to adaptive attacks.   In this paper, we propose Neural Honeytrace, a robust plug-and-play watermarking framework against model extraction attacks. We first formulate a watermark transmission model from an information-theoretic perspective, providing an interpretable account of the principles and limitations of existing triggerable watermarking. Guided by the model, we further introduce: (1) a similarity-based training-free watermarking method for plug-and-play and flexible watermarking, and (2) a distribution-based multi-step watermark information transmission strategy for robust watermarking. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that Neural Honeytrace outperforms previous methods in efficiency and resisting adaptive attacks. Neural Honeytrace reduces the average number of samples required for a worst-case t-Test-based copyright claim from $12,000$ to $200$ with zero training cost.

> Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely exploited to simplify and facilitate programming. With these tools, developers can easily generate the desired complete functional code based on incomplete code snippets and natural language prompts. Unfortunately, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former poisons the training data or model parameters, hijacking the LLMs to generate malicious code snippets when encountering the trigger. The latter crafts malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of the generated codes. However, both attacks have some inherent limitations: backdoor attacks rely on the adversary's capability of controlling the model training process; adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes. This paper presents a novel attack paradigm against Code LLMs, namely target-specific prompt injection attack (TPIA). TPIA generates non-functional perturbations containing the information of malicious instructions and inserts them into the victim's code context by spreading them into potentially used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base). It induces the Code LLMs to generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at the target location. In general, we compress the attacker-specified malicious objective into the perturbation by adversarial optimization based on greedy token search. We collect 13 representative malicious objectives to design 31 threat cases for three popular programming languages. We show that our TPIA can successfully attack three representative open-source Code LLMs (with an ASR of up to 97.9%) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with an ASR of over 90%) in all threat cases, using only a 12-token perturbation. Our work alerts a new practical threat of using Code LLMs.

> In this study, we explore the inherent trade-off between accuracy and robustness in neural networks, drawing an analogy to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. We propose that neural networks are subject to an uncertainty relation, which manifests as a fundamental limitation in their ability to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. Through mathematical proofs and empirical evidence, we demonstrate that this trade-off is a natural consequence of the sharp boundaries formed between different class concepts during training. Our findings reveal that the complementarity principle, a cornerstone of quantum physics, applies to neural networks, imposing fundamental limits on their capabilities in simultaneous learning of conjugate features. Meanwhile, our work suggests that achieving human-level intelligence through a single network architecture or massive datasets alone may be inherently limited. Our work provides new insights into the theoretical foundations of neural network vulnerability and opens up avenues for designing more robust neural network architectures.

- `2410.24031v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24031v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24031v3)

> Face recognition technologies are increasingly used in various applications, yet they are vulnerable to face spoofing attacks. These spoofing attacks often involve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens. Although stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, their high-cost limits their widespread adoption. Conversely, two-sensor systems without extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable to calculate depth using stereo techniques. In this work, we propose a method to overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparity information and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, using non-calibrated systems. We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coined Disparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modality alongside the two original sensor modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using a comprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455. Our method outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 1%. These errors are lower by 2.45% and 7.94% than the errors of the best comparison method, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a model ensemble that addresses 3D spoof attacks as well, achieving an EER of 2.04% and an FNR of 3.83% at an FPR of 1%. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of anti-spoofing in non-calibrated systems that lack depth information.

> As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in healthcare delivery, this chapter explores the critical aspects of developing reliable and ethical Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). Beginning with the fundamental transition from traditional statistical models to sophisticated machine learning approaches, this work examines rigorous validation strategies and performance assessment methods, including the crucial role of model calibration and decision curve analysis. The chapter emphasizes that creating trustworthy AI systems in healthcare requires more than just technical accuracy; it demands careful consideration of fairness, explainability, and privacy. The challenge of ensuring equitable healthcare delivery through AI is stressed, discussing methods to identify and mitigate bias in clinical predictive models. The chapter then delves into explainability as a cornerstone of human-centered CDSS. This focus reflects the understanding that healthcare professionals must not only trust AI recommendations but also comprehend their underlying reasoning. The discussion advances in an analysis of privacy vulnerabilities in medical AI systems, from data leakage in deep learning models to sophisticated attacks against model explanations. The text explores privacy-preservation strategies such as differential privacy and federated learning, while acknowledging the inherent trade-offs between privacy protection and model performance. This progression, from technical validation to ethical considerations, reflects the multifaceted challenges of developing AI systems that can be seamlessly and reliably integrated into daily clinical practice while maintaining the highest standards of patient care and data protection.

> Machine learning developers frequently use interactive computational notebooks, such as Jupyter notebooks, to host code for data processing and model training. Jupyter notebooks provide a convenient tool for writing machine learning pipelines and interactively observing outputs, however, maintaining Jupyter notebooks, e.g., to add new features or fix bugs, can be challenging due to the length and complexity of the notebooks. Moreover, there is no existing benchmark related to developer edits on Jupyter notebooks. To address this, we present the first dataset of 48,398 Jupyter notebook edits derived from 20,095 revisions of 792 machine learning repositories on GitHub, and perform the first study of the using LLMs to predict code edits in Jupyter notebooks. Our dataset captures granular details of cell-level and line-level modifications, offering a foundation for understanding real-world maintenance patterns in machine learning workflows. We observed that the edits on Jupyter notebooks are highly localized, with changes averaging only 166 lines of code in repositories. While larger models outperform smaller counterparts in code editing, all models have low accuracy on our dataset even after finetuning, demonstrating the complexity of real-world machine learning maintenance tasks. Our findings emphasize the critical role of contextual information in improving model performance and point toward promising avenues for advancing large language models' capabilities in engineering machine learning code.

> The rapid advancements in quantum computing present significant threats to existing encryption standards and internet security. Simultaneously, the advent of Web 3.0 marks a transformative era in internet history, emphasizing enhanced data security, decentralization, and user ownership. This white paper introduces the W3ID, an abbreviation of Web3 standard meeting universal digital ID, which is a Universal Digital Identity (UDI) model designed to meet Web3 standards while addressing vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing. W3ID innovatively generates secure Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) tailored for the decentralized Web 3.0 ecosystem. Additionally, W3ID employs a dual-key system for secure authentication, enhancing both public and private verification mechanisms. To further enhance encryption strength and authentication integrity in the quantum computing era, W3ID incorporates an advanced security mechanism. By requiring quadruple application of SHA-256, with consecutive matches for validation, the system expands the number of possibilities to 256^4, which is approximately 4.3 billion times the current SHA-256 capacity. This dramatic increase in computational complexity ensures that even advanced quantum computing systems would face significant challenges in executing brute-force attacks. W3ID redefines digital identity standards for Web 3.0 and the quantum computing era, setting a new benchmark for security, scalability, and decentralization in the global digital twin ecosystem.

- *Daryl DeFord, Ellen Veomett*

- `2406.12167v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12167v3)

> We consider two symmetry metrics commonly used to analyze partisan gerrymandering: the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB). Our main results compare, for combinations of seats and votes achievable in districted elections, the number of districts won by each party to the extent of potential deviation from the ideal metric values, taking into account the political geography of the state. These comparisons are motivated by examples where the MM and PB have been used in efforts to detect when a districting plan awards extreme number of districts won by some party. These examples include expert testimony, public-facing apps, recommendations by experts to redistricting commissions, and public policy proposals.   To achieve this goal we perform both theoretical and empirical analyses of the MM and PB. In our theoretical analysis, we consider vote-share, seat-share pairs (V, S) for which one can construct election data having vote share V and seat share S, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of (V,S) pairs that achieve MM = 0, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of (V,S) pairs. We show how the set of such (V,S) pairs allowing for MM = 0 (and PB = 0) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to vary. By observing the results of this theoretical analysis, we can show that the values taken on by these metrics do not necessarily attain more extreme values in plans with more extreme numbers of districts won. We also analyze specific example elections, showing how these metrics can return unintuitive results. We follow this with an empirical study, where we show that on 18 different U.S. maps these metrics can fail to detect extreme seats outcomes.

> Scientific advancements rely on high-performance computing (HPC) applications that model real-world phenomena through simulations. These applications process vast amounts of data on specialized accelerators (eg., GPUs) using special libraries. Heterogeneous bugs occur in these applications when managing data movement across different platforms, such as CPUs and GPUs, leading to divergent behavior when using heterogeneous platforms compared to using only CPUs. Existing software testing techniques often fail to detect such bugs because either they do not account for platform-specific characteristics or target specific platforms. To address this problem, we present HeteroBugDetect, an automated approach to detect platform-dependent heterogeneous bugs in HPC scientific applications. HeteroBugDetect combines natural-language processing, off-target testing, custom fuzzing, and differential testing to provide an end-to-end solution for detecting platform-specific bugs in scientific applications. We evaluate HeteroBugDetect on LAMMPS, a molecular dynamics simulator, where it detected multiple heterogeneous bugs, enhancing its reliability across diverse HPC environments.

> Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior while improving its internal structure. Refactoring engines are integral components of modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and can automate or semi-automate this process to enhance code readability, reduce complexity, and improve the maintainability of software products. Similar to traditional software systems such as compilers, refactoring engines may also contain bugs that can lead to unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called RETESTER, a LLM-based framework for automated refactoring engine testing. Specifically, by using input program structure templates extracted from historical bug reports and input program characteristics that are error-prone, we design chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to perform refactoring-preserving transformations. The generated variants are then tested on the latest version of refactoring engines using differential testing. We evaluate RETESTER on two most popular modern refactoring engines (i.e., ECLIPSE, and INTELLIJ IDEA). It successfully revealed 18 new bugs in the latest version of those refactoring engines. By the time we submit our paper, seven of them were confirmed by their developers, and three were fixed.

> Over the years, IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS) networks have become increasingly critical as they form the backbone of modern telecommunications, enabling the integration of multimedia services such as voice, video, and messaging over IP-based infrastructures and next-generation networks. However, this integration has led to an increase in the attack surface of the IMS network, making it more prone to various forms of cyber threats and attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, SIP-based attacks, unauthorized access, etc. As a result, it is important to find a way to manage and assess the security of IMS networks, but there is a lack of a systematic approach to managing the identification of vulnerabilities and threats. In this paper, we propose a model and a threat-specific risk security modeling and assessment approach to model and assess the threats of the IMS network. This model will provide a structured methodology for representing and analyzing threats and attack scenarios in layers within a hierarchical model. The proposed model aims to enhance the security posture of IMS networks by improving vulnerability management, risk evaluation, and defense evaluation against cyber threats. We perform a preliminary evaluation based on vulnerability collected from the National Vulnerability Database for devices in the IMS network. The results showed that we can model and assess the threats of IMS networks. IMS network defenders can use this model to understand their security postures taking into account the threat and risk posed by each vulnerability.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) perform impressively well in various applications. However, the potential for misuse of these models in activities such as plagiarism, generating fake news, and spamming has raised concern about their responsible use. Consequently, the reliable detection of AI-generated text has become a critical area of research. AI text detectors have shown to be effective under their specific settings. In this paper, we stress-test the robustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We introduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of detection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural network-based detectors, zero shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors. Our experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long, reveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks. Our findings indicate that while our recursive paraphrasing method can significantly reduce detection rates, it only slightly degrades text quality in many cases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in current detection systems in the presence of an attacker. Additionally, we investigate the susceptibility of watermarked LLMs to spoofing attacks aimed at misclassifying human-written text as AI-generated. We demonstrate that an attacker can infer hidden AI text signatures without white-box access to the detection method, potentially leading to reputational risks for LLM developers. Finally, we provide a theoretical framework connecting the AUROC of the best possible detector to the Total Variation distance between human and AI text distributions. This analysis offers insights into the fundamental challenges of reliable detection as language models continue to advance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/vinusankars/Reliability-of-AI-text-detectors.

> Developing high-performance deep learning models is resource-intensive, leading model owners to utilize Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms instead of publicly releasing their models. However, malicious users may exploit query interfaces to execute model extraction attacks, reconstructing the target model's functionality locally. While prior research has investigated triggerable watermarking techniques for asserting ownership, existing methods face significant challenges: (1) most approaches require additional training, resulting in high overhead and limited flexibility, and (2) they often fail to account for advanced attackers, leaving them vulnerable to adaptive attacks.   In this paper, we propose Neural Honeytrace, a robust plug-and-play watermarking framework against model extraction attacks. We first formulate a watermark transmission model from an information-theoretic perspective, providing an interpretable account of the principles and limitations of existing triggerable watermarking. Guided by the model, we further introduce: (1) a similarity-based training-free watermarking method for plug-and-play and flexible watermarking, and (2) a distribution-based multi-step watermark information transmission strategy for robust watermarking. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that Neural Honeytrace outperforms previous methods in efficiency and resisting adaptive attacks. Neural Honeytrace reduces the average number of samples required for a worst-case t-Test-based copyright claim from $12,000$ to $200$ with zero training cost.

> This paper introduces a novel fuzzing framework, SyzParam which incorporates runtime parameters into the fuzzing process. Achieving this objective requires addressing several key challenges, including valid value extraction, inter-device relation construction, and fuzz engine integration. By inspecting the data structures and functions associated with the LKDM, our tool can extract runtime parameters across various drivers through static analysis. Additionally, SyzParam collects inter-device relations and identifies associations between runtime parameters and drivers. Furthermore, SyzParam proposes a novel mutation strategy, which leverages these relations and prioritizes parameter modification during related driver execution. Our evaluation demonstrates that SyzParam outperforms existing fuzzing works in driver code coverage and bug-detection capabilities. To date, we have identified 30 unique bugs in the latest kernel upstreams, with 20 confirmed and 14 patched into the mainline kernel, including 9 CVEs.

> This paper provides a comprehensive review of the future of cybersecurity through Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). We explore LLM applications across various domains, including hardware design security, intrusion detection, software engineering, design verification, cyber threat intelligence, malware detection, and phishing detection. We present an overview of LLM evolution and its current state, focusing on advancements in models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, BERT, Falcon2, and LLaMA. Our analysis extends to LLM vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, data poisoning, DDoS attacks, and adversarial instructions. We delve into mitigation strategies to protect these models, providing a comprehensive look at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.

> The ever-increasing number of threats and the existing diversity of information sources pose challenges for Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). To respond to emerging threats, CERTs must gather information in a timely and comprehensive manner. But the volume of sources and information leads to information overload. This paper contributes to the question of how to reduce information overload for CERTs. We propose clustering incoming information as scanning this information is one of the most tiresome, but necessary, manual steps. Based on current studies, we establish conditions for such a framework. Different types of evaluation metrics are used and selected in relation to the framework conditions. Furthermore, different document embeddings and distance measures are evaluated and interpreted in combination with clustering methods. We use three different corpora for the evaluation, a novel ground truth corpus based on threat reports, one security bug report (SBR) corpus, and one with news articles. Our work shows, it is possible to reduce the information overload by up to 84.8% with homogeneous clusters. A runtime analysis of the clustering methods strengthens the decision of selected clustering methods.

> The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their safety and reliability, particularly regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that attributes this vulnerability to reward misspecification during the alignment process. This misspecification occurs when the reward function fails to accurately capture the intended behavior, leading to misaligned model outputs. We introduce a metric ReGap to quantify the extent of reward misspecification and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness in detecting harmful backdoor prompts. Building upon these insights, we present ReMiss, a system for automated red teaming that generates adversarial prompts in a reward-misspecified space. ReMiss achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on the AdvBench benchmark against various target aligned LLMs while preserving the human readability of the generated prompts. Furthermore, these attacks on open-source models demonstrate high transferability to closed-source models like GPT-4o and out-of-distribution tasks from HarmBench. Detailed analysis highlights the unique advantages of the proposed reward misspecification objective compared to previous methods, offering new insights for improving LLM safety and robustness.

> The conventional discourse on existential risks (x-risks) from AI typically focuses on abrupt, dire events caused by advanced AI systems, particularly those that might achieve or surpass human-level intelligence. These events have severe consequences that either lead to human extinction or irreversibly cripple human civilization to a point beyond recovery. This discourse, however, often neglects the serious possibility of AI x-risks manifesting incrementally through a series of smaller yet interconnected disruptions, gradually crossing critical thresholds over time. This paper contrasts the conventional "decisive AI x-risk hypothesis" with an "accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis." While the former envisions an overt AI takeover pathway, characterized by scenarios like uncontrollable superintelligence, the latter suggests a different causal pathway to existential catastrophes. This involves a gradual accumulation of critical AI-induced threats such as severe vulnerabilities and systemic erosion of economic and political structures. The accumulative hypothesis suggests a boiling frog scenario where incremental AI risks slowly converge, undermining societal resilience until a triggering event results in irreversible collapse. Through systems analysis, this paper examines the distinct assumptions differentiating these two hypotheses. It is then argued that the accumulative view can reconcile seemingly incompatible perspectives on AI risks. The implications of differentiating between these causal pathways -- the decisive and the accumulative -- for the governance of AI as well as long-term AI safety are discussed.

> Recent work has investigated the vulnerability of local surrogate methods to adversarial perturbations on a machine learning (ML) model's inputs, where the explanation is manipulated while the meaning and structure of the original input remains similar under the complex model. Although weaknesses across many methods have been shown to exist, the reasons behind why remain little explored. Central to the concept of adversarial attacks on explainable AI (XAI) is the similarity measure used to calculate how one explanation differs from another. A poor choice of similarity measure can lead to erroneous conclusions on the efficacy of an XAI method. Too sensitive a measure results in exaggerated vulnerability, while too coarse understates its weakness. We investigate a variety of similarity measures designed for text-based ranked lists, including Kendall's Tau, Spearman's Footrule, and Rank-biased Overlap to determine how substantial changes in the type of measure or threshold of success affect the conclusions generated from common adversarial attack processes. Certain measures are found to be overly sensitive, resulting in erroneous estimates of stability.

> Software bugs pose a significant challenge during development and maintenance, and practitioners spend nearly 50% of their time dealing with bugs. Many existing techniques adopt Information Retrieval (IR) to localize a reported bug using textual and semantic relevance between bug reports and source code. However, they often struggle to bridge a critical gap between bug reports and code that requires in-depth contextual understanding, which goes beyond textual or semantic relevance. In this paper, we present a novel technique for bug localization - BRaIn - that addresses the contextual gaps by assessing the relevance between bug reports and code with Large Language Models (LLM). It then leverages the LLM's feedback (a.k.a., Intelligent Relevance Feedback) to reformulate queries and re-rank source documents, improving bug localization. We evaluate BRaIn using a benchmark dataset, Bench4BL, and three performance metrics and compare it against six baseline techniques from the literature. Our experimental results show that BRaIn outperforms baselines by 87.6%, 89.5%, and 48.8% margins in MAP, MRR, and HIT@K, respectively. Additionally, it can localize approximately 52% of bugs that cannot be localized by the baseline techniques due to the poor quality of corresponding bug reports. By addressing the contextual gaps and introducing Intelligent Relevance Feedback, BRaIn advances not only theory but also improves IR-based bug localization.

> Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on applied tasks such as vulnerability detection. We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.

> Full stack software applications are often simplified to basic CRUD operations, which can overlook the intricate principles of computer science necessary for addressing complex development challenges. Current methodologies frequently fall short in efficiency when managing these complexities. This paper presents an innovative approach that leverages foundational computer science principles, specifically using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), to model sophisticated business problems. We introduce Breadth-First Development (BFD), Depth-First Development (DFD), Cyclic Directed Development (CDD), Directed Acyclic Development (DAD), Primary BFD (PBFD), and Primary DFD (PDFD), to enhance application development. By employing bitmaps, this approach eliminates junction tables, resulting in more compact and efficient data processing within relational databases. Rigorous testing and over eight years of production deployment for tens of thousands of users have yielded remarkable results: zero bugs, development speed improvements of up to twenty times, performance gains of seven to eight times, and storage requirements reduced to one-eleventh compared to traditional methods.

> Ensuring safety alignment has become a critical requirement for large language models (LLMs), particularly given their widespread deployment in real-world applications. However, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which exploit system vulnerabilities to bypass safety measures and generate harmful outputs. Although numerous defense mechanisms based on adversarial training have been proposed, a persistent challenge lies in the exacerbation of over-refusal behaviors, which compromise the overall utility of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Latent-space Adversarial Training with Post-aware Calibration (LATPC) framework. During the adversarial training phase, LATPC compares harmful and harmless instructions in the latent space and extracts safety-critical dimensions to construct refusal features attack, precisely simulating agnostic jailbreak attack types requiring adversarial mitigation. At the inference stage, an embedding-level calibration mechanism is employed to alleviate over-refusal behaviors with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to various defense methods across five types of jailbreak attacks, LATPC framework achieves a superior balance between safety and utility. Moreover, our analysis underscores the effectiveness of extracting safety-critical dimensions from the latent space for constructing robust refusal feature attacks.

> This paper investigates the resilience of a ResNet-50 image classification model under two prominent security threats: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attacks and malicious payload injection. Initially, the model attains a 53.33% accuracy on clean images. When subjected to FGSM perturbations, its overall accuracy remains unchanged; however, the model's confidence in incorrect predictions notably increases. Concurrently, a payload injection scheme is successfully executed in 93.33% of the tested samples, revealing how stealthy attacks can manipulate model predictions without degrading visual quality. These findings underscore the vulnerability of even high-performing neural networks and highlight the urgency of developing more robust defense mechanisms for security-critical applications.

> The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of digital devices like sensors, processors, embedded and communication devices that can connect to and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet. IoT devices have limitations on power, memory, and computational resources. Researchers have developed the IPv6 Over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) protocols to provide wireless connectivity among these devices while overcoming the constraints on resources. 6LoWPAN has been approved subsequently by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF Routing Over Low-power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) standardized the Routing Protocol for LLNs known as RPL (IETF RFC 6550), which is part of the 6LoWPAN stack. However, IoT devices are vulnerable to various attacks on RPL-based routing. This survey provides an in depth study of existing RPL-based attacks and defense published from year 2011 to 2024 from highly reputed journals and conferences. By thematic analysis of existing routing attacks on RPL, we developed a novel attack taxonomy which focuses on the nature of routing attacks and classifies them into 12 major categories. Subsequently, the impact of each attack on the network is analyzed and discussed real life scenarios of these attacks. Another contribution of this survey proposed a novel taxonomy for classification of defense mechanisms into 8 major categories against routing attacks based on type of defense strategy. The detailed analysis of each defense mechanism with real life applicability is explained. Furthermore, evaluation tools such as testbeds and simulators for RPL-based attack and defense are discussed and critically analyzed in terms of real world applicability. Finally, open research challenges are presented on the basis of research gaps of existing literature along with research directions for practitioners and researchers.

- `2501.10835v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10835v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10835v1)

> This study investigates the spatial patterns and temporal variations in outage duration, intensity, and restoration/recovery following the 2024 Hurricane Beryl in Houston, Texas. This historic blackout caused widespread power disruptions across the Houston metropolitan area, leaving more than 2 million customers without power over several days, resulting in more than 143 million total customer-out hours.The findings reveal that areas with higher population density and proximity to the hurricane's path experienced more severe initial impacts. Regions with higher median income showed faster recovery, while lower-income areas exhibited prolonged restoration periods, even with favorable infrastructural conditions, suggesting disparities in restoration speed. The study also highlights how urban development features, such as road density and land elevation, explain spatial disparities in power outage impacts and recovery. This research advances the understanding of power outage dynamics in large metropolitan regions through four key contributions: (1) empirical characterization of outages from a historic hurricane, highlighting infrastructure vulnerabilities in a high-density urban context; (2) comprehensive analysis using multiple metrics to capture spatiotemporal dynamics of outages and restoration; (3) leveraging of high-resolution outage data at fine geographic scales and frequent intervals to quantify and reveal previously masked spatial disparities; and (4) systematic examination of socioeconomic, urban development, and environmental factors in shaping disparities in outage impacts and recovery timelines. These findings provide infrastructure managers, operators, utilities, and decision-makers with crucial empirical insights to quantify power outage impacts, justify resilience investments, and address vulnerability and equity issues in the power infrastructure during hazard events.

- *Jiadong Lou, Xu Yuan, Rui Zhang, Xingliang Yuan, Neil Gong, Nian-Feng Tzeng*

- `2501.10985v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10985v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10985v1)

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited superior performance in various classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, they encounter the potential vulnerability from the link stealing attacks, which can infer the presence of a link between two nodes via measuring the similarity of its incident nodes' prediction vectors produced by a GNN model. Such attacks pose severe security and privacy threats to the training graph used in GNN models. In this work, we propose a novel solution, called Graph Link Disguise (GRID), to defend against link stealing attacks with the formal guarantee of GNN model utility for retaining prediction accuracy. The key idea of GRID is to add carefully crafted noises to the nodes' prediction vectors for disguising adjacent nodes as n-hop indirect neighboring nodes. We take into account the graph topology and select only a subset of nodes (called core nodes) covering all links for adding noises, which can avert the noises offset and have the further advantages of reducing both the distortion loss and the computation cost. Our crafted noises can ensure 1) the noisy prediction vectors of any two adjacent nodes have their similarity level like that of two non-adjacent nodes and 2) the model prediction is unchanged to ensure zero utility loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed GRID solution against different representative link-stealing attacks under transductive settings and inductive settings respectively, as well as two influence-based attacks. Meanwhile, it achieves a much better privacy-utility trade-off than existing methods when extended to GNNs.

> The Cyber threats exposure has created worldwide pressure on organizations to comply with cyber security standards and policies for protecting their digital assets. Vulnerability assessment (VA) and Penetration Testing (PT) are widely adopted Security Compliance (SC) methods to identify security gaps and anticipate security breaches. In the computer networks context and despite the use of autonomous tools and systems, security compliance remains highly repetitive and resources consuming. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to tackle the ever-growing problem of efficiency and effectiveness in network infrastructures security auditing by formally introducing, designing, and developing an Expert-System Automated Security Compliance Framework (ESASCF) that enables industrial and open-source VA and PT tools and systems to extract, process, store and re-use the expertise in a human-expert way to allow direct application in similar scenarios or during the periodic re-testing. The implemented model was then integrated within the ESASCF and tested on different size networks and proved efficient in terms of time-efficiency and testing effectiveness allowing ESASCF to take over autonomously the SC in Re-testing and offloading Expert by automating repeated segments SC and thus enabling Experts to prioritize important tasks in Ad-Hoc compliance tests. The obtained results validate the performance enhancement notably by cutting the time required for an expert to 50% in the context of typical corporate networks first SC and 20% in re-testing, representing a significant cost-cutting. In addition, the framework allows a long-term impact illustrated in the knowledge extraction, generalization, and re-utilization, which enables better SC confidence independent of the human expert skills, coverage, and wrong decisions resulting in impactful false negatives.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to daily life, showcasing their vast potential across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Beyond NLP, LLMs are increasingly used in software development tasks, such as code completion, modification, bug fixing, and code translation. Software engineers widely use tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q, streamlining workflows and automating tasks with high accuracy. While the resource and energy intensity of LLM training is often highlighted, inference can be even more resource-intensive over time, as it's a continuous process with a high number of invocations. Therefore, developing resource-efficient alternatives for LLM inference is crucial for sustainability. This work proposes GREEN-CODE, a framework for energy-aware code generation in LLMs. GREEN-CODE performs dynamic early exit during LLM inference. We train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that learns to balance the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. Our approach is evaluated on two open-source LLMs, Llama 3.2 3B and OPT 2.7B, using the JavaCorpus and PY150 datasets. Results show that our method reduces the energy consumption between 23-50 % on average for code generation tasks without significantly affecting accuracy.

> The security requirements for future 6G mobile networks are anticipated to be significantly more complex and demanding than those of 5G. This increase stems from several factors: the proliferation of massive machine-type communications will dramatically increase the density of devices competing for network access; secure ultra-reliable low-latency communication will impose stringent requirements on security, latency, and reliability; and the widespread deployment of small cells and non-terrestrial networks, including satellite mega-constellations, will result in more frequent handovers. This paper provides a set of security recommendations for 6G networks, with a particular focus on access and handover procedures, which often lack encryption and integrity protection, making them more vulnerable to exploitation. Since 6G is expected to be a backward-compatible extension of 5G, and given that secure systems cannot be effectively designed without a clear understanding of their goals, it is imperative to first evaluate the limitations of the current generation. To this end, the paper begins by reviewing existing 5G access and authentication mechanisms, highlighting several critical vulnerabilities in these procedures. It then examines potential 6G challenges and concludes with actionable recommendations to enhance the security, resilience, and robustness of 6G access and handover mechanisms.

> Sanitizers provide robust test oracles for various software vulnerabilities. Fuzzing on sanitizer-enabled programs has been the best practice to find software bugs. Since sanitizers need to heavily instrument a target program to insert run-time checks, sanitizer-enabled programs have much higher overhead compared to normally built programs. In this paper, we present SAND, a new fuzzing framework that decouples sanitization from the fuzzing loop. SAND performs fuzzing on a normally built program and only invokes sanitizer-enabled programs when input is shown to be interesting. Since most of the generated inputs are not interesting, i.e., not bug-triggering, SAND allows most of the fuzzing time to be spent on the normally built program. To identify interesting inputs, we introduce execution pattern for a practical execution analysis on the normally built program. We realize SAND on top of AFL++ and evaluate it on 12 real-world programs. Our extensive evaluation highlights its effectiveness: in 24 hours, compared to all the baseline fuzzers, SAND significantly discovers more bugs while not missing any.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous promise in automated software engineering. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities of LLMs for automatic regression test generation for programs that take highly structured, human-readable inputs, such as XML parsers or JavaScript interpreters. Concretely, we explore the following regression test generation scenarios for such programs that have so far been difficult to test automatically in the absence of corresponding input grammars:   $\bullet$ Bug finding. Given a code change (e.g., a commit or pull request), our LLM-based approach generates a test case with the objective of revealing any bugs that might be introduced if that change is applied.   $\bullet$ Patch testing. Given a patch, our LLM-based approach generates a test case that fails before but passes after the patch. This test can be added to the regression test suite to catch similar bugs in the future.   We implement Cleverest, a feedback-directed, zero-shot LLM-based regression test generation technique, and evaluate its effectiveness on 22 commits to three subject programs: Mujs, Libxml2, and Poppler. For programs using more human-readable file formats, like XML or JavaScript, we found Cleverest performed very well. It generated easy-to-understand bug-revealing or bug-reproduction test cases for the majority of commits in just under three minutes -- even when only the code diff or commit message (unless it was too vague) was given. For programs with more compact file formats, like PDF, as expected, it struggled to generate effective test cases. However, the LLM-supplied test cases are not very far from becoming effective (e.g., when used as a seed by a greybox fuzzer or as a starting point by the developer).

> Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) signify a groundbreaking paradigm shift within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community, extending beyond the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assimilating additional modalities (e.g., images). Despite this advancement, the safety of LVLMs remains adequately underexplored, with a potential overreliance on the safety assurances purported by their underlying LLMs. In this paper, we propose FigStep, a straightforward yet effective black-box jailbreak algorithm against LVLMs. Instead of feeding textual harmful instructions directly, FigStep converts the prohibited content into images through typography to bypass the safety alignment. The experimental results indicate that FigStep can achieve an average attack success rate of 82.50% on six promising open-source LVLMs. Not merely to demonstrate the efficacy of FigStep, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies and analyze the distribution of the semantic embeddings to uncover that the reason behind the success of FigStep is the deficiency of safety alignment for visual embeddings. Moreover, we compare FigStep with five text-only jailbreaks and four image-based jailbreaks to demonstrate the superiority of FigStep, i.e., negligible attack costs and better attack performance. Above all, our work reveals that current LVLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which highlights the necessity of novel cross-modality safety alignment techniques.

> Video Copy Detection (VCD) plays a crucial role in copyright protection and content verification by identifying duplicates and near-duplicates in large-scale video databases. The META AI Challenge on video copy detection provided a benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art methods, with the Dual-level detection approach emerging as a winning solution. This method integrates Video Editing Detection and Frame Scene Detection to handle adversarial transformations and large datasets efficiently. However, our analysis reveals significant limitations in the VED component, particularly in its ability to handle exact copies. Moreover, Dual-level detection shows vulnerability to temporal attacks. To address it, we propose an improved frame selection strategy based on local maxima of interframe differences, which enhances robustness against adversarial temporal modifications while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our method achieves an increase of 1.4 to 5.8 times in efficiency over the standard 1 FPS approach. Compared to Dual-level detection method, our approach maintains comparable micro-average precision ($\mu$AP) while also demonstrating improved robustness against temporal attacks. Given 56\% reduced representation size and the inference time of more than 2 times faster, our approach is more suitable to real-world resource restriction.

> Microcontroller-based embedded systems are vital in daily life, but are especially vulnerable to control-flow hijacking attacks due to hardware and software constraints. Control-Flow Attestation (CFA) aims to precisely attest the execution path of a program to a remote verifier. However, existing CFA solutions face challenges with large measurement and/or trace data, limiting these solutions to small programs. In addition, slow software-based measurement calculations limit their feasibility for microcontroller systems. In this paper, we present ENOLA, an efficient control-flow attestation solution for low-end embedded systems. ENOLA introduces a novel authenticator that achieves linear space complexity. Moreover, ENOLA capitalizes on the latest hardware-assisted message authentication code computation capabilities found in commercially-available devices for measurement computation. ENOLA employs a trusted execution environment, and allocates general-purpose registers to thwart memory corruption attacks. We have developed the ENOLA compiler through LLVM passes and attestation engine on the ARMv8.1-M architecture. Our evaluations demonstrate ENOLA's effectiveness in minimizing data transmission, while achieving lower or comparable performance to the existing works.

> Recent studies reveal that local differential privacy (LDP) protocols are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks where an attacker can manipulate the final estimate on the server by leveraging the characteristics of LDP and sending carefully crafted data from a small fraction of controlled local clients. This vulnerability raises concerns regarding the robustness and reliability of LDP in hostile environments.   In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of the robustness of state-of-the-art LDP protocols for numerical attributes, i.e., categorical frequency oracles (CFOs) with binning and consistency, and distribution reconstruction. We evaluate protocol robustness through an attack-driven approach and propose new metrics for cross-protocol attack gain measurement. The results indicate that Square Wave and CFO-based protocols in the Server setting are more robust against the attack compared to the CFO-based protocols in the User setting. Our evaluation also unfolds new relationships between LDP security and its inherent design choices. We found that the hash domain size in local-hashing-based LDP has a profound impact on protocol robustness beyond the well-known effect on utility. Further, we propose a zero-shot attack detection by leveraging the rich reconstructed distribution information. The experiment show that our detection significantly improves the existing methods and effectively identifies data manipulation in challenging scenarios.

> Logic bugs are bugs that can cause database management systems (DBMSs) to silently produce incorrect results for given queries. Such bugs are severe, because they can easily be overlooked by both developers and users, and can cause applications that rely on the DBMSs to malfunction. In this work, we propose Constant-Optimization-Driven Database Testing (CODDTest) as a novel approach for detecting logic bugs in DBMSs. This method draws inspiration from two well-known optimizations in compilers: constant folding and constant propagation. Our key insight is that for a certain database state and query containing a predicate, we can apply constant folding on the predicate by replacing an expression in the predicate with a constant, anticipating that the results of this predicate remain unchanged; any discrepancy indicates a bug in the DBMS. We evaluated CODDTest on five mature and extensively-tested DBMSs-SQLite, MySQL, CockroachDB, DuckDB, and TiDB-and found 45 unique, previously unknown bugs in them. Out of these, 24 are unique logic bugs. Our manual analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches indicates that 11 logic bugs are detectable only by CODDTest. We believe that CODDTest is easy to implement, and can be widely adopted in practice.

> Automatic adversarial prompt generation provides remarkable success in jailbreaking safely-aligned large language models (LLMs). Existing gradient-based attacks, while demonstrating outstanding performance in jailbreaking white-box LLMs, often generate garbled adversarial prompts with chaotic appearance. These adversarial prompts are difficult to transfer to other LLMs, hindering their performance in attacking unknown victim models. In this paper, for the first time, we delve into the semantic meaning embedded in garbled adversarial prompts and propose a novel method that "translates" them into coherent and human-readable natural language adversarial prompts. In this way, we can effectively uncover the semantic information that triggers vulnerabilities of the model and unambiguously transfer it to the victim model, without overlooking the adversarial information hidden in the garbled text, to enhance jailbreak attacks. It also offers a new approach to discovering effective designs for jailbreak prompts, advancing the understanding of jailbreak attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the success rate of jailbreak attacks against various safety-aligned LLMs and outperforms state-of-the-arts by large margins. With at most 10 queries, our method achieves an average attack success rate of 81.8% in attacking 7 commercial closed-source LLMs, including GPT and Claude-3 series, on HarmBench. Our method also achieves over 90% attack success rates against Llama-2-Chat models on AdvBench, despite their outstanding resistance to jailbreak attacks.

> Cross-hospital collaboration has the potential to address disparities in medical resources across different regions. However, strict privacy regulations prohibit the direct sharing of sensitive patient information between hospitals. Vertical federated learning (VFL) offers a novel privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that maximizes data utility across multiple hospitals. Traditional VFL methods, however, primarily benefit patients with overlapping data, leaving vulnerable non-overlapping patients without guaranteed improvements in medical prediction services. While some knowledge transfer techniques can enhance the prediction performance for non-overlapping patients, they fall short in addressing scenarios where overlapping and non-overlapping patients belong to different domains, resulting in challenges such as feature heterogeneity and label heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified vertical federated knowledge transfer framework (Unitrans). Our framework consists of three key steps. First, we extract the federated representation of overlapping patients by employing an effective vertical federated representation learning method to model multi-party joint features online. Next, each hospital learns a local knowledge transfer module offline, enabling the transfer of knowledge from the federated representation of overlapping patients to the enriched representation of local non-overlapping patients in a domain-adaptive manner. Finally, hospitals utilize these enriched local representations to enhance performance across various downstream medical prediction tasks. Experiments on real-world medical datasets validate the framework's dual effectiveness in both intra-domain and cross-domain knowledge transfer. The code of \method is available at \url{https://github.com/Chung-ju/Unitrans}.

> Backscattering tag-to-tag networks (BTTNs) are emerging passive radio frequency identification (RFID) systems that facilitate direct communication between tags using an external RF field and play a pivotal role in ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Despite their potential, BTTNs face significant security vulnerabilities, which remain their primary concern to enable reliable communication. Existing authentication schemes in backscatter communication (BC) systems, which mainly focus on tag-to-reader or reader-to-tag scenarios, are unsuitable for BTTNs due to the ultra-low power constraints and limited computational capabilities of the tags, leaving the challenge of secure tag-to-tag authentication largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a physical layer authentication (PLA) scheme, where a Talker tag (TT) and a Listener tag (LT) can authenticate each other in the presence of an adversary, only leveraging the unique output voltage profile of the energy harvesting and the envelope detector circuits embedded in their power and demodulation units. This allows for efficient authentication of BTTN tags without additional computational overhead. In addition, since the low spectral efficiency and limited coverage range in BTTNs hinder PLA performance, we propose integrating an indoor reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into the system to enhance authentication accuracy and enable successful authentication over longer distances. Security analysis and simulation results indicate that our scheme is robust against various attack vectors and achieves acceptable performance across various experimental settings. Additionally, the results indicate that using RIS significantly enhances PLA performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, especially at longer distances compared to traditional BTTN scenarios without RIS.

> Symbolic execution is an SMT-based software verification and testing technique. Symbolic execution requires tracking performed computations during software simulation to reason about branches in the software under test. The prevailing approach on symbolic execution of binary code tracks computations by transforming the code to be tested to an architecture-independent IR and then symbolically executes this IR. However, the resulting IR must be semantically equivalent to the binary code, making this process complex and error-prone. The semantics of the binary code are specified by the targeted ISA, commonly given in natural language and requiring a manual implementation of the transformation to an IR. In recent years, the use of formal languages to describe ISA semantics in a machine-readable way has gained increased popularity. We investigate the utilization of such formal semantics for symbolic execution of binary code, achieving an accurate representation of instruction semantics. We present a prototype for the RISC-V ISA and conduct a case study to demonstrate that it can be easily extended to additional instructions. Furthermore, we perform an experimental comparison with prior work which resulted in the discovery of five previously unknown bugs in the ISA implementation of the popular IR-based symbolic executor angr.

> Programmers regularly use strings to encode many types of data, such as Unix file paths, URLs, and email addresses, that are conceptually different. However, existing mainstream programming languages use a unified string type to represent them all. As a result, their type systems will keep quiet when a function requiring an email address is instead fed an HTML text, which may cause unexceptional failures or vulnerabilities.   To let the type system distinguish such conceptually different string types, in this paper, we propose to regard \emph{formal languages as types} (FLAT), thereby restricting the set of valid strings by context-free grammars and semantic constraints if needed. To this end, email addresses and HTML text are treated as different types. We realize this idea in Python as a testing framework FLAT-PY. It contains user annotations, all directly attached to the user's code, to (1) define such \emph{language types}, (2) specify pre-/post-conditions serving as \emph{semantic oracles} or contracts for functions, and (3) fuzz functions via random string inputs generated from a \emph{language-based fuzzer}. From these annotations, FLAY-PY \emph{automatically} checks type correctness at runtime via \emph{code instrumentation}, and reports any detected type error as soon as possible, preventing bugs from flowing deeply into other parts of the code. Case studies on real Python code fragments show that FLAT-PY is enable to catch logical bugs from random inputs, requiring a reasonable amount of user annotations.

> The right to privacy, enshrined in various human rights declarations, faces new challenges in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper explores the concept of the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF) within AI systems, contrasting it with traditional data erasure methods. We introduce Forgotten by Design, a proactive approach to privacy preservation that integrates instance-specific obfuscation techniques during the AI model training process. Unlike machine unlearning, which modifies models post-training, our method prevents sensitive data from being embedded in the first place. Using the LIRA membership inference attack, we identify vulnerable data points and propose defenses that combine additive gradient noise and weighting schemes. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our techniques reduce privacy risks by at least an order of magnitude while maintaining model accuracy (at 95% significance). Additionally, we present visualization methods for the privacy-utility trade-off, providing a clear framework for balancing privacy risk and model accuracy. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving AI systems that align with human cognitive processes of motivated forgetting, offering a robust framework for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

> Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that has emerged as an effective way to address recent privacy concerns. However, FL introduces the need for additional security measures as FL alone is still subject to vulnerabilities such as model and data poisoning and inference attacks. Confidential Computing (CC) is a paradigm that, by leveraging hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs), protects the confidentiality and integrity of ML models and data, thus resulting in a powerful ally of FL applications. Typical TEEs offer an application-isolation level but suffer many drawbacks, such as limited available memory and debugging and coding difficulties. The new generation of TEEs offers a virtual machine (VM)-based isolation level, thus reducing the porting effort for existing applications. In this work, we compare the performance of VM-based and application-isolation level TEEs for confidential FL (CFL) applications. In particular, we evaluate the impact of TEEs and additional security mechanisms such as TLS (for securing the communication channel). The results, obtained across three datasets and two deep learning models, demonstrate that the new VM-based TEEs introduce a limited overhead (at most 1.5x), thus paving the way to leverage public and untrusted computing environments, such as HPC facilities or public cloud, without detriment to performance.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate significant potential in various applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can greatly degrade their performance. Existing graph purification methods attempt to address this issue by filtering attacked graphs; however, they struggle to effectively defend against multiple types of adversarial attacks simultaneously due to their limited flexibility, and they lack comprehensive modeling of graph data due to their heavy reliance on heuristic prior knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a more versatile approach for defending against adversarial attacks on graphs. In this work, we introduce the Graph Defense Diffusion Model (GDDM), a flexible purification method that leverages the denoising and modeling capabilities of diffusion models. The iterative nature of diffusion models aligns well with the stepwise process of adversarial attacks, making them particularly suitable for defense. By iteratively adding and removing noise, GDDM effectively purifies attacked graphs, restoring their original structure and features. Our GDDM consists of two key components: (1) Graph Structure-Driven Refiner, which preserves the basic fidelity of the graph during the denoising process, and ensures that the generated graph remains consistent with the original scope; and (2) Node Feature-Constrained Regularizer, which removes residual impurities from the denoised graph, further enhances the purification effect. Additionally, we design tailored denoising strategies to handle different types of adversarial attacks, improving the model's adaptability to various attack scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in defending against a wide range of adversarial attacks, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.

> Transfer learning, successful in knowledge translation across related tasks, faces a substantial privacy threat from membership inference attacks (MIAs). These attacks, despite posing significant risk to ML model's training data, remain limited-explored in transfer learning. The interaction between teacher and student models in transfer learning has not been thoroughly explored in MIAs, potentially resulting in an under-examined aspect of privacy vulnerabilities within transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a new MIA vector against transfer learning, to determine whether a specific data point was used to train the teacher model while only accessing the student model in a white-box setting. Our method delves into the intricate relationship between teacher and student models, analyzing the discrepancies in hidden layer representations between the student model and its shadow counterpart. These identified differences are then adeptly utilized to refine the shadow model's training process and to inform membership inference decisions effectively. Our method, evaluated across four datasets in diverse transfer learning tasks, reveals that even when an attacker only has access to the student model, the teacher model's training data remains susceptible to MIAs. We believe our work unveils the unexplored risk of membership inference in transfer learning.

> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems respond to queries by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge database and applying an LLM to the retrieved documents. We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query - ostensibly because it lacks the relevant information or because the answer is unsafe.   We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. This method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not rely on an auxiliary LLM.   We evaluate jamming attacks on several LLMs and embeddings and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.

> In cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) serve as a vital defensive layer against adversarial threats. Accurate benchmarking is critical to evaluate and improve IDS effectiveness, yet traditional methodologies face limitations due to their reliance on previously known attack signatures and lack of creativity of automated tests. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating IDS through Capture the Flag (CTF) events, specifically designed to uncover weaknesses within IDS. CTFs, known for engaging a diverse community in tackling complex security challenges, offer a dynamic platform for this purpose. Our research investigates the effectiveness of using tailored CTF challenges to identify weaknesses in IDS by integrating them into live CTF competitions. This approach leverages the creativity and technical skills of the CTF community, enhancing both the benchmarking process and the participants' practical security skills. We present a methodology that supports the development of IDS-specific challenges, a scoring system that fosters learning and engagement, and the insights of running such a challenge in a real Jeopardy-style CTF event. Our findings highlight the potential of CTFs as a tool for IDS evaluation, demonstrating the ability to effectively expose vulnerabilities while also providing insights into necessary improvements for future implementations.

> The emergence of quantum computing presents a formidable challenge to the security of blockchain systems. Traditional cryptographic algorithms, foundational to digital signatures, message encryption, and hashing functions, become vulnerable to the immense computational power of quantum computers. This paper conducts a thorough risk assessment of transitioning to quantum-resistant blockchains, comprehensively analyzing potential threats targeting vital blockchain components: the network, mining pools, transaction verification mechanisms, smart contracts, and user wallets. By elucidating the intricate challenges and strategic considerations inherent in transitioning to quantum-resistant algorithms, the paper evaluates risks and highlights obstacles in securing blockchain components with quantum-resistant cryptography. It offers a hybrid migration strategy to facilitate a smooth transition from classical to quantum-resistant cryptography. The analysis extends to prominent blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Zcash, assessing vulnerable components, potential impacts, and associated STRIDE threats, thereby identifying areas susceptible to quantum attacks. Beyond analysis, the paper provides actionable guidance for designing secure and resilient blockchain ecosystems in the quantum computing era. Recognizing the looming threat of quantum computers, this research advocates for a proactive transition to quantum-resistant blockchain networks. It proposes a tailored security blueprint that strategically fortifies each component against the evolving landscape of quantum-induced cyber threats. Emphasizing the critical need for blockchain stakeholders to adopt proactive measures and implement quantum-resistant solutions, the paper underscores the importance of embracing these insights to navigate the complexities of the quantum era with resilience and confidence.

> Recently, the practical needs of ``the right to be forgotten'' in federated learning gave birth to a paradigm known as federated unlearning, which enables the server to forget personal data upon the client's removal request. Existing studies on federated unlearning have primarily focused on efficiently eliminating the influence of requested data from the client's model without retraining from scratch, however, they have rarely doubted the reliability of the global model posed by the discrepancy between its prediction performance before and after unlearning. To bridge this gap, we take the first step by introducing a novel malicious unlearning attack dubbed FedMUA, aiming to unveil potential vulnerabilities emerging from federated learning during the unlearning process. The crux of FedMUA is to mislead the global model into unlearning more information associated with the influential samples for the target sample than anticipated, thus inducing adverse effects on target samples from other clients. To achieve this, we design a novel two-step method, known as Influential Sample Identification and Malicious Unlearning Generation, to identify and subsequently generate malicious feature unlearning requests within the influential samples. By doing so, we can significantly alter the predictions pertaining to the target sample by initiating the malicious feature unlearning requests, leading to the deliberate manipulation for the user adversely. Additionally, we design a new defense mechanism that is highly resilient against malicious unlearning attacks. Extensive experiments on three realistic datasets reveal that FedMUA effectively induces misclassification on target samples and can achieve an 80% attack success rate by triggering only 0.3% malicious unlearning requests.

> Software vulnerabilities pose significant risks to the security and integrity of software systems. Although prior studies have explored vulnerability detection using deep learning and pre-trained models, these approaches often fail to provide the detailed explanations necessary for developers to understand and remediate vulnerabilities effectively. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has introduced transformative potential due to their advanced generative capabilities and ability to comprehend complex contexts, offering new possibilities for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we propose LLMVulExp, an automated framework designed to specialize LLMs for the dual tasks of vulnerability detection and explanation. To address the challenges of acquiring high-quality annotated data and injecting domain-specific knowledge, LLMVulExp leverages prompt-based techniques for annotating vulnerability explanations and finetunes LLMs using instruction tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling LLMVulExp to detect vulnerability types in code while generating detailed explanations, including the cause, location, and repair suggestions. Additionally, we employ a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based key code extraction strategy to focus LLMs on analyzing vulnerability-prone code, further enhancing detection accuracy and explanatory depth. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMVulExp achieves over a 90% F1 score on the SeVC dataset, effectively combining high detection accuracy with actionable and coherent explanations. This study highlights the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection and explanation tasks, providing critical insights into their adaptation and application in software security.

> Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.

> Static analysis is an essential component of many modern software development tools. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes their coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical techniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring the correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are to be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While compiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static analysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it consists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred statically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao assertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion checking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be tested with little effort by combining the following components already present in the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the original program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time checking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is violated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random test cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4) the unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our approach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many bugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or confirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis soundness but also within other aspects of the framework.

> Advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) for machine vision have improved representation robustness and model performance, giving rise to pre-trained backbones like \emph{ResNet} and \emph{ViT} models tuned with SSL methods such as \emph{SimCLR}. Due to the computational and data demands of pre-training, the utilization of such backbones becomes a strenuous necessity. However, employing these backbones may inherit vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. While adversarial robustness has been studied under \emph{white-box} and \emph{black-box} settings, the robustness of models tuned on pre-trained backbones remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the role of tuning meta-information in mitigating exploitation risks is unclear. This work systematically evaluates the adversarial robustness of such models across $20,000$ combinations of tuning meta-information, including fine-tuning techniques, backbone families, datasets, and attack types. We propose using proxy models to transfer attacks, simulating varying levels of target knowledge by fine-tuning these proxies with diverse configurations. Our findings reveal that proxy-based attacks approach the effectiveness of \emph{white-box} methods, even with minimal tuning knowledge. We also introduce a naive "backbone attack," leveraging only the backbone to generate adversarial samples, which outperforms \emph{black-box} attacks and rivals \emph{white-box} methods, highlighting critical risks in model-sharing practices. Finally, our ablations reveal how increasing tuning meta-information impacts attack transferability, measuring each meta-information combination.

> The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, eroding trust, exacerbating inequality, and amplifying harmful narratives. Detecting fake news in multimodal contexts -- where deceptive content combines text and images -- is particularly challenging due to the nuanced interplay between modalities. Existing multimodal fake news detection methods often emphasize cross-modal consistency but ignore the complex interactions between text and visual elements, which may complement, contradict, or independently influence the predicted veracity of a post. To address these challenges, we present Modality Interactive Mixture-of-Experts for Fake News Detection (MIMoE-FND), a novel hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts framework designed to enhance multimodal fake news detection by explicitly modeling modality interactions through an interaction gating mechanism. Our approach models modality interactions by evaluating two key aspects of modality interactions: unimodal prediction agreement and semantic alignment. The hierarchical structure of MIMoE-FND allows for distinct learning pathways tailored to different fusion scenarios, adapting to the unique characteristics of each modality interaction. By tailoring fusion strategies to diverse modality interaction scenarios, MIMoE-FND provides a more robust and nuanced approach to multimodal fake news detection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world benchmarks spanning two languages, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. By enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of fake news detection, MIMoE-FND offers a promising tool to mitigate the spread of misinformation, with the potential to better safeguard vulnerable communities against its harmful effects.

> Existing countermeasures for hardware IP protection, such as obfuscation, camouflaging, and redaction, aim to defend against confidentiality and integrity attacks. However, within the current threat model, these techniques overlook the potential risks posed by a highly skilled adversary with privileged access to the IC supply chain, who may be familiar with critical IP blocks and the countermeasures implemented in the design. To address this scenario, we introduce Library-Attack, a novel reverse engineering technique that leverages privileged design information and prior knowledge of security countermeasures to recover sensitive hardware IP. During Library-Attack, a privileged attacker uses known design features to curate a design library of candidate IPs and employs structural comparison metrics from commercial EDA tools to identify the closest match. We evaluate Library-Attack on transformed ISCAS89 benchmarks to demonstrate potential vulnerabilities in existing IP-level countermeasures and propose an updated threat model to incorporate them.

> The tidal wave of advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their swift integration into application-level logic. Many software systems now use prompts to interact with these black-box models, combining natural language with dynamic values interpolated at runtime, to perform tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to question answering. Due to the programmatic and structured natural language aspects of these prompts, we refer to them as Developer Prompts. Unlike traditional software artifacts, Dev Prompts blend natural language instructions with artificial languages such as programming and markup languages, thus requiring specialized tools for analysis, distinct from classical software evaluation methods.   In response to this need, we introduce PromptDoctor, a tool explicitly designed to detect and correct issues of Dev Prompts. PromptDoctor identifies and addresses problems related to bias, vulnerability, and sub-optimal performance in Dev Prompts, helping mitigate their possible harms. In our analysis of 2,173 Dev Prompts, selected as a representative sample of 40,573 Dev Prompts, we found that 3.46% contained one or more forms of bias, 10.75% were vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. Additionally, 3,310 were amenable to automated prompt optimization. To address these issues, we applied PromptDoctor to the flawed Dev Prompts we discovered. PromptDoctor de-biased 68.29% of the biased Dev Prompts, hardened 41.81% of the vulnerable Dev Prompts, and improved the performance of 37.1% sub-optimal Dev Prompts. Finally, we developed a PromptDoctor VSCode extension, enabling developers to easily enhance Dev Prompts in their existing development workflows.

> Understanding the prevalence, disparities, and symptom variations of Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC) for vulnerable populations is crucial to improving care and addressing intersecting inequities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework for integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) into PCC research by leveraging NLP techniques to analyze disparities and variations in SDOH representation within PCC case reports. Following construction of a PCC Case Report Corpus, comprising over 7,000 case reports from the LitCOVID repository, a subset of 709 reports were annotated with 26 core SDOH-related entity types using pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) models, human review, and data augmentation to improve quality, diversity and representation of entity types. An NLP pipeline integrating NER, natural language inference (NLI), trigram and frequency analyses was developed to extract and analyze these entities. Both encoder-only transformer models and RNN-based models were assessed for the NER objective.   Fine-tuned encoder-only BERT models outperformed traditional RNN-based models in generalizability to distinct sentence structures and greater class sparsity. Exploratory analysis revealed variability in entity richness, with prevalent entities like condition, age, and access to care, and underrepresentation of sensitive categories like race and housing status. Trigram analysis highlighted frequent co-occurrences among entities, including age, gender, and condition. The NLI objective (entailment and contradiction analysis) showed attributes like "Experienced violence or abuse" and "Has medical insurance" had high entailment rates (82.4%-80.3%), while attributes such as "Is female-identifying," "Is married," and "Has a terminal condition" exhibited high contradiction rates (70.8%-98.5%).

> Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior while improving its internal structure. Refactoring engines are integral components of modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and can automate or semi-automate this process to enhance code readability, reduce complexity, and improve the maintainability of software products. Similar to traditional software systems such as compilers, refactoring engines may also contain bugs that can lead to unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called RETESTER, a LLM-based framework for automated refactoring engine testing. Specifically, by using input program structure templates extracted from historical bug reports and input program characteristics that are error-prone, we design chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to perform refactoring-preserving transformations. The generated variants are then tested on the latest version of refactoring engines using differential testing. We evaluate RETESTER on two most popular modern refactoring engines (i.e., ECLIPSE, and INTELLIJ IDEA). It successfully revealed 18 new bugs in the latest version of those refactoring engines. By the time we submit our paper, seven of them were confirmed by their developers, and three were fixed.

> This study investigates the spatial patterns and temporal variations in outage duration, intensity, and restoration/recovery following the 2024 Hurricane Beryl in Houston, Texas. This historic blackout caused widespread power disruptions across the Houston metropolitan area, leaving more than 2 million customers without power over several days, resulting in more than 143 million total customer-out hours.The findings reveal that areas with higher population density and proximity to the hurricane's path experienced more severe initial impacts. Regions with higher median income showed faster recovery, while lower-income areas exhibited prolonged restoration periods, even with favorable infrastructural conditions, suggesting disparities in restoration speed. The study also highlights how urban development features, such as road density and land elevation, explain spatial disparities in power outage impacts and recovery. This research advances the understanding of power outage dynamics in large metropolitan regions through four key contributions: (1) empirical characterization of outages from a historic hurricane, highlighting infrastructure vulnerabilities in a high-density urban context; (2) comprehensive analysis using multiple metrics to capture spatiotemporal dynamics of outages and restoration; (3) leveraging of high-resolution outage data at fine geographic scales and frequent intervals to quantify and reveal previously masked spatial disparities; and (4) systematic examination of socioeconomic, urban development, and environmental factors in shaping disparities in outage impacts and recovery timelines. These findings provide infrastructure managers, operators, utilities, and decision-makers with crucial empirical insights to quantify power outage impacts, justify resilience investments, and address vulnerability and equity issues in the power infrastructure during hazard events.

> Concurrency bugs are hard to discover and reproduce. Prior work has developed sophisticated algorithms to search for concurrency bugs, such as partial order sampling (POS); however, fundamental limitations with existing platforms for concurrency control hinder effective testing of real-world software. We observe that the design space for concurrency control on managed code involves complex trade-offs between expressibility, applicability, and maintainability on the one hand, and bug-finding efficiency on the other hand.   This paper presents Fray, a platform for performing push-button concurrency testing of data-race-free JVM programs. The key insight behind Fray is that effective controlled concurrency testing requires orchestrating thread interleavings without replacing existing concurrency primitives, while encoding their semantics for faithfully expressing the set of all possible program behaviors. Fray incorporates a novel concurrency control mechanism called shadow locking, designed to make controlled concurrency testing practical and efficient for JVM programs. In an empirical evaluation on 53 benchmark programs with known bugs (SCTBench and JaConTeBe), Fray with random search finds 70% more bugs than JPF and 77% more bugs than RR's chaos mode. We also demonstrate Fray's push-button applicability on 2,655 tests from Apache Kafka, Lucene, and Google Guava. In these mature projects, Fray successfully discovered 18 real-world concurrency bugs that can cause 363 tests to fail reproducibly.

- *Mingyuan Fan, Zhanyi Hu, Fuyi Wang, Cen Chen*

- `2501.12736v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12736v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12736v1)

> Data heterogeneity and backdoor attacks rank among the most significant challenges facing federated learning (FL). For data heterogeneity, personalized federated learning (PFL) enables each client to maintain a private personalized model to cater to client-specific knowledge. Meanwhile, vanilla FL has proven vulnerable to backdoor attacks. However, recent advancements in PFL community have demonstrated a potential immunity against such attacks. This paper explores this intersection further, revealing that existing federated backdoor attacks fail in PFL because backdoors about manually designed triggers struggle to survive in personalized models. To tackle this, we design Bad-PFL, which employs features from natural data as our trigger. As long as the model is trained on natural data, it inevitably embeds the backdoor associated with our trigger, ensuring its longevity in personalized models. Moreover, our trigger undergoes mutual reinforcement training with the model, further solidifying the backdoor's durability and enhancing attack effectiveness. The large-scale experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our attack against various PFL methods, even when equipped with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.

> Deep learning based person re-identification (re-id) models have been widely employed in surveillance systems. Recent studies have demonstrated that black-box single-modality and cross-modality re-id models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), leaving the robustness of multi-modality re-id models unexplored. Due to the lack of knowledge about the specific type of model deployed in the target black-box surveillance system, we aim to generate modality unified AEs for omni-modality (single-, cross- and multi-modality) re-id models. Specifically, we propose a novel Modality Unified Attack method to train modality-specific adversarial generators to generate AEs that effectively attack different omni-modality models. A multi-modality model is adopted as the surrogate model, wherein the features of each modality are perturbed by metric disruption loss before fusion. To collapse the common features of omni-modality models, Cross Modality Simulated Disruption approach is introduced to mimic the cross-modality feature embeddings by intentionally feeding images to non-corresponding modality-specific subnetworks of the surrogate model. Moreover, Multi Modality Collaborative Disruption strategy is devised to facilitate the attacker to comprehensively corrupt the informative content of person images by leveraging a multi modality feature collaborative metric disruption loss. Extensive experiments show that our MUA method can effectively attack the omni-modality re-id models, achieving 55.9%, 24.4%, 49.0% and 62.7% mean mAP Drop Rate, respectively.

> When blockchain systems are said to be trustless, what this really means is that all the trust is put into software. Thus, there are strong incentives to ensure blockchain software is correct -- vulnerabilities here cost millions and break businesses. One of the most powerful ways of establishing software correctness is by using formal methods. Approaches based on formal methods, however, induce a significant overhead in terms of time and expertise required to successfully employ them. Our work addresses this critical disadvantage by automating the creation of a formal model -- a mathematical abstraction of the software system -- which is often a core task when employing formal methods. We perform model synthesis in three phases: we first transpile the code into model stubs; then we "fill in the blanks" using a large language model (LLM); finally, we iteratively repair the generated model, on both syntactical and semantical level. In this way, we significantly reduce the amount of time necessary to create formal models and increase accessibility of valuable software verification methods that rely on them. The practical context of our work was reducing the time-to-value of using formal models for correctness audits of smart contracts.

> Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been the target of numerous profit-driven crimes, but the prevalence and cumulative impact of these crimes have not yet been assessed. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of profit-driven crimes targeting the DeFi sector. We collected data on 1141 crime events from 2017 to 2022. Of these, 1036 were related to DeFi (the main focus of this study) and 105 to centralized finance (CeFi). The findings show that the entire cryptoasset industry has suffered a minimum loss of US$30B, with two-thirds related to CeFi and one-third to DeFi. Focusing on DeFi, a taxonomy was developed to clarify the similarities and differences among these crimes. All events were mapped onto the DeFi stack to assess the impacted technical layers, and the financial damages were quantified to gauge their scale. The results highlight that during an attack, a DeFi actor (an entity developing a DeFi technology) can serve as a direct target (due to technical vulnerabilities or exploitation of human risks), as a perpetrator (through malicious uses of contracts or market manipulations), or as an intermediary (by being imitated through, for example, phishing scams). The findings also show that DeFi actors are the first victims of crimes targeting the DeFi industry: 52% of events targeted them, primarily due to technical vulnerabilities at the protocol layer, and these events accounted for 83% of all financial damages. Alternatively, in 41% of events, DeFi actors were themselves malicious perpetrators, predominantly misusing contracts at the cryptoasset layer (e.g. rug pull scams). However, these events accounted for only 17% of all financial damages. The study offers a preliminary assessment of the size and scope of crime events within the DeFi sector and highlights the vulnerable position of DeFi actors in the ecosystem.

- *Mohamed elShehaby, Ashraf Matrawy*

- `2409.07448v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07448v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07448v3)

> As network security threats continue to evolve, safeguarding Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) from adversarial attacks is crucial. This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and presents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS) metric that identifies NIDS features susceptible to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. By quantifying a feature's susceptibility to perturbations within the problem-space, the PS facilitates the selection of features that are inherently more robust against evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS during the feature selection phase. These features exhibit natural resilience to perturbations, as they are heavily constrained by the problem-space limitations and correlations of the NIDS domain. Furthermore, manipulating these features may either disrupt the malicious function of evasion adversarial attacks on NIDS or render the network traffic invalid for processing (or both). This proposed novel approach employs a fresh angle by leveraging network domain constraints as a defense mechanism against problem-space evasion adversarial attacks targeting ML-NIDS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-guided feature selection defense in enhancing NIDS robustness. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS models and public datasets show that selecting only robust features (low-PS features) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks. Additionally, our findings verify that the PS effectively identifies NIDS features highly vulnerable to problem-space perturbations.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities that render them valuable in different applications, including conversational AI products. It is paramount to ensure the security and reliability of these products by mitigating their vulnerabilities towards malicious user interactions, which can lead to the exposure of great risks and reputational repercussions. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the efficacy of fine-tuning and aligning Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses of different LLMs that serve as input moderation guardrails. We systematically explore various tuning methods by leveraging a small set of training data to adapt these models as proxy defense mechanisms to detect malicious inputs and provide a reasoning for their verdicts, thereby preventing the exploitation of conversational agents. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy and robustness of different tuning strategies to generalize across diverse adversarial and malicious query types. Our experimental results outline the potential of alignment processes tailored to a varied range of harmful input queries, even with constrained data resources. These techniques significantly enhance the safety of conversational AI systems and provide a feasible framework for deploying more secure and trustworthy AI-driven interactions.

- `2501.13291v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13291v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13291v1)

> Recent research has revealed that the reported results of an emerging body of DL-based techniques for detecting software vulnerabilities are not reproducible, either across different datasets or on unseen samples. This paper aims to provide the foundation for properly evaluating the research in this domain. We do so by analyzing prior work and existing vulnerability datasets for the syntactic and semantic features of code that contribute to vulnerability, as well as features that falsely correlate with vulnerability. We provide a novel, uniform representation to capture both sets of features, and use this representation to detect the presence of both vulnerability and spurious features in code. To this end, we design two types of code perturbations: feature preserving perturbations (FPP) ensure that the vulnerability feature remains in a given code sample, while feature eliminating perturbations (FEP) eliminate the feature from the code sample. These perturbations aim to measure the influence of spurious and vulnerability features on the predictions of a given vulnerability detection solution. To evaluate how the two classes of perturbations influence predictions, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on five state-of-the-art DL-based vulnerability detectors. Our study shows that, for vulnerability features, only ~2% of FPPs yield the undesirable effect of a prediction changing among the five detectors on average. However, on average, ~84% of FEPs yield the undesirable effect of retaining the vulnerability predictions. For spurious features, we observed that FPPs yielded a drop in recall up to 29% for graph-based detectors. We present the reasons underlying these results and suggest strategies for improving DNN-based vulnerability detectors. We provide our perturbation-based evaluation framework as a public resource to enable independent future evaluation of vulnerability detectors.

> Quantum computing is an emerging field with significant potential, yet software development and maintenance challenges limit its accessibility and maturity. This work investigates the current state, evolution, and maintenance practices in the quantum computing community by conducting a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 quantum software repositories on GitHub, containing more than 1.2 million commits contributed by over 10,000 unique developers. Specifically, the focus of this paper is to: (i) assess the community's status and growth by examining the popularity of quantum computing, trends in programming languages and framework usage, growth of contributors, and insights from repository documentation; and (ii) analyze maintenance practices through commit patterns, issue classification, and maintenance levels. Our findings indicate rapid growth in the quantum computing community, with a 200% increase in the number of repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Our analysis of commits shows a strong focus on perfective updates, while the relatively low number of corrective commits highlights potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, one-third of the quantum computing issues highlight the need for specialized tools in addition to general software infrastructure. In summary, this work provides a foundation for targeted improvements in quantum software to support sustained growth and technical advancement. Based on our analysis of development activity, community structure, and maintenance practices, this study offers actionable recommendations to enhance quantum programming tools, documentation, and resources. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

> Penetration testing is a vital practice for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in cybersecurity systems, but its manual execution is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Existing large language model (LLM)-assisted or automated penetration testing approaches often suffer from inefficiencies, such as a lack of contextual understanding and excessive, unstructured data generation. This paper presents VulnBot, an automated penetration testing framework that leverages LLMs to simulate the collaborative workflow of human penetration testing teams through a multi-agent system. To address the inefficiencies and reliance on manual intervention in traditional penetration testing methods, VulnBot decomposes complex tasks into three specialized phases: reconnaissance, scanning, and exploitation. These phases are guided by a penetration task graph (PTG) to ensure logical task execution. Key design features include role specialization, penetration path planning, inter-agent communication, and generative penetration behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that VulnBot outperforms baseline models such as GPT-4 and Llama3 in automated penetration testing tasks, particularly showcasing its potential in fully autonomous testing on real-world machines.

> Few-shot learning (FSL) enables machine learning models to generalize effectively with minimal labeled data, making it crucial for data-scarce domains such as healthcare, robotics, and natural language processing. Despite its potential, FSL faces challenges including sensitivity to initialization, difficulty in adapting to diverse domains, and vulnerability to noisy datasets. To address these issues, this paper introduces Adaptive Few-Shot Learning (AFSL), a framework that integrates advancements in meta-learning, domain alignment, noise resilience, and multi-modal integration. AFSL consists of four key modules: a Dynamic Stability Module for performance consistency, a Contextual Domain Alignment Module for domain adaptation, a Noise-Adaptive Resilience Module for handling noisy data, and a Multi-Modal Fusion Module for integrating diverse modalities. This work also explores strategies such as task-aware data augmentation, semi-supervised learning, and explainable AI techniques to enhance the applicability and robustness of FSL. AFSL provides scalable, reliable, and impactful solutions for real-world, high-stakes domains.

> Many legal computations, including the amount of tax owed by a citizen, whether they are eligible to social benefits, or the wages due to civil state servants, are specified by computational laws. Their application, however, is performed by expert computer programs intended to faithfully transcribe the law into computer code. Bugs in these programs can lead to dramatic societal impact, e.g., paying employees incorrect amounts, or not awarding benefits to families in need.   To address this issue, we consider concolic unit testing, a combination of concrete execution with SMT-based symbolic execution, and propose CUTECat, a concolic execution tool targeting implementations of computational laws. Such laws typically follow a pattern where a base case is later refined by many exceptions in following law articles, a pattern that can be formally modeled using default logic. We show how to handle default logic inside a concolic execution tool, and implement our approach in the context of Catala, a recent domain-specific language tailored to implement computational laws. We evaluate CUTECat on several programs, including the Catala implementation of the French housing benefits and Section 132 of the US tax code. We show that CUTECat can successfully generate hundreds of thousands of testcases covering all branches of these bodies of law. Through several heuristics, we improve CUTECat's scalability and usability, making the testcases understandable by lawyers and programmers alike. We believe CUTECat thus paves the way for the use of formal methods during legislative processes.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly rely on explicit refusal prefixes for safety, making them vulnerable to prefix injection attacks. We introduce HumorReject, a novel data-driven approach that fundamentally reimagines LLM safety by decoupling it from refusal prefixes through the use of humor as an indirect refusal strategy. Rather than explicitly rejecting harmful instructions, HumorReject responds with contextually appropriate humor that naturally defuses potentially dangerous requests while maintaining engaging interactions. Our approach effectively addresses the common "over-defense" issues in existing safety mechanisms, demonstrating superior robustness against various attack vectors while preserving natural and high-quality interactions on legitimate tasks. Our findings suggest that innovations at the data level are even more fundamental than the alignment algorithm itself in achieving effective LLM safety, opening new directions for developing more resilient and user-friendly AI systems.

> Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Within the scope of privacy preservation, information privacy regulations such as GDPR entitle users to request the removal (or unlearning) of their contribution from a service that is hosting the model. For this purpose, a server hosting an ML model must be able to unlearn certain information in cases such as copyright infringement or security issues that can make the model vulnerable or impact the performance of a service based on that model. While most unlearning approaches in FL focus on Horizontal FL (HFL), where clients share the feature space and the global model, Vertical FL (VFL) has received less attention from the research community. VFL involves clients (passive parties) sharing the sample space among them while not having access to the labels. In this paper, we explore unlearning in VFL from three perspectives: unlearning clients, unlearning features, and unlearning samples. To unlearn clients and features we introduce VFU-KD which is based on knowledge distillation (KD) while to unlearn samples, VFU-GA is introduced which is based on gradient ascent. To provide evidence of approximate unlearning, we utilize Membership Inference Attack (MIA) to audit the effectiveness of our unlearning approach. Our experiments across six tabular datasets and two image datasets demonstrate that VFU-KD and VFU-GA achieve performance comparable to or better than both retraining from scratch and the benchmark R2S method in many cases, with improvements of $(0-2\%)$. In the remaining cases, utility scores remain comparable, with a modest utility loss ranging from $1-5\%$. Unlike existing methods, VFU-KD and VFU-GA require no communication between active and passive parties during unlearning. However, they do require the active party to store the previously communicated embeddings.

> Understanding the prevalence, disparities, and symptom variations of Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC) for vulnerable populations is crucial to improving care and addressing intersecting inequities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework for integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) into PCC research by leveraging NLP techniques to analyze disparities and variations in SDOH representation within PCC case reports. Following construction of a PCC Case Report Corpus, comprising over 7,000 case reports from the LitCOVID repository, a subset of 709 reports were annotated with 26 core SDOH-related entity types using pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) models, human review, and data augmentation to improve quality, diversity and representation of entity types. An NLP pipeline integrating NER, natural language inference (NLI), trigram and frequency analyses was developed to extract and analyze these entities. Both encoder-only transformer models and RNN-based models were assessed for the NER objective.   Fine-tuned encoder-only BERT models outperformed traditional RNN-based models in generalizability to distinct sentence structures and greater class sparsity. Exploratory analysis revealed variability in entity richness, with prevalent entities like condition, age, and access to care, and underrepresentation of sensitive categories like race and housing status. Trigram analysis highlighted frequent co-occurrences among entities, including age, gender, and condition. The NLI objective (entailment and contradiction analysis) showed attributes like "Experienced violence or abuse" and "Has medical insurance" had high entailment rates (82.4%-80.3%), while attributes such as "Is female-identifying," "Is married," and "Has a terminal condition" exhibited high contradiction rates (70.8%-98.5%).

> The Stealth Address Protocol (SAP) allows users to receive assets through stealth addresses that are unlinkable to their stealth meta-addresses. The most widely used SAP, Dual-Key SAP (DKSAP), and the most performant SAP, Elliptic Curve Pairing Dual-Key SAP (ECPDKSAP), are based on elliptic curve cryptography, which is vulnerable to quantum attacks. These protocols depend on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which could be efficiently solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer using the Shor algorithm. In this paper three novel post-quantum SAPs based on lattice-based cryptography are presented: LWE SAP, Ring-LWE SAP and Module-LWE SAP. These protocols leverage Learning With Errors (LWE) problem to ensure quantum-resistant privacy. Among them, Module-LWE SAP, which is based on the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism, achieves the best performance and outperforms ECPDKSAP by approximately 66.8% in the scan time of the ephemeral public key registry.

Various methods have been developed to counteract phishing, each with varying levels of accuracy, but they also face notable limitations. In this study, we introduce PhishAgent, a multimodal agent that combines a wide range of tools, integrating both online and offline knowledge bases with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This combination leads to broader brand coverage, which enhances brand recognition and recall. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal information retrieval framework designed to extract the relevant top k items from offline knowledge bases, using available information from a webpage, including logos and HTML. Our empirical results, based on three real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces both false positives and false negatives, while maintaining model efficiency.

This new development naturally raises questions about the best strategies to defend GNNs against BFAs, a challenge for which no solutions currently exist. Given the applications of GNNs in critical fields, any defense mechanism must not only maintain network performance, but also verifiably restore the network to its pre-attack state. Verifiably restoring the network to its pre-attack state also eliminates the need for costly evaluations on test data to ensure network quality. We offer first insights into the effectiveness of existing honeypot- and hashing-based defenses against BFAs adapted from the computer vision domain to GNNs, and characterize the shortcomings of these approaches. To overcome their limitations, we propose Crossfire, a hybrid approach that exploits weight sparsity and combines hashing and honeypots with bit-level correction of out-of-distribution weight elements to restore network integrity. Crossfire is retraining-free and does not require labeled data. Averaged over 2,160 experiments on six benchmark datasets, Crossfire offers a 21.8% higher probability than its competitors of reconstructing a GNN attacked by a BFA to its pre-attack state. These experiments cover up to 55 bit flips from various attacks. Moreover, it improves post-repair prediction quality by 10.85%. Computational and storage overheads are negligible compared to the inherent complexity of even the simplest GNNs.

> Satellites are highly vulnerable to adversarial glitches or high-energy radiation in space, which could cause faults on the onboard computer. Various radiation- and fault-tolerant methods, such as error correction codes (ECC) and redundancy-based approaches, have been explored over the last decades to mitigate temporary soft errors on software and hardware. However, conventional ECC methods fail to deal with hard errors or permanent faults in the hardware components. This work introduces a detection- and response-based countermeasure to deal with partially damaged processor chips. It recovers the processor chip from permanent faults and enables continuous operation with available undamaged resources on the chip. We incorporate digitally-compatible delay-based sensors on the target processor's chip to reliably detect the incoming radiation or glitching attempts on the physical fabric of the chip, even before a fault occurs. Upon detecting a fault in one or more components of the processor's arithmetic logic unit (ALU), our countermeasure employs adaptive software recompilations to resynthesize and substitute the affected instructions with instructions of still functioning components to accomplish the task. Furthermore, if the fault is more widespread and prevents the correct operation of the entire processor, our approach deploys adaptive hardware partial reconfigurations to replace and reroute the failed components to undamaged locations of the chip. To validate our claims, we deploy a high-energy near-infrared (NIR) laser beam on a RISC-V processor implemented on a 28~nm FPGA to emulate radiation and even hard errors by partially damaging the FPGA fabric. We demonstrate that our sensor can confidently detect the radiation and trigger the processor testing and fault recovery mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the overhead imposed by our countermeasure.

> Adolescence is a critical stage often linked to risky behaviors, including substance use, with significant developmental and public health implications. Social media provides a lens into adolescent self-expression, but interpreting emotional and contextual signals remains complex. This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze adolescents' social media posts, uncovering emotional patterns (e.g., sadness, guilt, fear, joy) and contextual factors (e.g., family, peers, school) related to substance use. Heatmap and machine learning analyses identified key predictors of substance use-related posts. Negative emotions like sadness and guilt were significantly more frequent in substance use contexts, with guilt acting as a protective factor, while shame and peer influence heightened substance use risk. Joy was more common in non-substance use discussions. Peer influence correlated strongly with sadness, fear, and disgust, while family and school environments aligned with non-substance use. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional vulnerabilities and contextual influences, suggesting that collaborative interventions involving families, schools, and communities can reduce risk factors and foster healthier adolescent development.

> We prove new convergence rates for a generalized version of stochastic Nesterov acceleration under interpolation conditions. Unlike previous analyses, our approach accelerates any stochastic gradient method which makes sufficient progress in expectation. The proof, which proceeds using the estimating sequences framework, applies to both convex and strongly convex functions and is easily specialized to accelerated SGD under the strong growth condition. In this special case, our analysis reduces the dependence on the strong growth constant from $\rho$ to $\sqrt{\rho}$ as compared to prior work. This improvement is comparable to a square-root of the condition number in the worst case and address criticism that guarantees for stochastic acceleration could be worse than those for SGD.

> GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their reasoning. While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: compared to conventional RAG, GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval enhance resilience against simple poisoning attacks; meanwhile, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68% poisoning text). We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.

> As large language models (LLMs) have been deployed in various real-world settings, concerns about the harm they may propagate have grown. Various jailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities of these models and improve their safety. This work reveals that many state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to malicious requests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments with GPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, LLama3-405B-Instruct, Llama3-70B-Instruct, Cohere, Gemini models on the StereoSet data demonstrate that, the models' biases and toxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberately misinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supporting the benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also be manipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biases are beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematically jailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies various factors that contribute to the models' vulnerabilities to malicious requests in academic language. Mentioning author names and venues enhances the persuasiveness of some models, and the bias scores can increase as dialogues progress. Our findings call for a more careful investigation on the use of scientific data in the training of LLMs.

> Blockchain-based Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is widely considered as secure communication architecture for a connected transportation system. With the advent of quantum computing, there are concerns regarding the vulnerability of this architecture against cyber-attacks. In this study, a potential threat is investigated in a blockchain-based VANET, and a corresponding quantum cyber-attack is developed. Specifically, a quantum impersonation attack using Quantum-Shor algorithm is developed to break the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encrypted digital signatures of VANET and thus create a threat for the trust-based blockchain scheme of VANET. A blockchain-based VANET, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and vehicular mobility are simulated using OMNET++, the extended INET library, and vehicles-in-network simulation (VEINS) along with simulation of urban mobility (SUMO), respectively. A small key RSA based message encryption is implemented using IBM Qiskit, which is an open-source quantum software development kit. The findings reveal that the quantum cyber-attack, example, impersonation attack is able to successfully break the trust chain of a blockchain-based VANET. This highlights the need for a quantum secured blockchain.

> Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.

> Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications, raising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with jailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus primarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by real-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or predefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during attacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework designed to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of three stages: (1) training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback (Turn-MF), (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the attacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against Gemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a 7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that leverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing decomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack goals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against advanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren.

> The Rust programming language is becoming increasingly popular among systems programmers due to its efficient performance and robust memory safety guarantees. Rust employs an ownership model to ensure this guarantee by allowing each value to be owned by only one identifier at a time. Additionally, it introduces the concept of borrowing and lifetimes to enable other variables to borrow the values under certain conditions temporarily. Despite its benefits, security vulnerabilities have been reported in Rust projects, often attributed to the use of "unsafe" Rust code. These vulnerabilities, in part, arise from incorrect lifetime annotations on function signatures. However, existing tools fail to detect these bugs, primarily because such bugs are rare, challenging to detect through dynamic analysis, and require explicit memory models. To overcome these limitations, first, we characterize incorrect lifetime annotations as a source of memory safety bugs and leverage this understanding to devise a novel static analysis tool, Yuga, to detect potential lifetime annotation bugs. Yuga uses a multi-phase analysis approach, starting with a quick pattern-matching algorithm to identify potential buggy components and then conducting a flow and field-sensitive alias analysis to confirm the bugs. We also curate new datasets of lifetime annotation bugs. Yuga successfully detects bugs with good precision on these datasets, and we make the code and datasets publicly available for review.

> Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong multimodal capabilities but have been found to be more susceptible to generating harmful content compared to their backbone large language models (LLMs). Our investigation reveals that the integration of images significantly shifts the model's internal activations during the forward pass, diverging from those triggered by textual input. Moreover, the safety alignments of LLMs embedded within VLMs are not sufficiently robust to handle the activations discrepancies, making the models vulnerable to even the simplest jailbreaking attacks. To address this issue, we propose an \textbf{internal activation revision} approach that efficiently revises activations during generation, steering the model toward safer outputs. Our framework incorporates revisions at both the layer and head levels, offering control over the model's generation at varying levels of granularity. In addition, we explore three strategies for constructing positive and negative samples and two approaches for extracting revision vectors, resulting in different variants of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the internal activation revision method significantly improves the safety of widely used VLMs, reducing attack success rates by an average of 48.94\%, 34.34\%, 43.92\%, and 52.98\% on SafeBench, Safe-Unsafe, Unsafe, and MM-SafetyBench, respectively, while minimally impacting model helpfulness.

> Recent research has revealed that the reported results of an emerging body of DL-based techniques for detecting software vulnerabilities are not reproducible, either across different datasets or on unseen samples. This paper aims to provide the foundation for properly evaluating the research in this domain. We do so by analyzing prior work and existing vulnerability datasets for the syntactic and semantic features of code that contribute to vulnerability, as well as features that falsely correlate with vulnerability. We provide a novel, uniform representation to capture both sets of features, and use this representation to detect the presence of both vulnerability and spurious features in code. To this end, we design two types of code perturbations: feature preserving perturbations (FPP) ensure that the vulnerability feature remains in a given code sample, while feature eliminating perturbations (FEP) eliminate the feature from the code sample. These perturbations aim to measure the influence of spurious and vulnerability features on the predictions of a given vulnerability detection solution. To evaluate how the two classes of perturbations influence predictions, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on five state-of-the-art DL-based vulnerability detectors. Our study shows that, for vulnerability features, only ~2% of FPPs yield the undesirable effect of a prediction changing among the five detectors on average. However, on average, ~84% of FEPs yield the undesirable effect of retaining the vulnerability predictions. For spurious features, we observed that FPPs yielded a drop in recall up to 29% for graph-based detectors. We present the reasons underlying these results and suggest strategies for improving DNN-based vulnerability detectors. We provide our perturbation-based evaluation framework as a public resource to enable independent future evaluation of vulnerability detectors.

> Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them.   Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.

> Code debugging is a vital stage of software development, essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation task. Human debugging typically follows a multi-stage process, which includes Bug Localization, Bug Identification, Code Repair, and Code Recognition. However, existing code debugging benchmarks predominantly focus on the Code Repair stage, which offers only a limited perspective on evaluating the debugging capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the debugging abilities of LLMs by emulating the multi-stage human debugging process. Through evaluating on DEBUGEVAL, we observe that 7B-scale models consistently underperform compared to their larger counterparts, highlighting their limitations in comprehending code semantics. In this case, we propose the COmmunicative Agent-based data SynThesis (COAST) framework, which employs a multi-agent system to generate high-quality training data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that COAST-generated data outperform human-curated and GPT-4-generated data, enabling 7B-scale LLMs to achieve debugging performance comparable to GPT-3.5.

> Payment channel networks (PCNs) offer a promising solution to address the limited transaction throughput of deployed blockchains. However, several attacks have recently been proposed that stress the vulnerability of PCNs to timelock and censoring attacks. To address such attacks, we introduce Thunderdome, the first timelock-free PCN. Instead, Thunderdome leverages the design rationale of virtual channels to extend a timelock-free payment channel primitive, thereby enabling multi-hop transactions without timelocks. Previous works either utilize timelocks or do not accommodate transactions between parties that do not share a channel.   At its core, Thunderdome relies on a committee of non-trusted watchtowers, known as wardens, who ensure that no honest party loses funds, even when offline, during the channel closure process. We introduce tailored incentive mechanisms to ensure that all participants follow the protocol's correct execution. Besides a traditional security proof that assumes an honest majority of the committee, we conduct a formal game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate the security of Thunderdome when all participants, including wardens, act rationally. We implement a proof of concept of Thunderdome on Ethereum to validate its feasibility and evaluate its costs. Our evaluation shows that deploying Thunderdome, including opening the underlying payment channel, costs approximately \$15 (0.0089 ETH), while the worst-case cost for closing a channel is about \$7 (0.004 ETH).

> Deep learning (DL) has been a common thread across several recent techniques for vulnerability detection. The rise of large, publicly available datasets of vulnerabilities has fueled the learning process underpinning these techniques. While these datasets help the DL-based vulnerability detectors, they also constrain these detectors' predictive abilities. Vulnerabilities in these datasets have to be represented in a certain way, e.g., code lines, functions, or program slices within which the vulnerabilities exist. We refer to this representation as a base unit. The detectors learn how base units can be vulnerable and then predict whether other base units are vulnerable. We have hypothesized that this focus on individual base units harms the ability of the detectors to properly detect those vulnerabilities that span multiple base units (or MBU vulnerabilities). For vulnerabilities such as these, a correct detection occurs when all comprising base units are detected as vulnerable. Verifying how existing techniques perform in detecting all parts of a vulnerability is important to establish their effectiveness for other downstream tasks. To evaluate our hypothesis, we conducted a study focusing on three prominent DL-based detectors: ReVeal, DeepWukong, and LineVul. Our study shows that all three detectors contain MBU vulnerabilities in their respective datasets. Further, we observed significant accuracy drops when detecting these types of vulnerabilities. We present our study and a framework that can be used to help DL-based detectors toward the proper inclusion of MBU vulnerabilities.

> Neural networks have become a fundamental component of numerous practical applications, and their implementations, which are often accelerated by hardware, are integrated into all types of real-world physical devices. User interactions with neural networks on hardware accelerators are commonly considered privacy-sensitive. Substantial efforts have been made to uncover vulnerabilities and enhance privacy protection at the level of machine learning algorithms, including membership inference attacks, differential privacy, and federated learning. However, neural networks are ultimately implemented and deployed on physical devices, and current research pays comparatively less attention to privacy protection at the implementation level. In this paper, we introduce a generic physical side-channel attack, ScaAR, that extracts user interactions with neural networks by leveraging electromagnetic (EM) emissions of physical devices. Our proposed attack is implementation-agnostic, meaning it does not require the adversary to possess detailed knowledge of the hardware or software implementations, thanks to the capabilities of deep learning-based side-channel analysis (DLSCA). Experimental results demonstrate that, through the EM side channel, ScaAR can effectively extract the class label of user interactions with neural classifiers, including inputs and outputs, on the AMD-Xilinx MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA and Raspberry Pi 3 B. In addition, for the first time, we provide side-channel analysis on edge Large Language Model (LLM) implementations on the Raspberry Pi 5, showing that EM side channel leaks interaction data, and different LLM tokens can be distinguishable from the EM traces.

> Since the advent of AFL, the use of mutational, feedback directed, grey-box fuzzers has become critical in the automated detection of security vulnerabilities. A great deal of research currently goes into their optimisation, including improving the rate at which they achieve branch coverage early in a campaign. We produce an augmented version of LibAFL's `fuzzbench' fuzzer, called PrescientFuzz, that makes use of semantic information from the target program's control flow graph (CFG). We develop an input corpus scheduler that prioritises the selection of inputs for mutation based on the proximity of their execution path to uncovered edges. Simple as this idea is, PrescientFuzz leads all fuzzers using the Google FuzzBench at the time of writing -- in both average code coverage and average ranking, across the benchmark SUTs. Whilst the existence of uncovered edges in the CFG does not guarantee their feasibility, the improvement in coverage over the state-of-the-art fuzzers suggests that this is not an issue in practice.

> Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other large language models (LLMs), pose significant challenges to upholding academic integrity in higher education. This paper investigates the susceptibility of a Master's-level cyber security degree program at a UK Russell Group university, accredited by a leading national body, to LLM misuse. Through the application and extension of a quantitative assessment framework, we identify a high exposure to misuse, particularly in independent project- and report-based assessments. Contributing factors, including block teaching and a predominantly international cohort, are highlighted as potential amplifiers of these vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, we discuss the adoption of LLM-resistant assessments, detection tools, and the importance of fostering an ethical learning environment. These approaches aim to uphold academic standards while preparing students for the complexities of real-world cyber security.

<summary>2025-01-24 19:08:09 - PANTS: Practical Adversarial Network Traffic Samples against ML-powered Networking Classifiers</summary>

- *Minhao Jin, Maria Apostolaki*

- `2409.04691v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04691v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04691v2)

> Multiple network management tasks, from resource allocation to intrusion detection, rely on some form of ML-based network traffic classification (MNC). Despite their potential, MNCs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, which can lead to outages, poor decision-making, and security violations, among other issues. The goal of this paper is to help network operators assess and enhance the robustness of their MNC against adversarial inputs. The most critical step for this is generating inputs that can fool the MNC while being realizable under various threat models. Compared to other ML models, finding adversarial inputs against MNCs is more challenging due to the existence of non-differentiable components e.g., traffic engineering and the need to constrain inputs to preserve semantics and ensure reliability. These factors prevent the direct use of well-established gradient-based methods developed in adversarial ML (AML). To address these challenges, we introduce PANTS, a practical white-box framework that uniquely integrates AML techniques with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to generate adversarial inputs for MNCs. We also embed PANTS into an iterative adversarial training process that enhances the robustness of MNCs against adversarial inputs. PANTS is 70% and 2x more likely in median to find adversarial inputs against target MNCs compared to state-of-the-art baselines, namely Amoeba and BAP. PANTS improves the robustness of the target MNCs by 52.7% (even against attackers outside of what is considered during robustification) without sacrificing their accuracy.

- *Xu Yang, Wenhan Zhu, Michael Pacheco, Jiayuan Zhou, Shaowei Wang, Xing Hu, Kui Liu*

- `2501.14983v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14983v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14983v1)

> Detecting vulnerability fix commits in open-source software is crucial for maintaining software security. To help OSS identify vulnerability fix commits, several automated approaches are developed. However, existing approaches like VulFixMiner and CoLeFunDa, focus solely on code changes, neglecting essential context from development artifacts. Tools like Vulcurator, which integrates issue reports, fail to leverage semantic associations between different development artifacts (e.g., pull requests and history vulnerability fixes). Moreover, they miss vulnerability fixes in tangled commits and lack explanations, limiting practical use. Hence to address those limitations, we propose LLM4VFD, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and In-Context Learning to improve the accuracy of vulnerability fix detection. LLM4VFD comprises three components: (1) Code Change Intention, which analyzes commit summaries, purposes, and implications using Chain-of-Thought reasoning; (2) Development Artifact, which incorporates context from related issue reports and pull requests; (3) Historical Vulnerability, which retrieves similar past vulnerability fixes to enrich context. More importantly, on top of the prediction, LLM4VFD also provides a detailed analysis and explanation to help security experts understand the rationale behind the decision. We evaluated LLM4VFD against state-of-the-art techniques, including Pre-trained Language Model-based approaches and vanilla LLMs, using a newly collected dataset, BigVulFixes. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM4VFD significantly outperforms the best-performed existing approach by 68.1%--145.4%. Furthermore, We conducted a user study with security experts, showing that the analysis generated by LLM4VFD improves the efficiency of vulnerability fix identification.

- *Norrathep Rattanavipanon, Ivan De Oliveira Nunes*

> The rise in IoT-driven distributed data analytics, coupled with increasing privacy concerns, has led to a demand for effective privacy-preserving and federated data collection/model training mechanisms. In response, approaches such as Federated Learning (FL) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) have been proposed and attracted much attention over the past few years. However, they still share the common limitation of being vulnerable to poisoning attacks wherein adversaries compromising edge devices feed forged (a.k.a. poisoned) data to aggregation back-ends, undermining the integrity of FL/LDP results.   In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based on a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution (PoSX) for IoT/embedded devices' software. To realize the PoSX concept, we design SLAPP: a System-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. SLAPP leverages commodity security features of embedded devices - in particular ARM TrustZoneM security extensions - to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part of FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security guarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes featuring multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes, showcases SLAPP's security and low overhead.

- *Xiaoguang Li, Zitao Li, Ninghui Li, Wenhai Sun*

- `2403.19510v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19510v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19510v5)

> Recent studies reveal that local differential privacy (LDP) protocols are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks where an attacker can manipulate the final estimate on the server by leveraging the characteristics of LDP and sending carefully crafted data from a small fraction of controlled local clients. This vulnerability raises concerns regarding the robustness and reliability of LDP in hostile environments.   In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of the robustness of state-of-the-art LDP protocols for numerical attributes, i.e., categorical frequency oracles (CFOs) with binning and consistency, and distribution reconstruction. We evaluate protocol robustness through an attack-driven approach and propose new metrics for cross-protocol attack gain measurement. The results indicate that Square Wave and CFO-based protocols in the Server setting are more robust against the attack compared to the CFO-based protocols in the User setting. Our evaluation also unfolds new relationships between LDP security and its inherent design choices. We found that the hash domain size in local-hashing-based LDP has a profound impact on protocol robustness beyond the well-known effect on utility. Further, we propose a zero-shot attack detection by leveraging the rich reconstructed distribution information. The experiment show that our detection significantly improves the existing methods and effectively identifies data manipulation in challenging scenarios.

- `2501.15076v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15076v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15076v1)

> The fields of machine learning (ML) and cryptanalysis share an interestingly common objective of creating a function, based on a given set of inputs and outputs. However, the approaches and methods in doing so vary vastly between the two fields. In this paper, we explore integrating the knowledge from the ML domain to provide empirical evaluations of cryptosystems. Particularly, we utilize information theoretic metrics to perform ML-based distribution estimation. We propose two novel applications of ML algorithms that can be applied in a known plaintext setting to perform cryptanalysis on any cryptosystem. We use mutual information neural estimation to calculate a cryptosystem's mutual information leakage, and a binary cross entropy classification to model an indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (CPA). These algorithms can be readily applied in an audit setting to evaluate the robustness of a cryptosystem and the results can provide a useful empirical bound. We evaluate the efficacy of our methodologies by empirically analyzing several encryption schemes. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to novel network coding-based cryptosystems and provide other use cases for our algorithms. We show that our classification model correctly identifies the encryption schemes that are not IND-CPA secure, such as DES, RSA, and AES ECB, with high accuracy. It also identifies the faults in CPA-secure cryptosystems with faulty parameters, such a reduced counter version of AES-CTR. We also conclude that with our algorithms, in most cases a smaller-sized neural network using less computing power can identify vulnerabilities in cryptosystems, providing a quick check of the sanity of the cryptosystem and help to decide whether to spend more resources to deploy larger networks that are able to break the cryptosystem.

<summary>2025-01-25 06:43:20 - Comprehensive Evaluation of Cloaking Backdoor Attacks on Object Detector in Real-World</summary>

- *Hua Ma, Alsharif Abuadbba, Yansong Gao, Hyoungshick Kim, Surya Nepal*

- `2501.15101v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15101v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15101v1)

> The exploration of backdoor vulnerabilities in object detectors, particularly in real-world scenarios, remains limited. A significant challenge lies in the absence of a natural physical backdoor dataset, and constructing such a dataset is both time- and labor-intensive. In this work, we address this gap by creating a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 11,800 images/frames with annotations featuring natural objects (e.g., T-shirts and hats) as triggers to incur cloaking adversarial effects in diverse real-world scenarios. This dataset is tailored for the study of physical backdoors in object detectors. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of an insidious cloaking backdoor effect against object detectors, wherein the bounding box around a person vanishes when the individual is near a natural object (e.g., a commonly available T-shirt) in front of the detector. Our evaluations encompass three prevalent attack surfaces: data outsourcing, model outsourcing, and the use of pretrained models. The cloaking effect is successfully implanted in object detectors across all three attack surfaces. We extensively evaluate four popular object detection algorithms (anchor-based Yolo-V3, Yolo-V4, Faster R-CNN, and anchor-free CenterNet) using 19 videos (totaling approximately 11,800 frames) in real-world scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the backdoor attack exhibits remarkable robustness against various factors, including movement, distance, angle, non-rigid deformation, and lighting. In data and model outsourcing scenarios, the attack success rate (ASR) in most videos reaches 100% or near it, while the clean data accuracy of the backdoored model remains indistinguishable from that of the clean model, making it impossible to detect backdoor behavior through a validation set.

> Current application designers have moved to integrate large language models (LLMs) into their products. These LLM-integrated applications are vulnerable to prompt injection vulnerabilities. While attempts have been made to address this problem by building a detector that can monitor inputs to the LLM and detect attacks, we find that many detectors are not yet suitable for practical deployment. To support research in this area, we design the PromptShield benchmark for evaluating practical prompt injection detectors. We also construct a new detector, the PromptShield detector, which achieves significantly better performance at detecting prompt injection attacks than any prior scheme. Our work suggests that larger models, more training data, appropriate metrics, and careful curation of training data can contribute to strong detector performance.

> Costs for resolving software defects increase exponentially in late stages. Incomplete or ambiguous requirements are one of the biggest sources for defects, since stakeholders might not be able to communicate their needs or fail to share their domain specific knowledge. Combined with insufficient developer experience, teams are prone to constructing incorrect or incomplete features. To prevent this, requirements engineering has to explore knowledge sources beyond stakeholder interviews. Publicly accessible issue trackers for systems within the same application domain hold essential information on identified weaknesses, edge cases, and potential error sources, all documented by actual users. Our research aims at (1) identifying, and (2) leveraging such issues to improve an agile requirements artifact known as a "user story". We present CrUISE-AC (Crowd and User Informed Suggestion Engine for Acceptance Criteria) as a fully automated method that investigates issues and generates non-trivial additional acceptance criteria for a given user story by employing NLP techniques and an ensemble of LLMs. CrUISE- AC was evaluated by five independent experts in two distinct business domains. Our findings suggest that issue trackers hold valuable information pertinent to requirements engineering. Our evaluation shows that 80-82% of the generated acceptance criteria add relevant requirements to the user stories. Limitations are the dependence on accessible input issues and the fact that we do not check generated criteria for being conflict-free or non-overlapping with criteria from other user stories.

> Fusing visual understanding into language generation, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are revolutionizing visual-language applications. Yet, these models are often plagued by the hallucination problem, which involves generating inaccurate objects, attributes, and relationships that do not match the visual content. In this work, we delve into the internal attention mechanisms of MLLMs to reveal the underlying causes of hallucination, exposing the inherent vulnerabilities in the instruction-tuning process.   We propose a novel hallucination attack against MLLMs that exploits attention sink behaviors to trigger hallucinated content with minimal image-text relevance, posing a significant threat to critical downstream applications. Distinguished from previous adversarial methods that rely on fixed patterns, our approach generates dynamic, effective, and highly transferable visual adversarial inputs, without sacrificing the quality of model responses. Comprehensive experiments on 6 prominent MLLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our attack in compromising black-box MLLMs even with extensive mitigating mechanisms, as well as the promising results against cutting-edge commercial APIs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5.

> Novelty Detection (ND) plays a crucial role in machine learning by identifying new or unseen data during model inference. This capability is especially important for the safe and reliable operation of automated systems. Despite advances in this field, existing techniques often fail to maintain their performance when subject to adversarial attacks. Our research addresses this gap by marrying the merits of nearest-neighbor algorithms with robust features obtained from models pretrained on ImageNet. We focus on enhancing the robustness and performance of ND algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, particularly under adversarial conditions. By incorporating robust pretrained features into the k-NN algorithm, we establish a new standard for performance and robustness in the field of robust ND. This work opens up new avenues for research aimed at fortifying machine learning systems against adversarial vulnerabilities. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/rohban-lab/ZARND.

> As software systems become more complex and configurable, more performance problems tend to arise from the configuration designs. This has caused some configuration options to unexpectedly degrade performance which deviates from their original expectations designed by the developers. Such discrepancies, namely configuration performance bugs (CPBugs), are devastating and can be deeply hidden in the source code. Yet, efficiently testing CPBugs is difficult, not only due to the test oracle is hard to set, but also because the configuration measurement is expensive and there are simply too many possible configurations to test. As such, existing testing tools suffer from lengthy runtime or have been ineffective in detecting CPBugs when the budget is limited, compounded by inaccurate test oracle. In this paper, we seek to achieve significantly faster CPBug testing by neurally prioritizing the testing at both the configuration option and value range levels with automated oracle estimation. Our proposed tool, dubbed NDP, is a general framework that works with different heuristic generators. The idea is to leverage two neural language models: one to estimate the CPBug types that serve as the oracle while, more vitally, the other to infer the probabilities of an option being CPBug-related, based on which the options and the value ranges to be searched can be prioritized. Experiments on several widely-used systems of different versions reveal that NDP can, in general, better predict CPBug type in 87% cases and find more CPBugs with up to 88.88x testing efficiency speedup over the state-of-the-art tools.

> The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant challenges to privacy, particularly as network traffic analysis techniques evolve. While encryption protects data content, traffic attributes such as packet size and timing can reveal sensitive information about users and devices. Existing single-technique obfuscation methods, such as packet padding, often fall short in dynamic environments like smart homes due to their predictability, making them vulnerable to machine learning-based attacks. This paper introduces a multi-technique obfuscation framework designed to enhance privacy by disrupting traffic analysis. The framework leverages six techniques-Padding, Padding with XORing, Padding with Shifting, Constant Size Padding, Fragmentation, and Delay Randomization-to obscure traffic patterns effectively. Evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate significant reductions in classifier performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We assess the framework's robustness against adversarial tactics by retraining and fine-tuning neural network classifiers on obfuscated traffic. The results reveal a notable degradation in classifier performance, underscoring the framework's resilience against adaptive attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate communication and system performance, showing that higher obfuscation levels enhance privacy but may increase latency and communication overhead.

> Modern language models paradoxically combine unprecedented capability with persistent vulnerability in that they can draft poetry yet cannot reliably refuse harmful requests. We reveal this fragility stems not from inadequate training, but from a fundamental architectural limitation: transformers process all tokens as equals. Transformers operate as computational democracies, granting equal voice to all tokens. This is a design tragically unsuited for AGI, where we cannot risk adversarial "candidates" hijacking the system. Through formal analysis, we demonstrate that safety instructions fundamentally lack privileged status in transformer architectures, that they compete with adversarial inputs in the same computational arena, making robust alignment through prompting or fine-tuning inherently limited. This "token democracy" explains why jailbreaks bypass even extensively safety-trained models and why positional shifts erode prompt effectiveness. Our work systematizes practitioners' tacit knowledge into an architectural critique, showing current alignment approaches create mere preferences, not constraints.

> Model fingerprinting is a widely adopted approach to safeguard the intellectual property rights of open-source models by preventing their unauthorized reuse. It is promising and convenient since it does not necessitate modifying the protected model. In this paper, we revisit existing fingerprinting methods and reveal that they are vulnerable to false claim attacks where adversaries falsely assert ownership of any third-party model. We demonstrate that this vulnerability mostly stems from their untargeted nature, where they generally compare the outputs of given samples on different models instead of the similarities to specific references. Motivated by these findings, we propose a targeted fingerprinting paradigm (i.e., FIT-Print) to counteract false claim attacks. Specifically, FIT-Print transforms the fingerprint into a targeted signature via optimization. Building on the principles of FIT-Print, we develop bit-wise and list-wise black-box model fingerprinting methods, i.e., FIT-ModelDiff and FIT-LIME, which exploit the distance between model outputs and the feature attribution of specific samples as the fingerprint, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets verify the effectiveness, conferrability, and resistance to false claim attacks of our FIT-Print.

- `2501.15529v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15529v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15529v1)

> Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is widely applied to safety-critical decision-making scenarios. However, DRL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, especially action-level backdoors, which pose significant threats through precise manipulation and flexible activation, risking outcomes like vehicle collisions or drone crashes. The key distinction of action-level backdoors lies in the utilization of the backdoor reward function to associate triggers with target actions. Nevertheless, existing studies typically rely on backdoor reward functions with fixed values or conditional flipping, which lack universality across diverse DRL tasks and backdoor designs, resulting in fluctuations or even failure in practice.   This paper proposes the first universal action-level backdoor attack framework, called UNIDOOR, which enables adaptive exploration of backdoor reward functions through performance monitoring, eliminating the reliance on expert knowledge and grid search. We highlight that action tampering serves as a crucial component of action-level backdoor attacks in continuous action scenarios, as it addresses attack failures caused by low-frequency target actions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UNIDOOR significantly enhances the attack performance of action-level backdoors, showcasing its universality across diverse attack scenarios, including single/multiple agents, single/multiple backdoors, discrete/continuous action spaces, and sparse/dense reward signals. Furthermore, visualization results encompassing state distribution, neuron activation, and animations demonstrate the stealthiness of UNIDOOR. The source code of UNIDOOR can be found at https://github.com/maoubo/UNIDOOR.

> The rapid expansion of connected devices has made them prime targets for cyberattacks. To address these threats, deep learning-based, data-driven intrusion detection systems (IDS) have emerged as powerful tools for detecting and mitigating such attacks. These IDSs analyze network traffic to identify unusual patterns and anomalies that may indicate potential security breaches. However, prior research has shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers inject triggers into the model to manipulate its behavior and cause misclassifications of network traffic. In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of deep learning-based IDS systems to backdoor attacks in the context of network traffic analysis. We introduce \texttt{PCAP-Backdoor}, a novel technique that facilitates backdoor poisoning attacks on PCAP datasets. Our experiments on real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic datasets demonstrate that attackers can effectively backdoor a model by poisoning as little as 1\% or less of the entire training dataset. Moreover, we show that an attacker can introduce a trigger into benign traffic during model training yet cause the backdoored model to misclassify malicious traffic when the trigger is present. Finally, we highlight the difficulty of detecting this trigger-based backdoor, even when using existing backdoor defense techniques.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.

> Pneumonia, a prevalent respiratory infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations. Chest X-rays serve as a primary tool for pneumonia detection; however, variations in imaging conditions and subtle visual indicators complicate consistent interpretation. Automated tools can enhance traditional methods by improving diagnostic reliability and supporting clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a novel multi-scale transformer approach for pneumonia detection that integrates lung segmentation and classification into a unified framework. Our method introduces a lightweight transformer-enhanced TransUNet for precise lung segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 95.68% on the "Chest X-ray Masks and Labels" dataset with fewer parameters than traditional transformers. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, which are then processed through a modified transformer module to enhance pneumonia detection. This integration of multi-scale feature extraction and lightweight transformer modules ensures robust performance, making our method suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Our approach achieves 93.75% accuracy on the "Kermany" dataset and 96.04% accuracy on the "Cohen" dataset, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of multi-scale transformer architectures to improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to global healthcare challenges."https://github.com/amirrezafateh/Multi-Scale-Transformer-Pneumonia"

This study addresses the urgent need for effective malware detection strategies by leveraging Machine Learning (ML) techniques on extensive datasets collected from Microsoft Windows Defender.

> Federated learning collaboratively trains a neural network on a global server, where each local client receives the current global model weights and sends back parameter updates (gradients) based on its local private data. The process of sending these model updates may leak client's private data information. Existing gradient inversion attacks can exploit this vulnerability to recover private training instances from a client's gradient vectors. Recently, researchers have proposed advanced gradient inversion techniques that existing defenses struggle to handle effectively. In this work, we present a novel defense tailored for large neural network models. Our defense capitalizes on the high dimensionality of the model parameters to perturb gradients within a subspace orthogonal to the original gradient. By leveraging cold posteriors over orthogonal subspaces, our defense implements a refined gradient update mechanism. This enables the selection of an optimal gradient that not only safeguards against gradient inversion attacks but also maintains model utility. We conduct comprehensive experiments across three different datasets and evaluate our defense against various state-of-the-art attacks and defenses. Code is available at https://censor-gradient.github.io.

> How to search for bugs in 1,000 programs using a pre-existing fuzzer and a standard PC? We consider this problem and show that a well-designed strategy that determines which programs to fuzz and for how long can greatly impact the number of bugs found across the programs. In fact, the impact of employing an effective strategy is comparable to that of utilizing a state-of-the-art fuzzer. The considered problem is referred to as fuzzing at scale, and the strategy as scheduler. We show that besides a naive scheduler, that allocates equal fuzz time to all programs, we can consider dynamic schedulers that adjust time allocation based on the ongoing fuzzing progress of individual programs. Such schedulers are superior because they lead both to higher number of total found bugs and to higher number of found bugs for most programs. The performance gap between naive and dynamic schedulers can be as wide (or even wider) as the gap between two fuzzers. Our findings thus suggest that the problem of advancing schedulers is fundamental for fuzzing at scale. We develop several schedulers and leverage the most sophisticated one to fuzz simultaneously our newly compiled benchmark of around 5,000 Ubuntu programs, and detect 4908 bugs.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. LLMs continue to be vulnerable to external threats, particularly Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, prior works tend to focus on performing white-box attacks, overlooking black-box settings. In this work, we propose an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs, called Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS Attack (AutoDoS). AutoDoS introduces DoS Attack Tree and optimizes the prompt node coverage to enhance effectiveness under black-box conditions. Our method can bypass existing defense with enhanced stealthiness via semantic improvement of prompt nodes. Furthermore, we reveal that implanting Length Trojan in Basic DoS Prompt aids in achieving higher attack efficacy. Experimental results show that AutoDoS amplifies service response latency by over 250 $\times \uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuita2333/AutoDoS.

> The integration of large language models with external content has enabled applications such as Microsoft Copilot but also introduced vulnerabilities to indirect prompt injection attacks. In these attacks, malicious instructions embedded within external content can manipulate LLM outputs, causing deviations from user expectations. To address this critical yet under-explored issue, we introduce the first benchmark for indirect prompt injection attacks, named BIPIA, to assess the risk of such vulnerabilities. Using BIPIA, we evaluate existing LLMs and find them universally vulnerable. Our analysis identifies two key factors contributing to their success: LLMs' inability to distinguish between informational context and actionable instructions, and their lack of awareness in avoiding the execution of instructions within external content. Based on these findings, we propose two novel defense mechanisms-boundary awareness and explicit reminder-to address these vulnerabilities in both black-box and white-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our black-box defense provides substantial mitigation, while our white-box defense reduces the attack success rate to near-zero levels, all while preserving the output quality of LLMs. We hope this work inspires further research into securing LLM applications and fostering their safe and reliable use.

> Hate speech on social media threatens the mental and physical well-being of individuals and contributes to real-world violence. Resharing is an important driver behind the spread of hate speech on social media. Yet, little is known about who reshares hate speech and what their characteristics are. In this paper, we analyze the role of user characteristics in hate speech resharing across different types of hate speech (e.g., political hate). For this, we proceed as follows: First, we cluster hate speech posts using large language models to identify different types of hate speech. Then we model the effects of user attributes on users' probability to reshare hate speech using an explainable machine learning model. To do so, we apply debiasing to control for selection bias in our observational social media data and further control for the latent vulnerability of users to hate speech. We find that, all else equal, users with fewer followers, fewer friends, fewer posts, and older accounts share more hate speech. This shows that users with little social influence tend to share more hate speech. Further, we find substantial heterogeneity across different types of hate speech. For example, racist and misogynistic hate is spread mostly by users with little social influence. In contrast, political anti-Trump and anti-right-wing hate is reshared by users with larger social influence. Overall, understanding the factors that drive users to share hate speech is crucial for detecting individuals at risk of engaging in harmful behavior and for designing effective mitigation strategies.

> Payment channel networks (PCNs) offer a promising solution to address the limited transaction throughput of deployed blockchains. However, several attacks have recently been proposed that stress the vulnerability of PCNs to timelock and censoring attacks. To address such attacks, we introduce Thunderdome, the first timelock-free PCN. Instead, Thunderdome leverages the design rationale of virtual channels to extend a timelock-free payment channel primitive, thereby enabling multi-hop transactions without timelocks. Previous works either utilize timelocks or do not accommodate transactions between parties that do not share a channel.   At its core, Thunderdome relies on a committee of non-trusted watchtowers, known as wardens, who ensure that no honest party loses funds, even when offline, during the channel closure process. We introduce tailored incentive mechanisms to ensure that all participants follow the protocol's correct execution. Besides a traditional security proof that assumes an honest majority of the committee, we conduct a formal game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate the security of Thunderdome when all participants, including wardens, act rationally. We implement a proof of concept of Thunderdome on Ethereum to validate its feasibility and evaluate its costs. Our evaluation shows that deploying Thunderdome, including opening the underlying payment channel, costs approximately \$15 (0.0089 ETH), while the worst-case cost for closing a channel is about \$7 (0.004 ETH).

> Multi-task learning is a paradigm that leverages information from related tasks to improve the performance of machine learning. Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) are comments in the code that indicate not-quite-right code introduced for short-term needs, i.e., technical debt (TD). Previous research has provided evidence of a possible relationship between SATD and the existence of vulnerabilities in the code. In this work, we investigate if multi-task learning could leverage the information shared between SATD and vulnerabilities to improve the automatic detection of these issues. To this aim, we implemented VulSATD, a deep learner that detects vulnerable and SATD code based on CodeBERT, a pre-trained transformers model. We evaluated VulSATD on MADE-WIC, a fused dataset of functions annotated for TD (through SATD) and vulnerability. We compared the results using single and multi-task approaches, obtaining no significant differences even after employing a weighted loss. Our findings indicate the need for further investigation into the relationship between these two aspects of low-quality code. Specifically, it is possible that only a subset of technical debt is directly associated with security concerns. Therefore, the relationship between different types of technical debt and software vulnerabilities deserves future exploration and a deeper understanding.

> Cybersecurity threats in complex cyber-physical systems pose significant risks to system functionality and safety. This experience report introduces ACTISM (Automotive Consequence-Driven and Threat-Informed Security Modelling), an integrated security modeling approach that enhances the resilience of automotive systems by dynamically updating their cybersecurity posture in response to prevailing threats, attacker tactics, and their impact on system functionality and safety. ACTISM addresses the existing knowledge gap in static security assessment methodologies by providing a dynamic and iterative framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTISM by applying it to a real-world example of the Tesla Electric Vehicle's In-Vehicle Infotainment system, illustrating how the security model can be adapted as new threats emerge. We also outline avenues for future research and development in this area, including automated vulnerability management workflows for automotive systems.

> Context: Bugs in code are inevitable and can lead to severe consequences, ranging from security vulnerabilities to operational failures. Debugging software remains challenging despite advances in testing and verification, often requiring extensive manual effort. Learning-based automated program repair (APR) has shown promise in reducing the time, effort, and cost of manually fixing bugs. However, existing techniques face several challenges, including language-dependent strategies, limited bug context utilization, and difficulties in handling bugs that span multiple locations in the code.   Objective: This paper introduces MultiMend, a learning-based APR approach designed to improve repair performance on multiple programming languages with language-independent context augmentation and multi-hunk patch generation.   Method: MultiMend fine-tunes a pre-trained encoder-decoder transformer model (CodeT5) to generate bug-fixing patches. It embeds source code lines and applies retrieval-augmented generation to augment the buggy context with relevant lines during patch generation. The approach systematically constructs patches for multi-hunk bugs to reduce the needed patch validations. We evaluate MultiMend on four benchmarks with four programming languages and compare it with state-of-the-art methods.   Results: Experimental results show that MultiMend achieves competitive effectiveness and efficiency against compared tools. Across all benchmarks, MultiMend fixes 2,077 bugs, of which 1,455 are identical to the developer's patch, and 106 are for multi-hunk bugs. Both context augmentation and multi-hunk patch generation positively contribute to the results.   Conclusion: MultiMend shows promising performance across benchmarks. The findings highlight its applicability to real-world software maintenance and its potential to reduce manual debugging efforts.

> Bug fixing holds significant importance in software development and maintenance. Recent research has made substantial strides in exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatically resolving software bugs. However, a noticeable gap in existing approaches lies in the oversight of collaborative facets intrinsic to bug resolution, treating the process as a single-stage endeavor. Moreover, most approaches solely take the buggy code snippet as input for LLMs during the patch generation stage. To mitigate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a novel stage-wise framework named PATCH. Specifically, we first augment the buggy code snippet with corresponding dependence context and intent information to better guide LLMs in generating the correct candidate patches. Additionally, by taking inspiration from bug management practices, we decompose the bug-fixing task into four distinct stages: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification. These stages are performed interactively by LLMs, aiming to simulate the collaborative behavior of programmers during the resolution of software bugs. By harnessing these collective contributions, PATCH effectively enhances the bug-fixing capability of LLMs. We implement PATCH by employing the powerful dialogue-based LLM ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely used bug-fixing benchmark BFP demonstrates that PATCH has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art LLMs.

> The Operating System (OS) kernel is foundational in modern computing, especially with the proliferation of diverse computing devices. However, its development also comes with vulnerabilities that can lead to severe security breaches. Kernel fuzzing, a technique used to uncover these vulnerabilities, poses distinct challenges when compared to userspace fuzzing. These include the complexity of configuring the testing environment and addressing the statefulness inherent to both the kernel and the fuzzing process. Despite the significant interest from the security community, a comprehensive understanding of kernel fuzzing remains lacking, hindering further progress in the field. In this paper, we present the first systematic study dedicated to OS kernel fuzzing. It begins by summarizing the progress of 99 academic studies from top-tier venues between 2017 and 2024. Following this, we introduce a stage-based fuzzing model and a novel fuzzing taxonomy that highlights nine core functionalities unique to kernel fuzzing. These functionalities are examined alongside their corresponding methodological approaches based on qualitative evaluation criteria. Our systematization identifies challenges in meeting functionality requirements and proposes potential technical solutions. Finally, we outline promising and practical future directions to guide forthcoming research in kernel security, supported in part by insights derived from our case study.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to various hardware design tasks, including Verilog code generation, EDA tool scripting, and RTL bug fixing. Despite this extensive exploration, LLMs are yet to be used for the task of post-synthesis metric reasoning and estimation of HDL designs. In this paper, we assess the ability of LLMs to reason about post-synthesis metrics of Verilog designs. We introduce MetRex, a large-scale dataset comprising 25,868 Verilog HDL designs and their corresponding post-synthesis metrics, namely area, delay, and static power. MetRex incorporates a Chain of Thought (CoT) template to enhance LLMs' reasoning about these metrics. Extensive experiments show that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) boosts the LLM's reasoning capabilities on average by 37.0\%, 25.3\%, and 25.7\% on the area, delay, and static power, respectively. While SFT improves performance on our benchmark, it remains far from achieving optimal results, especially on complex problems. Comparing to state-of-the-art regression models, our approach delivers accurate post-synthesis predictions for 17.4\% more designs (within a 5\% error margin), in addition to offering a 1.7x speedup by eliminating the need for pre-processing. This work lays the groundwork for advancing LLM-based Verilog code metric reasoning.

> Deep Learning-based Vulnerability Detection (DLVD) techniques have garnered significant interest due to their ability to automatically learn vulnerability patterns from previously compromised code. Despite the notable accuracy demonstrated by pioneering tools, the broader application of DLVD methods in real-world scenarios is hindered by significant challenges. A primary issue is the "one-for-all" design, where a single model is trained to handle all types of vulnerabilities. This approach fails to capture the patterns of different vulnerability types, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly for less common vulnerabilities that are often underrepresented in training datasets. To address these challenges, we propose MoEVD, which adopts the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for vulnerability detection. MoEVD decomposes vulnerability detection into two tasks, CWE type classification and CWE-specific vulnerability detection. By splitting the task, in vulnerability detection, MoEVD allows specific experts to handle distinct types of vulnerabilities instead of handling all vulnerabilities within one model. Our results show that MoEVD achieves an F1-score of 0.44, significantly outperforming all studied state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines by at least 12.8%. MoEVD excels across almost all CWE types, improving recall over the best SOTA baseline by 9% to 77.8%. Notably, MoEVD does not sacrifice performance on long-tailed CWE types; instead, its MoE design enhances performance (F1-score) on these by at least 7.3%, addressing long-tailed issues effectively.

> LLMs have shown preliminary promise in some security tasks and CTF challenges. However, it is unclear whether LLMs are able to realize multistage network attacks, which involve executing a wide variety of actions across multiple hosts such as conducting reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access, leveraging internal hosts to move laterally, and using multiple compromised hosts to exfiltrate data. We evaluate LLMs across 10 multistage networks and find that popular LLMs are unable to realize these attacks. To enable LLMs to realize these attacks, we introduce Incalmo, an LLM-agnostic high-level attack abstraction layer that sits between an LLM and the environment. Rather than LLMs issuing low-level command-line instructions, which can lead to incorrect implementations, Incalmo allows LLMs to specify high-level tasks (e.g., infect a host, scan a network), which are then carried out by Incalmo. Incalmo realizes these tasks by translating them into low-level primitives (e.g., commands to exploit tools). Incalmo also provides an environment state service and an attack graph service to provide structure to LLMs in selecting actions relevant to a multistage attack. Across 9 out of 10 realistic emulated networks (from 25 to 50 hosts), LLMs using Incalmo can successfully autonomously execute multistage attacks. We also conduct an ablation analysis to show the key role the high-level abstractions play. For instance, we find that both Incalmo's high-level tasks and services are crucial. Furthermore, even smaller-parameter LLMs with Incalmo can fully succeed in 5 of 10 environments, while larger-parameter LLMs without Incalmo do not fully succeed in any.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have found widespread applications in various domains, including web applications, where they facilitate human interaction via chatbots with natural language interfaces. Internally, aided by an LLM-integration middleware such as Langchain, user prompts are translated into SQL queries used by the LLM to provide meaningful responses to users. However, unsanitized user prompts can lead to SQL injection attacks, potentially compromising the security of the database. Despite the growing interest in prompt injection vulnerabilities targeting LLMs, the specific risks of generating SQL injection attacks through prompt injections have not been extensively studied. In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of prompt-to-SQL (P$_2$SQL) injections targeting web applications based on the Langchain framework. Using Langchain as our case study, we characterize P$_2$SQL injections, exploring their variants and impact on application security through multiple concrete examples. Furthermore, we evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating the pervasiveness of P$_2$SQL attacks across language models. Our findings indicate that LLM-integrated applications based on Langchain are highly susceptible to P$_2$SQL injection attacks, warranting the adoption of robust defenses. To counter these attacks, we propose four effective defense techniques that can be integrated as extensions to the Langchain framework. We validate the defenses through an experimental evaluation with a real-world use case application.

> Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them.   Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.

> Improving the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) is a crucial aspect of realizing trustworthy AI systems. Although alignment methods aim to suppress harmful content generation, LLMs are often still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that employ adversarial inputs that subvert alignment and induce harmful outputs. We propose the Randomized Embedding Smoothing and Token Aggregation (RESTA) defense, which adds random noise to the embedding vectors and performs aggregation during the generation of each output token, with the aim of better preserving semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness versus utility tradeoffs compared to the baseline defenses.

> Technical standards are a longstanding method of communicating best practice recommendations based on expert consensus. Cybersecurity standards are particularly important for informing practices that protect critical systems and sensitive data. Measuring standards compliance is therefore essential to identify vulnerabilities arising from continued use of outdated practices and to determine whether expert advice has effectively diffused to practitioners. In this paper, we examine the authentication practices of a diverse set of 136 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada to determine compliance with four standards from NIST Special Publication 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines. These standards have been in place since 2017, pose a relatively low barrier to implementation, yet are substantive revisions from pre-2017 versions, making them an excellent case study for measuring the responsiveness of institutions to updated expert guidance. We find widespread, but not universal, compliance with multi-factor authentication (MFA) standards across institutions. We also find widespread noncompliance with standards for password expiration, password composition rules, and knowledge-based authentication. These results are a wake-up call that many expert cybersecurity recommendations are not effectively reaching practitioners, suggesting a need for alternative outreach strategies, increased investment in education and training initiatives, and an examination of incentive structures that result in noncompliant and insecure practices.

> Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate a method to assess the robustness of LLM alignment. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the target model that is responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance. We seek to extract an approximation of this classifier, called a surrogate classifier, from the LLM. We develop an algorithm for identifying candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM model. We evaluate the degree to which the candidate classifiers approximate the model's embedded classifier in benign (F1 score) and adversarial (using surrogates in a white-box attack) settings. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find attacks mounted on the surrogate models can be transferred with high accuracy. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70%, a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is a viable (and highly effective) means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks.

> Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their exceptional natural language processing capabilities. However, concerns about their trustworthiness remain unresolved, particularly in addressing ``jailbreaking'' attacks on aligned LLMs. Previous research predominantly relies on scenarios involving white-box LLMs or specific, fixed prompt templates, which are often impractical and lack broad applicability. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward and novel method called ObscurePrompt for jailbreaking LLMs, inspired by the observed fragile alignments in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Specifically, we first formulate the decision boundary in the jailbreaking process and then explore how obscure text affects LLM's ethical decision boundary. ObscurePrompt starts with constructing a base prompt that integrates well-known jailbreaking techniques. Powerful LLMs are then utilized to obscure the original prompt through iterative transformations, aiming to bolster the attack's robustness. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach substantially improves upon previous methods in terms of attack effectiveness, maintaining efficacy against two prevalent defense mechanisms.

> Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way forward for automating software engineering tasks, such as bug fixes, feature additions, etc., via multi-step LLM-based agentic workflows. However, existing metrics for evaluating such workflows, mainly build status and occasionally log analysis, are too sparse and limited in providing the information needed to assess the quality of changes made. In this work, we designed LLM-based critics to derive well-structured and rigorous intermediate/step-level, execution-free evaluation proxies for repo-level code changes. Importantly, we assume access to the gold test patch for the problem (i.e., reference-aware) to assess both semantics and executability of generated patches. With the gold test patch as a reference, we predict executability of all editing locations with an F1 score of 91.6%, aggregating which, we can predict the build status in 84.8% of the instances in SWE-bench. In particular, such an execution-focused LLM critic outperforms other reference-free and reference-aware LLM critics by 38.9% to 72.5%. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of such a reference-aware framework in comparing patches generated by different agentic workflows. Finally, we open-source the library developed for this project, which allows further usage for either other agentic workflows or other benchmarks.

> The rapid expansion of connected devices has made them prime targets for cyberattacks. To address these threats, deep learning-based, data-driven intrusion detection systems (IDS) have emerged as powerful tools for detecting and mitigating such attacks. These IDSs analyze network traffic to identify unusual patterns and anomalies that may indicate potential security breaches. However, prior research has shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers inject triggers into the model to manipulate its behavior and cause misclassifications of network traffic. In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of deep learning-based IDS systems to backdoor attacks in the context of network traffic analysis. We introduce \texttt{PCAP-Backdoor}, a novel technique that facilitates backdoor poisoning attacks on PCAP datasets. Our experiments on real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic datasets demonstrate that attackers can effectively backdoor a model by poisoning as little as 1\% or less of the entire training dataset. Moreover, we show that an attacker can introduce a trigger into benign traffic during model training yet cause the backdoored model to misclassify malicious traffic when the trigger is present. Finally, we highlight the difficulty of detecting this trigger-based backdoor, even when using existing backdoor defense techniques.

> Safety alignment mechanism are essential for preventing large language models (LLMs) from generating harmful information or unethical content. However, cleverly crafted prompts can bypass these safety measures without accessing the model's internal parameters, a phenomenon known as black-box jailbreak. Existing heuristic black-box attack methods, such as genetic algorithms, suffer from limited effectiveness due to their inherent randomness, while recent reinforcement learning (RL) based methods often lack robust and informative reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak method leveraging RL, which optimizes prompt generation by analyzing the embedding proximity between benign and malicious prompts. This approach ensures that the rewritten prompts closely align with the intent of the original prompts while enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive jailbreak evaluation framework incorporating keywords, intent matching, and answer validation to provide a more rigorous and holistic assessment of jailbreak success. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several prominent open and closed-source LLMs, including Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and GPT-4o-0806. Our method sets a new benchmark in jailbreak attack effectiveness, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. The codebase for this work is available at https://github.com/Aegis1863/xJailbreak.

> Text watermarking for Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant progress in detecting LLM outputs and preventing misuse. Current watermarking techniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and robustness to text editing. However, current researches lack investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services. This is crucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in real-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service and make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to investigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an identification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through well-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current watermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key, resulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys. Experiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily identified with our well-designed prompts, while Water-Probe demonstrates a minimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. Finally, we propose that the key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase the randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the Water-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys.

> The rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is shifting toward cloudless architectures, removing reliance on centralized cloud services but exposing devices directly to the internet and increasing their vulnerability to cyberattacks. Our research revealed an unexpected pattern of substantial Tor network traffic targeting cloudless IoT devices. suggesting that attackers are using Tor to anonymously exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities (possibly obtained from underground markets). To delve deeper into this phenomenon, we developed TORCHLIGHT, a tool designed to detect both known and unknown threats targeting cloudless IoT devices by analyzing Tor traffic. TORCHLIGHT filters traffic via specific IP patterns, strategically deploys virtual private server (VPS) nodes for cost-effective detection, and uses a chain-of-thought (CoT) process with large language models (LLMs) for accurate threat identification.   Our results are significant: for the first time, we have demonstrated that attackers are indeed using Tor to conceal their identities while targeting cloudless IoT devices. Over a period of 12 months, TORCHLIGHT analyzed 26 TB of traffic, revealing 45 vulnerabilities, including 29 zero-day exploits with 25 CVE-IDs assigned (5 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 16 MEDIUM, and 1 LOW) and an estimated value of approximately $312,000. These vulnerabilities affect around 12.71 million devices across 148 countries, exposing them to severe risks such as information disclosure, authentication bypass, and arbitrary command execution. The findings have attracted significant attention, sparking widespread discussion in cybersecurity circles, reaching the top 25 on Hacker News, and generating over 190,000 views.

<summary>2025-01-28 10:33:30 - Bones of Contention: Exploring Query-Efficient Attacks Against Skeleton Recognition Systems</summary>

> Skeleton action recognition models have secured more attention than video-based ones in various applications due to privacy preservation and lower storage requirements. Skeleton data are typically transmitted to cloud servers for action recognition, with results returned to clients via Apps/APIs. However, the vulnerability of skeletal models against adversarial perturbations gradually reveals the unreliability of these systems. Existing black-box attacks all operate in a decision-based manner, resulting in numerous queries that hinder efficiency and feasibility in real-world applications. Moreover, all attacks off the shelf focus on only restricted perturbations, while ignoring model weaknesses when encountered with non-semantic perturbations. In this paper, we propose two query-effIcient Skeletal Adversarial AttaCks, ISAAC-K and ISAAC-N. As a black-box attack, ISAAC-K utilizes Grad-CAM in a surrogate model to extract key joints where minor sparse perturbations are then added to fool the classifier. To guarantee natural adversarial motions, we introduce constraints of both bone length and temporal consistency. ISAAC-K finds stronger adversarial examples on $\ell_\infty$ norm, which can encompass those on other norms. Exhaustive experiments substantiate that ISAAC-K can uplift the attack efficiency of the perturbations under 10 skeletal models. Additionally, as a byproduct, ISAAC-N fools the classifier by replacing skeletons unrelated to the action. We surprisingly find that skeletal models are vulnerable to large perturbations where the part-wise non-semantic joints are just replaced, leading to a query-free no-box attack without any prior knowledge. Based on that, four adaptive defenses are eventually proposed to improve the robustness of skeleton recognition models.

> Much is promised in relation to AI-supported software development. However, there has been limited evaluation effort in the research domain aimed at validating the true utility of such techniques, especially when compared to human coding outputs. We bridge this gap, where a benchmark dataset comprising 72 distinct software engineering tasks is used to compare the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) and human programmers in producing Python software code. GPT-4 is used as a representative LLM, where for the code generated by humans and this LLM, we evaluate code quality and adherence to Python coding standards, code security and vulnerabilities, code complexity and functional correctness. We use various static analysis benchmarks, including Pylint, Radon, Bandit and test cases. Among the notable outcomes, results show that human-generated code recorded higher ratings for adhering to coding standards than GPT-4. We observe security flaws in code generated by both humans and GPT-4, however, code generated by humans shows a greater variety of problems, but GPT-4 code included more severe outliers. Our results show that although GPT-4 is capable of producing coding solutions, it frequently produces more complex code that may need more reworking to ensure maintainability. On the contrary however, our outcomes show that a higher number of test cases passed for code generated by GPT-4 across a range of tasks than code that was generated by humans. That said, GPT-4 frequently struggles with complex problem-solving that involve in-depth domain knowledge. This study highlights the potential utility of LLMs for supporting software development, however, tasks requiring comprehensive, innovative or unconventional solutions, and careful debugging and error correction seem to be better developed by human programmers. We plot an agenda for the software engineering community.

> Software bugs claim approximately 50% of development time and cost the global economy billions of dollars. Once a bug is reported, the assigned developer attempts to identify and understand the source code responsible for the bug and then corrects the code. Over the last five decades, there has been significant research on automatically finding or correcting software bugs. However, there has been little research on automatically explaining the bugs to the developers, which is essential but a highly challenging task. In this paper, we propose Bugsplainer, a transformer-based generative model, that generates natural language explanations for software bugs by learning from a large corpus of bug-fix commits. Bugsplainer can leverage structural information and buggy patterns from the source code to generate an explanation for a bug. Our evaluation using three performance metrics shows that Bugsplainer can generate understandable and good explanations according to Google's standard, and can outperform multiple baselines from the literature. We also conduct a developer study involving 20 participants where the explanations from Bugsplainer were found to be more accurate, more precise, more concise and more useful than the baselines.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

> Cache side channel attacks are a sophisticated and persistent threat that exploit vulnerabilities in modern processors to extract sensitive information. These attacks leverage weaknesses in shared computational resources, particularly the last level cache, to infer patterns in data access and execution flows, often bypassing traditional security defenses. Such attacks are especially dangerous as they can be executed remotely without requiring physical access to the victim's device. This study focuses on a specific class of these threats: fingerprinting attacks, where an adversary monitors and analyzes the behavior of co-located processes via cache side channels. This can potentially reveal confidential information, such as encryption keys or user activity patterns. A comprehensive threat model illustrates how attackers sharing computational resources with target systems exploit these side channels to compromise sensitive data. To mitigate such risks, a hybrid deep learning model is proposed for detecting cache side channel attacks. Its performance is compared with five widely used deep learning models: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Simple Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves a detection rate of up to 99.96%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing models, the need for enhanced defensive mechanisms, and directions for future research to secure sensitive data against evolving side channel threats.
