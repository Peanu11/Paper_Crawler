<summary>2018-11-09 02:09:31 - Securing Behavior-based Opinion Spam Detection</summary>

- *Shuaijun Ge, Guixiang Ma, Sihong Xie, Philip S. Yu*

- `1811.03739v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03739v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03739v1)

> Reviews spams are prevalent in e-commerce to manipulate product ranking and customers decisions maliciously. While spams generated based on simple spamming strategy can be detected effectively, hardened spammers can evade regular detectors via more advanced spamming strategies. Previous work gave more attention to evasion against text and graph-based detectors, but evasions against behavior-based detectors are largely ignored, leading to vulnerabilities in spam detection systems. Since real evasion data are scarce, we first propose EMERAL (Evasion via Maximum Entropy and Rating sAmpLing) to generate evasive spams to certain existing detectors. EMERAL can simulate spammers with different goals and levels of knowledge about the detectors, targeting at different stages of the life cycle of target products. We show that in the evasion-defense dynamic, only a few evasion types are meaningful to the spammers, and any spammer will not be able to evade too many detection signals at the same time. We reveal that some evasions are quite insidious and can fail all detection signals. We then propose DETER (Defense via Evasion generaTion using EmeRal), based on model re-training on diverse evasive samples generated by EMERAL. Experiments confirm that DETER is more accurate in detecting both suspicious time window and individual spamming reviews. In terms of security, DETER is versatile enough to be vaccinated against diverse and unexpected evasions, is agnostic about evasion strategy and can be released without privacy concern.

- *Jonathan Roux, Eric Alata, Guillaume Auriol, Mohamed KaÃ¢niche, Vincent Nicomette, Romain Cayre*

- `1811.03934v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03934v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03934v1)

> Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are nowadays massively integrated in daily life: homes, factories, or public places. This technology offers attractive services to improve the quality of life as well as new economic markets through the exploitation of the collected data. However, these connected objects have also become attractive targets for attackers because their current security design is often weak or flawed, as illustrated by several vulnerabilities such as Mirai, Blueborne, etc. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting intrusions in smart spaces such as smarthomes, or smartfactories, that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer using machine learning techniques. The approach is designed to be independent of the large and heterogeneous set of wireless communication protocols typically implemented by connected objects such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) or proprietary communication protocols. The main concepts of the proposed approach are presented together with an experimental case study illustrating its feasibility based on data collected during the deployment of the intrusion detection approach in a smart home under real-life conditions.

- *Sergey Gordeychik, Denis Kolegov*

- `1811.04583v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04583v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04583v1)

> Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN or SDWAN) is a modern conception and an attractive trend in network technologies. SD-WAN is defined as a specific application of software-defined networking (SDN) to WAN connections. There is growing recognition that SDN and SD-WAN technologies not only expand features, but also expose new vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, at the present time, most vendors say that SD-WAN are perfectly safe, hardened, and fully protected. The goal of this paper is to understand SD-WAN threats using practical approach. We describe basic SD-WAN features and components, investigate an attack surface, explore various vendor features and their security, explain threats and vulnerabilities found in SD-WAN products. We also extend existing SDN threat models by describing new potential threats and attack vectors, provide examples, and consider high-level approaches for their mitigations. The provided results may be used by SD-WAN developers as a part of Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC), security researchers for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment, system integrators for secure design of SD-WAN solutions, and finally customers for secure deployment operations and configurations of SD-WAN enabled network. The main idea of this work is that SD-WAN threat model involves all traditional network and SDN threats, as well as new product-specific threats, appended by vendors which reinvent or introduce proprietary technologies immature from a security perspective.

> May 30-June 2, 2017, Scholarship for Service (SFS) scholars at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) analyzed the security of a targeted aspect of the UMBC computer systems. During this hands-on study, with complete access to source code, students identified vulnerabilities, devised and implemented exploits, and suggested mitigations. As part of a pioneering program at UMBC to extend SFS scholarships to community colleges, the study helped initiate six students from two nearby community colleges, who transferred to UMBC in fall 2017 to complete their four-year degrees in computer science and information systems.   The study examined the security of a set of "NetAdmin" custom scripts that enable UMBC faculty and staff to open the UMBC firewall to allow external access to machines they control for research purposes. Students discovered vulnerabilities stemming from weak architectural design, record overflow, and failure to sanitize inputs properly. For example, they implemented a record-overflow and code-injection exploit that exfiltrated the vital API key of the UMBC firewall.   This report summarizes student activities and findings, and reflects on lessons learned for students, educators, and system administrators. Our students found the collaborative experience inspirational, students and educators appreciated the authentic case study, and IT administrators gained access to future employees and received free recommendations for improving the security of their systems. We hope that other universities can benefit from our motivational and educational strategy of teaming educators and system administrators to engage students in active project-based learning centering on focused questions about their university computer systems.

- `1810.09683v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09683v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.09683v2)

> In this paper we consider the binary similarity problem that consists in determining if two binary functions are similar only considering their compiled form. This problem is know to be crucial in several application scenarios, such as copyright disputes, malware analysis, vulnerability detection, etc. The current state-of-the-art solutions in this field work by creating an embedding model that maps binary functions into vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Such embedding model captures syntactic and semantic similarity between binaries, i.e., similar binary functions are mapped to points that are close in the vector space. This strategy has many advantages, one of them is the possibility to precompute embeddings of several binary functions, and then compare them with simple geometric operations (e.g., dot product). In [32] functions are first transformed in Annotated Control Flow Graphs (ACFGs) constituted by manually engineered features and then graphs are embedded into vectors using a deep neural network architecture. In this paper we propose and test several ways to compute annotated control flow graphs that use unsupervised approaches for feature learning, without incurring a human bias. Our methods are inspired after techniques used in the natural language processing community (e.g., we use word2vec to encode assembly instructions). We show that our approach is indeed successful, and it leads to better performance than previous state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, we report on a qualitative analysis of functions embeddings. We found interesting cases in which embeddings are clustered according to the semantic of the original binary function.

<summary>2018-11-13 15:56:52 - Universal Decision-Based Black-Box Perturbations: Breaking Security-Through-Obscurity Defenses</summary>

- *Thomas A. Hogan, Bhavya Kailkhura*

- `1811.03733v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03733v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03733v2)

> We study the problem of finding a universal (image-agnostic) perturbation to fool machine learning (ML) classifiers (e.g., neural nets, decision tress) in the hard-label black-box setting. Recent work in adversarial ML in the white-box setting (model parameters are known) has shown that many state-of-the-art image classifiers are vulnerable to universal adversarial perturbations: a fixed human-imperceptible perturbation that, when added to any image, causes it to be misclassified with high probability Kurakin et al. [2016], Szegedy et al. [2013], Chen et al. [2017a], Carlini and Wagner [2017]. This paper considers a more practical and challenging problem of finding such universal perturbations in an obscure (or black-box) setting. More specifically, we use zeroth order optimization algorithms to find such a universal adversarial perturbation when no model information is revealed-except that the attacker can make queries to probe the classifier. We further relax the assumption that the output of a query is continuous valued confidence scores for all the classes and consider the case where the output is a hard-label decision. Surprisingly, we found that even in these extremely obscure regimes, state-of-the-art ML classifiers can be fooled with a very high probability just by adding a single human-imperceptible image perturbation to any natural image. The surprising existence of universal perturbations in a hard-label black-box setting raises serious security concerns with the existence of a universal noise vector that adversaries can possibly exploit to break a classifier on most natural images.

- *Mandar Kulkarni*

- `1811.05521v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05521v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05521v1)

> Deep learning models are vulnerable to external attacks. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to generate adversarial examples for the pre-trained (target) models. We assume a semi black-box setting where the only access an adversary has to the target model is the class probabilities obtained for the input queries. We train a Deep Q Network (DQN) agent which, with experience, learns to attack only a small portion of image pixels to generate non-targeted adversarial images. Initially, an agent explores an environment by sequentially modifying random sets of image pixels and observes its effect on the class probabilities. At the end of an episode, it receives a positive (negative) reward if it succeeds (fails) to alter the label of the image. Experimental results with MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Imagenet datasets demonstrate that our RL framework is able to learn an effective attack policy.

- `1811.06162v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06162v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06162v1)

> We propose a framework for cyber risk assessment and mitigation which models attackers as formal planners and defenders as interdicting such plans. We illustrate the value of plan interdiction problems by first modeling network cyber risk through the use of formal planning, and subsequently formalizing an important question of prioritizing vulnerabilities for patching in the plan interdiction framework. In particular, we show that selectively patching relatively few vulnerabilities allows a network administrator to significantly reduce exposure to cyber risk. More broadly, we have developed a number of scalable approaches for plan interdiction problems, making especially significant advances when attack plans involve uncertainty about system dynamics. However, important open problems remain, including how to effectively capture information asymmetry between the attacker and defender, how to best model dynamics in the attacker-defender interaction, and how to develop scalable algorithms for solving associated plan interdiction games.

- *Jeffrey Pawlick, Juntao Chen, Quanyan Zhu*

- `1805.00403v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00403v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00403v2)

> The cloud-enabled Internet of controlled things (IoCT) envisions a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall "game-of-games," for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer.

- *Adam Rapley, Xavier Bellekens, Lynsay A. Shepherd, Colin McLean*

- `1811.05945v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05945v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05945v2)

> Writing desktop applications in JavaScript offers developers the opportunity to write cross-platform applications with cutting edge capabilities. However in doing so, they are potentially submitting their code to a number of unsanctioned modifications from malicious actors. Electron is one such JavaScript application framework which facilitates this multi-platform out-the-box paradigm and is based upon the Node.js JavaScript runtime --- an increasingly popular server-side technology. In bringing this technology to the client-side environment, previously unrealized risks are exposed to users due to the powerful system programming interface that Node.js exposes. In a concerted effort to highlight previously unexposed risks in these rapidly expanding frameworks, this paper presents the Mayall Framework, an extensible toolkit aimed at JavaScript security auditing and post-exploitation analysis. The paper also exposes fifteen highly popular Electron applications and demonstrates that two thirds of applications were found to be using known vulnerable elements with high CVSS scores. Moreover, this paper discloses a wide-reaching and overlooked vulnerability within the Electron Framework which is a direct byproduct of shipping the runtime unaltered with each application, allowing malicious actors to modify source code and inject covert malware inside verified and signed applications without restriction. Finally, a number of injection vectors are explored and appropriate remediations are proposed.

> This paper introduces Adversarial Resilience Learning (ARL), a concept to model, train, and analyze artificial neural networks as representations of competitive agents in highly complex systems. In our examples, the agents normally take the roles of attackers or defenders that aim at worsening or improving-or keeping, respectively-defined performance indicators of the system. Our concept provides adaptive, repeatable, actor-based testing with a chance of detecting previously unknown attack vectors. We provide the constitutive nomenclature of ARL and, based on it, the description of experimental setups and results of a preliminary implementation of ARL in simulated power systems.

> This paper examines software vulnerabilities in common Python packages used particularly for web development. The empirical dataset is based on the PyPI package repository and the so-called Safety DB used to track vulnerabilities in selected packages within the repository. The methodological approach builds on a release-based time series analysis of the conditional probabilities for the releases of the packages to be vulnerable. According to the results, many of the Python vulnerabilities observed seem to be only modestly severe; input validation and cross-site scripting have been the most typical vulnerabilities. In terms of the time series analysis based on the release histories, only the recent past is observed to be relevant for statistical predictions; the classical Markov property holds.

> In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed an electronic cash system (bitcoin) that is completely realized by peer-to-peer technology. The core value of this scheme is that it proposes a solution based on Proof-of Work, so that the cash system can run in a peer-to-peer environment and be able to prevent double-spend attacks. Bitcoin has been developed for ten years, and since then countless digital currencies have been created. But the discussion of double-spend attacks seems to still concentrate on 51% Attacks. In fact, our research has found that there are many other way to achieve double-spend attacks. In this paper, by introducing a number of double-spend attack vulnerabilities that we have found in EOS, NEO and other large blockchain platforms, we summarized various reasons for causing double-spend attacks, and propose an efficient mitigation measure against them.

> Over the last few years, a rapidly increasing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems that adopt voice as the primary user input have emerged. These systems have been shown to be vulnerable to various types of voice spoofing attacks. Existing defense techniques can usually only protect from a specific type of attack or require an additional authentication step that involves another device. Such defense strategies are either not strong enough or lower the usability of the system. Based on the fact that legitimate voice commands should only come from humans rather than a playback device, we propose a novel defense strategy that is able to detect the sound source of a voice command based on its acoustic features. The proposed defense strategy does not require any information other than the voice command itself and can protect a system from multiple types of spoofing attacks. Our proof-of-concept experiments verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this defense strategy.

> Intel memory protection keys (MPK) is a new hardware feature to support thread-local permission control on groups of pages without requiring modification of page tables. Unfortunately, its current hardware implementation and software supports suffer from security, scalability, and semantic-gap problems: (1) MPK is vulnerable to protection-key-use-after-free and protection-key corruption; (2) MPK does not scale due to hardware limitations; and (3) MPK is not perfectly compatible with mprotect() because it does not support permission synchronization across threads.   In this paper, we propose libmpk, a software abstraction for MPK. libmpk virtualizes protection keys to eliminate the protection-key-use-after-free and protection-key corruption problems while supporting a tremendous number of memory page groups. libmpk also prevents unauthorized writes to its metadata and supports inter-thread key synchronization. We apply libmpk to three real-world applications: OpenSSL, JavaScript JIT compiler, and Memcached for memory protection and isolation. An evaluation shows that libmpk introduces negligible performance overhead (<1%) compared with insecure versions, and improves their performance by 8.1x over secure equivalents using mprotect(). The source code of libmpk will be publicly available and maintained as an open source project.

- `1811.08458v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08458v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08458v1)

> Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, malicious inputs crafted to fool trained models. Adversarial examples often exhibit black-box transfer, meaning that adversarial examples for one model can fool another model. However, adversarial examples may be overfit to exploit the particular architecture and feature representation of a source model, resulting in sub-optimal black-box transfer attacks to other target models. This leads us to introduce the Intermediate Level Attack (ILA), which attempts to fine-tune an existing adversarial example for greater black-box transferability by increasing its perturbation on a pre-specified layer of the source model. We show that our method can effectively achieve this goal and that we can decide a nearly-optimal layer of the source model to perturb without any knowledge of the target models.

- *Robert Annessi, Joachim Fabini, Felix Iglesias, Tanja Zseby*

- `1811.08569v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08569v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08569v1)

> Clock synchronization has become essential to modern societies since many critical infrastructures depend on a precise notion of time. This paper analyzes security aspects of high-precision clock synchronization protocols, particularly their alleged protection against delay attacks when clock synchronization traffic is encrypted using standard network security protocols such as IPsec, MACsec, or TLS. We use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), the most widely used protocol for high-precision clock synchronization, to demonstrate that statistical traffic analysis can identify properties that support selective message delay attacks even for encrypted traffic. We furthermore identify a fundamental conflict in secure clock synchronization between the need of deterministic traffic to improve precision and the need to obfuscate traffic in order to mitigate delay attacks.   A theoretical analysis of clock synchronization protocols isolates the characteristics that make these protocols vulnerable to delay attacks and argues that such attacks cannot be prevented entirely but only be mitigated. Knowledge of the underlying communication network in terms of one-way delays and knowledge on physical constraints of these networks can help to compute guaranteed maximum bounds for slave clock offsets. These bounds are essential for detecting delay attacks and minimizing their impact. In the general case, however, the precision that can be guaranteed in adversarial settings is orders of magnitude lower than required for high-precision clock synchronization in critical infrastructures, which, therefore, must not rely on a precise notion of time when using untrusted networks.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, perturbations carefully crafted to fool the targeted DNN, in both the non-targeted and targeted case. In the non-targeted case, the attacker simply aims to induce misclassification. In the targeted case, the attacker aims to induce classification to a specified target class. In addition, it has been observed that strong adversarial examples can transfer to unknown models, yielding a serious security concern. The NIPS 2017 competition was organized to accelerate research in adversarial attacks and defenses, taking place in the realistic setting where submitted adversarial attacks attempt to transfer to submitted defenses. The CAAD 2018 competition took place with nearly identical rules to the NIPS 2017 one. Given the requirement that the NIPS 2017 submissions were to be open-sourced, participants in the CAAD 2018 competition were able to directly build upon previous solutions, and thus improve the state-of-the-art in this setting. Our team participated in the CAAD 2018 competition, and won 1st place in both attack subtracks, non-targeted and targeted adversarial attacks, and 3rd place in defense. We outline our solutions and development results in this article. We hope our results can inform researchers in both generating and defending against adversarial examples.

> Grey-box fuzzers such as American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) are popular tools for finding bugs and potential vulnerabilities in programs. While these fuzzers have been able to find vulnerabilities in many widely used programs, they are not efficient; of the millions of inputs executed by AFL in a typical fuzzing run, only a handful discover unseen behavior or trigger a crash. The remaining inputs are redundant, exhibiting behavior that has already been observed. Here, we present an approach to increase the efficiency of fuzzers like AFL by applying machine learning to directly model how programs behave. We learn a forward prediction model that maps program inputs to execution traces, training on the thousands of inputs collected during standard fuzzing. This learned model guides exploration by focusing on fuzzing inputs on which our model is the most uncertain (measured via the entropy of the predicted execution trace distribution). By focusing on executing inputs our learned model is unsure about, and ignoring any input whose behavior our model is certain about, we show that we can significantly limit wasteful execution. Through testing our approach on a set of binaries released as part of the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge, we show that our approach is able to find a set of inputs that result in more code coverage and discovered crashes than baseline fuzzers with significantly fewer executions.

> While deep learning has led to remarkable results on a number of challenging problems, researchers have discovered a vulnerability of neural networks in adversarial settings, where small but carefully chosen perturbations to the input can make the models produce extremely inaccurate outputs. This makes these models particularly unsuitable for safety-critical application domains (e.g. self-driving cars) where robustness is extremely important. Recent work has shown that augmenting training with adversarially generated data provides some degree of robustness against test-time attacks. In this paper we investigate how this approach scales as we increase the computational budget given to the defender. We show that increasing the number of parameters in adversarially-trained models increases their robustness, and in particular that ensembling smaller models while adversarially training the entire ensemble as a single model is a more efficient way of spending said budget than simply using a larger single model. Crucially, we show that it is the adversarial training of the ensemble, rather than the ensembling of adversarially trained models, which provides robustness.

- `1811.09310v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09310v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09310v1)

> Recent development in the field of Deep Learning have exposed the underlying vulnerability of Deep Neural Network (DNN) against adversarial examples. In image classification, an adversarial example is a carefully modified image that is visually imperceptible to the original image but can cause DNN model to misclassify it. Training the network with Gaussian noise is an effective technique to perform model regularization, thus improving model robustness against input variation. Inspired by this classical method, we explore to utilize the regularization characteristic of noise injection to improve DNN's robustness against adversarial attack. In this work, we propose Parametric-Noise-Injection (PNI) which involves trainable Gaussian noise injection at each layer on either activation or weights through solving the min-max optimization problem, embedded with adversarial training. These parameters are trained explicitly to achieve improved robustness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses trainable noise injection to improve network robustness against adversarial attacks, rather than manually configuring the injected noise level through cross-validation. The extensive results show that our proposed PNI technique effectively improves the robustness against a variety of powerful white-box and black-box attacks such as PGD, C & W, FGSM, transferable attack and ZOO attack. Last but not the least, PNI method improves both clean- and perturbed-data accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art defense methods, which outperforms current unbroken PGD defense by 1.1 % and 6.8 % on clean test data and perturbed test data respectively using Resnet-20 architecture.

> Coverage-based greybox fuzzing (CGF) is one of the most successful methods for automated vulnerability detection. Given a seed file (as a sequence of bits), CGF randomly flips, deletes or bits to generate new files. CGF iteratively constructs (and fuzzes) a seed corpus by retaining those generated files which enhance coverage. However, random bitflips are unlikely to produce valid files (or valid chunks in files), for applications processing complex file formats.   In this work, we introduce smart greybox fuzzing (SGF) which leverages a high-level structural representation of the seed file to generate new files. We define innovative mutation operators that work on the virtual file structure rather than on the bit level which allows SGF to explore completely new input domains while maintaining file validity. We introduce a novel validity-based power schedule that enables SGF to spend more time generating files that are more likely to pass the parsing stage of the program, which can expose vulnerabilities much deeper in the processing logic.   Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SGF. On several libraries that parse structurally complex files, our tool AFLSmart explores substantially more paths (up to 200%) and exposes more vulnerabilities than baseline AFL. Our tool AFLSmart has discovered 42 zero-day vulnerabilities in widely-used, well-tested tools and libraries; so far 17 CVEs were assigned.

> State-of-the-art classifiers have been shown to be largely vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. One of the most effective strategies to improve robustness is adversarial training. In this paper, we investigate the effect of adversarial training on the geometry of the classification landscape and decision boundaries. We show in particular that adversarial training leads to a significant decrease in the curvature of the loss surface with respect to inputs, leading to a drastically more "linear" behaviour of the network. Using a locally quadratic approximation, we provide theoretical evidence on the existence of a strong relation between large robustness and small curvature. To further show the importance of reduced curvature for improving the robustness, we propose a new regularizer that directly minimizes curvature of the loss surface, and leads to adversarial robustness that is on par with adversarial training. Besides being a more efficient and principled alternative to adversarial training, the proposed regularizer confirms our claims on the importance of exhibiting quasi-linear behavior in the vicinity of data points in order to achieve robustness.

> Audit logs serve as a critical component in the enterprise business systems that are used for auditing, storing, and tracking changes made to the data. However, audit logs are vulnerable to a series of attacks, which enable adversaries to tamper data and corresponding audit logs. In this paper, we present BlockAudit: a scalable and tamper-proof system that leverages the design properties of audit logs and security guarantees of blockchains to enable secure and trustworthy audit logs. Towards that, we construct the design schema of BlockAudit, and outline its operational procedures. We implement our design on Hyperledger and evaluate its performance in terms of latency, network size, and payload size. Our results show that conventional audit logs can seamlessly transition into BlockAudit to achieve higher security, integrity, and fault tolerance.

> Clustering algorithms have become a popular tool in computer security to analyze the behavior of malware variants, identify novel malware families, and generate signatures for antivirus systems. However, the suitability of clustering algorithms for security-sensitive settings has been recently questioned by showing that they can be significantly compromised if an attacker can exercise some control over the input data. In this paper, we revisit this problem by focusing on behavioral malware clustering approaches, and investigate whether and to what extent an attacker may be able to subvert these approaches through a careful injection of samples with poisoning behavior. To this end, we present a case study on Malheur, an open-source tool for behavioral malware clustering. Our experiments not only demonstrate that this tool is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, but also that it can be significantly compromised even if the attacker can only inject a very small percentage of attacks into the input data. As a remedy, we discuss possible countermeasures and highlight the need for more secure clustering algorithms.

> Whenever a bug occurs in a program, software developers assume that the code is flawed, not the compiler. In fact, if compilers should be correct, they are just normal software with their own bugs. Hard to find, errors in them have significant impact, since it could result to vulnerabilities, especially when they silently miscompile a critical application. Using assembly language to write such software is quite common, especially when time constraint is involved in such program.   This paper exposes a bug found in Microsoft Macro Assembler (ml for short) compiler, developed by Microsoft since 1981. This assembly has the characteristics to get high level-like constructs and high level-like records which help the developer to write assembly code. It is in the management of one of this level-like construct the bug has been found.   This study aims to show how a compiler-bug can be audited and possibly corrected. For application developers, it shows that even old and mature compilers can present bugs. For security researcher, it shows possibilities to hide some unexpected behavior in software with a clear and officially non-bogus code. It highlights opportunities for including stealth backdoors even in open-source software.

> Recently, cybersecurity becomes more and more important due to the rapid development of Internet. However, existing methods are in reality highly sensitive to attacks and are far more vulnerable than expected, as they are lack of trustable measures. In this paper, to address the aforementioned problems, we propose a blockchain-based cybersecurity framework, termed as Sapiens Chain, which can protect the privacy of the anonymous users and ensure that the transactions are immutable by providing decentralized and trustable services. Integrating semantic analysis, symbolic execution, and routing learning methods into intelligent auditing, this framework can achieve good accuracy for detecting hidden vulnerabilities. In addition, a revenue incentive mechanism, which aims to donate participants, is built. The practical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

> Increasing numbers of software vulnerabilities are discovered every year whether they are reported publicly or discovered internally in proprietary code. These vulnerabilities can pose serious risk of exploit and result in system compromise, information leaks, or denial of service. We leveraged the wealth of C and C++ open-source code available to develop a large-scale function-level vulnerability detection system using machine learning. To supplement existing labeled vulnerability datasets, we compiled a vast dataset of millions of open-source functions and labeled it with carefully-selected findings from three different static analyzers that indicate potential exploits. The labeled dataset is available at: https://osf.io/d45bw/. Using these datasets, we developed a fast and scalable vulnerability detection tool based on deep feature representation learning that directly interprets lexed source code. We evaluated our tool on code from both real software packages and the NIST SATE IV benchmark dataset. Our results demonstrate that deep feature representation learning on source code is a promising approach for automated software vulnerability detection.

> Neural networks excel in detecting regular patterns but are less successful in representing and manipulating complex data structures, possibly due to the lack of an external memory. This has led to the recent development of a new line of architectures known as Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (MANNs), each of which consists of a neural network that interacts with an external memory matrix. However, this RAM-like memory matrix is unstructured and thus does not naturally encode structured objects. Here we design a new MANN dubbed Relational Dynamic Memory Network (RMDN) to bridge the gap. Like existing MANNs, RMDN has a neural controller but its memory is structured as multi-relational graphs. RMDN uses the memory to represent and manipulate graph-structured data in response to query; and as a neural network, RMDN is trainable from labeled data. Thus RMDN learns to answer queries about a set of graph-structured objects without explicit programming. We evaluate the capability of RMDN on several important prediction problems, including software vulnerability, molecular bioactivity and chemical-chemical interaction. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.

> It has recently been shown that neural networks but also other classifiers are vulnerable to so called adversarial attacks e.g. in object recognition an almost non-perceivable change of the image changes the decision of the classifier. Relatively fast heuristics have been proposed to produce these adversarial inputs but the problem of finding the optimal adversarial input, that is with the minimal change of the input, is NP-hard. While methods based on mixed-integer optimization which find the optimal adversarial input have been developed, they do not scale to large networks. Currently, the attack scheme proposed by Carlini and Wagner is considered to produce the best adversarial inputs. In this paper we propose a new attack scheme for the class of ReLU networks based on a direct optimization on the resulting linear regions. In our experimental validation we improve in all except one experiment out of 18 over the Carlini-Wagner attack with a relative improvement of up to 9\%. As our approach is based on the geometrical structure of ReLU networks, it is less susceptible to defences targeting their functional properties.

> Facebook uses Artificial Intelligence for targeting users with advertisements based on the events in which they engage like sharing, liking, making comments, posts by a friend, a group creation, etcetera. Each user interacts with these events in different ways, thus receiving different recommendations curated by Facebook's intelligent systems. Facebook segregates its users into chambers, fragmenting them into communities. The technology has completely changed the marketing domain. It is however caught in a race for our finite attention with a motive to make more and more money. Facebook is not a neutral product. It is programmed to get users addicted to it with a goal of gaining added information about the users and optimizing the recommendations provided to the users according to his or her preferences.

> Despite the growing popularity of modern machine learning techniques (e.g. Deep Neural Networks) in cyber-security applications, most of these models are perceived as a black-box for the user. Adversarial machine learning offers an approach to increase our understanding of these models. In this paper we present an approach to generate explanations for incorrect classifications made by data-driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). An adversarial approach is used to find the minimum modifications (of the input features) required to correctly classify a given set of misclassified samples. The magnitude of such modifications is used to visualize the most relevant features that explain the reason for the misclassification. The presented methodology generated satisfactory explanations that describe the reasoning behind the mis-classifications, with descriptions that match expert knowledge. The advantages of the presented methodology are: 1) applicable to any classifier with defined gradients. 2) does not require any modification of the classifier model. 3) can be extended to perform further diagnosis (e.g. vulnerability assessment) and gain further understanding of the system. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the NSL-KDD99 benchmark dataset using Linear and Multilayer perceptron classifiers. The results are shown using intuitive visualizations in order to improve the interpretability of the results.

> The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) released its first 5G security specifications in March 2018. This paper reviews the 5G security architecture, requirements and main processes and evaluates them in the context of known and new protocol exploits. Although the security has been enhanced when compared to previous generations to tackle known protocol exploits, our analysis identifies some potentially unrealistic system assumptions that are critical for security as well as a number protocol edge cases that could render 5G systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For example, null encryption and null authentication are supported and can be used in valid system configurations, and certain key security functions are still left outside of the scope of the specifications. Moreover, the prevention of pre-authentcation message exploits appears to rely on the implicit assumption of impractical carrier and roaming agreements and the management of public keys from all global operators. In parallel, existing threats such as International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers are prevented only if the serving network enforces optional security features and if the UE knows the public key of the home network operator. The comparison with 4G LTE protocol exploits reveals that the 5G security specifications, as of Release 15, do not fully address the user privacy and network availability concerns, where one edge case can compromise the privacy, security and availability of 5G users and services.

> Several recent studies have demonstrated the promise of deep visuomotor policies for robot manipulator control. Despite impressive progress, these systems are known to be vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as accidental or adversarial bumps that make them drop the manipulated object. They also tend to be distracted by visual disturbances such as objects moving in the robot's field of view, even if the disturbance does not physically prevent the execution of the task. In this paper, we propose an approach for augmenting a deep visuomotor policy trained through demonstrations with Task Focused visual Attention (TFA). The manipulation task is specified with a natural language text such as `move the red bowl to the left'. This allows the visual attention component to concentrate on the current object that the robot needs to manipulate. We show that even in benign environments, the TFA allows the policy to consistently outperform a variant with no attention mechanism. More importantly, the new policy is significantly more robust: it regularly recovers from severe physical disturbances (such as bumps causing it to drop the object) from which the baseline policy, i.e. with no visual attention, almost never recovers. In addition, we show that the proposed policy performs correctly in the presence of a wide class of visual disturbances, exhibiting a behavior reminiscent of human selective visual attention experiments. Our proposed approach consists of a VAE-GAN network which encodes the visual input and feeds it to a Motor network that moves the robot joints. Also, our approach benefits from a teacher network for the TFA that leverages textual input command to robustify the visual encoder against various types of disturbances.

> Since 2016, all of four major U.S. operators have rolled out nationwide Wi-Fi calling services. They are projected to surpass VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and other VoIP services in terms of mobile IP voice usage minutes in 2018. They enable mobile users to place cellular calls over Wi-Fi networks based on the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) technology. Compared with conventional cellular voice solutions, the major difference lies in that their traffic traverses untrustful Wi-Fi networks and the Internet. This exposure to insecure networks may cause the Wi-Fi calling users to suffer from security threats. Its security mechanisms are similar to the VoLTE, because both of them are supported by the IMS. They include SIM-based security, 3GPP AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement), IPSec (Internet Protocol Security), etc. However, are they sufficient to secure Wi-Fi calling services? Unfortunately, our study yields a negative answer. We conduct the first study of exploring security issues of the operational Wi-Fi calling services in three major U.S. operators' networks using commodity devices. We disclose that current Wi-Fi calling security is not bullet-proof and uncover four vulnerabilities which stem from improper standard designs, device implementation issues and network operation slips. By exploiting the vulnerabilities, together with several state-of-the-art computer visual recognition technologies, we devise two proof-of-concept attacks: user privacy leakage and telephony harassment or denial of voice service (THDoS); both of them can bypass the security defenses deployed on mobile devices and the network infrastructure. We have confirmed their feasibility and simplicity using real-world experiments, as well as assessed their potential damages and proposed recommended solutions.

> Verifying robustness of neural network classifiers has attracted great interests and attention due to the success of deep neural networks and their unexpected vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. Although finding minimum adversarial distortion of neural networks (with ReLU activations) has been shown to be an NP-complete problem, obtaining a non-trivial lower bound of minimum distortion as a provable robustness guarantee is possible. However, most previous works only focused on simple fully-connected layers (multilayer perceptrons) and were limited to ReLU activations. This motivates us to propose a general and efficient framework, CNN-Cert, that is capable of certifying robustness on general convolutional neural networks. Our framework is general -- we can handle various architectures including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization layer, residual blocks, as well as general activation functions; our approach is efficient -- by exploiting the special structure of convolutional layers, we achieve up to 17 and 11 times of speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art certification algorithms (e.g. Fast-Lin, CROWN) and 366 times of speed-up compared to the dual-LP approach while our algorithm obtains similar or even better verification bounds. In addition, CNN-Cert generalizes state-of-the-art algorithms e.g. Fast-Lin and CROWN. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art lower-bound-based certification algorithms in terms of both bound quality and speed.

> Social Virtual Reality based Learning Environments (VRLEs) such as vSocial render instructional content in a three-dimensional immersive computer experience for training youth with learning impediments. There are limited prior works that explored attack vulnerability in VR technology, and hence there is a need for systematic frameworks to quantify risks corresponding to security, privacy, and safety (SPS) threats. The SPS threats can adversely impact the educational user experience and hinder delivery of VRLE content. In this paper, we propose a novel risk assessment framework that utilizes attack trees to calculate a risk score for varied VRLE threats with rate and duration of threats as inputs. We compare the impact of a well-constructed attack tree with an adhoc attack tree to study the trade-offs between overheads in managing attack trees, and the cost of risk mitigation when vulnerabilities are identified. We use a vSocial VRLE testbed in a case study to showcase the effectiveness of our framework and demonstrate how a suitable attack tree formalism can result in a more safer, privacy-preserving and secure VRLE system.

> Commodity OS kernels have broad attack surfaces due to the large code base and the numerous features such as device drivers. For a real-world use case (e.g., an Apache Server), many kernel services are unused and only a small amount of kernel code is used. Within the used code, a certain part is invoked only at runtime while the rest are executed at startup and/or shutdown phases in the kernel's lifetime run. In this paper, we propose a reliable and practical system, named KASR, which transparently reduces attack surfaces of commodity OS kernels at runtime without requiring their source code. The KASR system, residing in a trusted hypervisor, achieves the attack surface reduction through a two-step approach: (1) reliably depriving unused code of executable permissions, and (2) transparently segmenting used code and selectively activating them. We implement a prototype of KASR on Xen-4.8.2 hypervisor and evaluate its security effectiveness on Linux kernel-4.4.0-87-generic. Our evaluation shows that KASR reduces the kernel attack surface by 64% and trims off 40% of CVE vulnerabilities. Besides, KASR successfully detects and blocks all 6 real-world kernel rootkits. We measure its performance overhead with three benchmark tools (i.e., SPECINT, httperf and bonnie++). The experimental results indicate that KASR imposes less than 1% performance overhead (compared to an unmodified Xen hypervisor) on all the benchmarks.

> Detecting and mapping informal settlements encompasses several of the United Nations sustainable development goals. This is because informal settlements are home to the most socially and economically vulnerable people on the planet. Thus, understanding where these settlements are is of paramount importance to both government and non-government organizations (NGOs), such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), who can use this information to deliver effective social and economic aid. We propose two effective methods for detecting and mapping the locations of informal settlements. One uses only low-resolution (LR), freely available, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery with noisy annotations, whilst the other is a deep learning approach that uses only costly very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. To our knowledge, we are the first to map informal settlements successfully with low-resolution satellite imagery. We extensively evaluate and compare the proposed methods.

> Mobility datasets are fundamental for evaluating algorithms pertaining to geographic information systems and facilitating experimental reproducibility. But privacy implications restrict sharing such datasets, as even aggregated location-data is vulnerable to membership inference attacks. Current synthetic mobility dataset generators attempt to superficially match a priori modeled mobility characteristics which do not accurately reflect the real-world characteristics. Modeling human mobility to generate synthetic yet semantically and statistically realistic trajectories is therefore crucial for publishing trajectory datasets having satisfactory utility level while preserving user privacy. Specifically, long-range dependencies inherent to human mobility are challenging to capture with both discriminative and generative models. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of recurrent neural architectures (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs) and nonparametric copulas to generate synthetic mobility traces. We evaluate the generated trajectories with respect to their geographic and semantic similarity, circadian rhythms, long-range dependencies, training and generation time. We also include two sample tests to assess statistical similarity between the observed and simulated distributions, and we analyze the privacy tradeoffs with respect to membership inference and location-sequence attacks.

> Despite achieving impressive performance, state-of-the-art classifiers remain highly vulnerable to small, imperceptible, adversarial perturbations. This vulnerability has proven empirically to be very intricate to address. In this paper, we study the phenomenon of adversarial perturbations under the assumption that the data is generated with a smooth generative model. We derive fundamental upper bounds on the robustness to perturbations of any classification function, and prove the existence of adversarial perturbations that transfer well across different classifiers with small risk. Our analysis of the robustness also provides insights onto key properties of generative models, such as their smoothness and dimensionality of latent space. We conclude with numerical experimental results showing that our bounds provide informative baselines to the maximal achievable robustness on several datasets.

> Packaging software into containers is becoming a common practice when deploying services in cloud and other environments. Docker images are one of the most popular container technologies for building and deploying containers. A container image usually includes a collection of software packages, that can have bugs and security vulnerabilities that affect the container health. Our goal is to support container deployers by analysing the relation between outdated containers and vulnerable and buggy packages installed in them. We use the concept of technical lag of a container as the difference between a given container and the most up-to-date container that is possible with the most recent releases of the same collection of packages. For 7,380 official and community Docker images that are based on the Debian Linux distribution, we identify which software packages are installed in them and measure their technical lag in terms of version updates, security vulnerabilities and bugs. We have found, among others, that no release is devoid of vulnerabilities, so deployers cannot avoid vulnerabilities even if they deploy the most recent packages. We offer some lessons learned for container developers in regard to the strategies they can follow to minimize the number of vulnerabilities. We argue that Docker container scan and security management tools should improve their platforms by adding data about other kinds of bugs and include the measurement of technical lag to offer deployers information of when to update.

> In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing the existing approaches to detect hardware vulnerabilities during the design phase. We show that a protection gap currently exists in practice that leaves chip designs vulnerable to software-based attacks. In particular, existing verification approaches fail to detect specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we call HardFails: these bugs evade detection by current verification techniques while being exploitable from software. We demonstrate such vulnerabilities in real-world SoCs using RISC-V to showcase and analyze concrete instantiations of HardFails. Patching these hardware bugs may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product recall. We base our findings on two extensive case studies: the recent Hack@DAC 2018 hardware security competition, where 54 independent teams of researchers competed world-wide over a period of 12 weeks to catch inserted security bugs in SoC RTL designs, and an in-depth systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art verification approaches. Our findings indicate that even combinations of techniques will miss high-impact bugs due to the large number of modules with complex interdependencies and fundamental limitations of current detection approaches. We also craft a real-world software attack that exploits one of the RTL bugs from Hack@DAC that evaded detection and discuss novel approaches to mitigate the growing problem of cross-layer bugs at design time.

> Machine learning models have been shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks launched by adversarial examples which are carefully crafted by attacker to defeat classifiers. Deep learning models cannot escape the attack either. Most of adversarial attack methods are focused on success rate or perturbations size, while we are more interested in the relationship between adversarial perturbation and the image itself. In this paper, we put forward a novel adversarial attack based on contour, named FineFool. Finefool not only has better attack performance compared with other state-of-art white-box attacks in aspect of higher attack success rate and smaller perturbation, but also capable of visualization the optimal adversarial perturbation via attention on object contour. To the best of our knowledge, Finefool is for the first time combines the critical feature of the original clean image with the optimal perturbations in a visible manner. Inspired by the correlations between adversarial perturbations and object contour, slighter perturbations is produced via focusing on object contour features, which is more imperceptible and difficult to be defended, especially network add-on defense methods with the trade-off between perturbations filtering and contour feature loss. Compared with existing state-of-art attacks, extensive experiments are conducted to show that Finefool is capable of efficient attack against defensive deep models.

> Android adopted SELinux's mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms in 2013. Since then, billions of Android devices have benefited from mandatory access control security policies. These policies are expressed in a variety of rules, maintained by Google and extended by Android OEMs. Over the years, the rules have grown to be quite complex, making it challenging to properly understand or configure these policies.   In this paper, we perform a measurement study on the SEAndroid repository to understand the evolution of these policies. We propose a new metric to measure the complexity of the policy by expanding policy rules, with their abstraction features such as macros and groups, into primitive "boxes", which we then use to show that the complexity of the SEAndroid policies has been growing exponentially over time. By analyzing the Git commits, snapshot by snapshot, we are also able to analyze the "age" of policy rules, the trend of changes, and the contributor composition. We also look at hallmark events in Android's history, such as the "Stagefright" vulnerability in Android's media facilities, pointing out how these events led to changes in the MAC policies. The growing complexity of Android's mandatory policies suggests that we will eventually hit the limits of our ability to understand these policies, requiring new tools and techniques.

> Several researchers have proposed solutions for secure data outsourcing on the public clouds based on encryption, secret-sharing, and trusted hardware. Existing approaches, however, exhibit many limitations including high computational complexity, imperfect security, and information leakage. This chapter describes an emerging trend in secure data processing that recognizes that an entire dataset may not be sensitive, and hence, non-sensitivity of data can be exploited to overcome some of the limitations of existing encryption-based approaches. In particular, data and computation can be partitioned into sensitive or non-sensitive datasets - sensitive data can either be encrypted prior to outsourcing or stored/processed locally on trusted servers. The non-sensitive dataset, on the other hand, can be outsourced and processed in the cleartext. While partitioned computing can bring new efficiencies since it does not incur (expensive) encrypted data processing costs on non-sensitive data, it can lead to information leakage. We study partitioned computing in two contexts - first, in the context of the hybrid cloud where local resources are integrated with public cloud resources to form an effective and secure storage and computational platform for enterprise data. In the hybrid cloud, sensitive data is stored on the private cloud to prevent leakage and a computation is partitioned between private and public clouds. Care must be taken that the public cloud cannot infer any information about sensitive data from inter-cloud data access during query processing. We then consider partitioned computing in a public cloud only setting, where sensitive data is encrypted before outsourcing. We formally define a partitioned security criterion that any approach to partitioned computing on public clouds must ensure in order to not introduce any new vulnerabilities to the existing secure solution.

> Despite the considerable success of convolutional neural networks in a broad array of domains, recent research has shown these to be vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations, commonly known as adversarial examples. Moreover, such examples have shown to be remarkably portable, or transferable, from one model to another, enabling highly successful black-box attacks. We explore this issue of transferability and robustness from two dimensions: first, considering the impact of conventional $l_p$ regularization as well as replacing the top layer with a linear support vector machine (SVM), and second, the value of combining regularized models into an ensemble. We show that models trained with different regularizers present barriers to transferability, as does partial information about the models comprising the ensemble.

> Recent discovery of security attacks in advanced processors, known as Spectre and Meltdown, has resulted in high public alertness about security of hardware. The root cause of these attacks is information leakage across "covert channels" that reveal secret data without any explicit information flow between the secret and the attacker. Many sources believe that such covert channels are intrinsic to highly advanced processor architectures based on speculation and out-of-order execution, suggesting that such security risks can be avoided by staying away from high-end processors. This paper, however, shows that the problem is of wider scope: we present new classes of covert channel attacks which are possible in average-complexity processors with in-order pipelining, as they are mainstream in applications ranging from Internet-of-Things to Autonomous Systems.   We present a new approach as a foundation for remedy against covert channels: while all previous attacks were found by clever thinking of human attackers, this paper presents an automated and exhaustive method called "Unique Program Execution Checking" which detects and locates vulnerabilities to covert channels systematically, including those to covert channels unknown so far.

> Machine learning systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained mainstream adoption in many applications. Recently, however, DNNs are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial example attacks with slight perturbations on the inputs. Existing defense mechanisms against such attacks try to improve the overall robustness of the system, but they do not differentiate different targeted attacks even though the corresponding impacts may vary significantly. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel configurable defense mechanism in this work, wherein we are able to flexibly tune the robustness of the system against different targeted attacks to satisfy application requirements. This is achieved by refining the DNN loss function with an attack sensitive matrix to represent the impacts of different targeted attacks. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution.

> As smart bands make life more convenient and provide a positive lifestyle, many people are now using them. Since smart bands deal with private information, security design and implementation for smart band system become necessary. To make a trustworthy smart band, we must derive the security requirements of the system first, and then design the system satisfying the security requirements. In this paper, we apply threat modeling techniques such as Data Flow Diagram, STRIDE, and Attack Tree to the smart band system to identify threats and derive security requirements accordingly. Through threat modeling, we found the vulnerabilities of the smart band system and successfully exploited smart bands with them. To defend against these threats, we propose security measures and verify that they are secure by using Scyther which is a tool for automatic verification of security protocol.

> Adversarial examples are considered a serious issue for safety critical applications of AI, such as finance, autonomous vehicle control and medicinal applications. Though significant work has resulted in increased robustness of systems to these attacks, systems are still vulnerable to well-crafted attacks. To address this problem, several adversarial attack detection methods have been proposed. However, a system can still be vulnerable to adversarial samples that are designed to specifically evade these detection methods. One recent detection scheme that has shown good performance is based on uncertainty estimates derived from Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles. Prior Networks, a new method of estimating predictive uncertainty, has been shown to outperform Monte-Carlo dropout on a range of tasks. One of the advantages of this approach is that the behaviour of a Prior Network can be explicitly tuned to, for example, predict high uncertainty in regions where there are no training data samples. In this work, Prior Networks are applied to adversarial attack detection using measures of uncertainty in a similar fashion to Monte-Carlo Dropout. Detection based on measures of uncertainty derived from DNNs and Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles are used as a baseline. Prior Networks are shown to significantly out-perform these baseline approaches over a range of adversarial attacks in both detection of whitebox and blackbox configurations. Even when the adversarial attacks are constructed with full knowledge of the detection mechanism, it is shown to be highly challenging to successfully generate an adversarial sample.

Moreover, the security of blockchain data directly affects the security of various applications of blockchain. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive classification and summary of the security of blockchain data. First, we present classification of blockchain data attacks. Subsequently, we present the attacks and defenses of blockchain data in terms of privacy, availability, integrity and controllability. Data privacy attacks present data leakage or data obtained by attackers through analysis. Data availability attacks present abnormal or incorrect access to blockchain data. Data integrity attacks present blockchain data being tampered. Data controllability attacks present blockchain data accidentally manipulated by smart contract vulnerability. Finally, we present several important open research directions to identify follow-up studies in this area.

> Machine Learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that rely on perturbing the input data. This work proposes a novel strategy using Autoencoder Deep Neural Networks to defend a machine learning model against two gradient-based attacks: The Fast Gradient Sign attack and Fast Gradient attack. First we use an autoencoder to denoise the test data, which is trained with both clean and corrupted data. Then, we reduce the dimension of the denoised data using the hidden layer representation of another autoencoder. We perform this experiment for multiple values of the bound of adversarial perturbations, and consider different numbers of reduced dimensions. When the test data is preprocessed using this cascaded pipeline, the tested deep neural network classifier yields a much higher accuracy, thus mitigating the effect of the adversarial perturbation.

> One of the main drawbacks of deep neural networks, like many other classifiers, is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. An important reason for their vulnerability is assigning high confidence to regions with few or even no feature points. By feature points, we mean a nonlinear transformation of the input space extracting a meaningful representation of the input data. On the other hand, deep-RBF networks assign high confidence only to the regions containing enough feature points, but they have been discounted due to the widely-held belief that they have the vanishing gradient problem. In this paper, we revisit the deep-RBF networks by first giving a general formulation for them, and then proposing a family of cost functions thereof inspired by metric learning. In the proposed deep-RBF learning algorithm, the vanishing gradient problem does not occur. We make these networks robust to adversarial attack by adding the reject option to their output layer. Through several experiments on the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed method not only achieves significant classification accuracy but is also very resistant to various adversarial attacks.

> Distributed collaborative learning (DCL) paradigms enable building joint machine learning models from distrusting multi-party participants. Data confidentiality is guaranteed by retaining private training data on each participant's local infrastructure. However, this approach to achieving data confidentiality makes today's DCL designs fundamentally vulnerable to data poisoning and backdoor attacks. It also limits DCL's model accountability, which is key to backtracking the responsible "bad" training data instances/contributors. In this paper, we introduce CALTRAIN, a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based centralized multi-party collaborative learning system that simultaneously achieves data confidentiality and model accountability. CALTRAIN enforces isolated computation on centrally aggregated training data to guarantee data confidentiality. To support building accountable learning models, we securely maintain the links between training instances and their corresponding contributors. Our evaluation shows that the models generated from CALTRAIN can achieve the same prediction accuracy when compared to the models trained in non-protected environments. We also demonstrate that when malicious training participants tend to implant backdoors during model training, CALTRAIN can accurately and precisely discover the poisoned and mislabeled training data that lead to the runtime mispredictions.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Prior defenses attempted to make deep networks more robust by either changing the network architecture or augmenting the training set with adversarial examples, but both have inherent limitations. Motivated by recent research that shows outliers in the training set have a high negative influence on the trained model, we studied the relationship between model robustness and the quality of the training set. We first show that outliers give the model better generalization ability but weaker robustness. Next, we propose an adversarial example detection framework, in which we design two methods for removing outliers from training set to obtain the sanitized model and then detect adversarial example by calculating the difference of outputs between the original and the sanitized model. We evaluated the framework on both MNIST and SVHN. Based on the difference measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence, we could detect adversarial examples with accuracy between 94.67% to 99.89%.

> The great success of convolutional neural networks has caused a massive spread of the use of such models in a large variety of Computer Vision applications. However, these models are vulnerable to certain inputs, the adversarial examples, which although are not easily perceived by humans, they can lead a neural network to produce faulty results. This paper focuses on the detection of adversarial examples, which are created for convolutional neural networks that perform image classification. We propose three methods for detecting possible adversarial examples and after we analyze and compare their performance, we combine their best aspects to develop an even more robust approach. The first proposed method is based on the regularization of the feature vector that the neural network produces as output. The second method detects adversarial examples by using histograms, which are created from the outputs of the hidden layers of the neural network. These histograms create a feature vector which is used as the input of an SVM classifier, which classifies the original input either as an adversarial or as a real input. Finally, for the third method we introduce the concept of the residual image, which contains information about the parts of the input pattern that are ignored by the neural network. This method aims at the detection of possible adversarial examples, by using the residual image and reinforcing the parts of the input pattern that are ignored by the neural network. Each one of these methods has some novelties and by combining them we can further improve the detection results. For the proposed methods and their combination, we present the results of detecting adversarial examples on the MNIST dataset. The combination of the proposed methods offers some improvements over similar state of the art approaches.

> We consider downlink channel training of a frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system when a multi-antenna jammer is present in the network. The jammer intends to degrade mean square error (MSE) of the downlink channel training by designing an attack based on second-order statistics of its channel. The channels are assumed to be spatially correlated. First, a closed-form expression for the channel estimation MSE is derived and then the jammer determines the conditions under which the MSE is maximized. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed jamming can severely increase the estimation MSE even if the optimal training signals with a large number of pilot symbols are used by the legitimate system.

> We consider the problem in precision health of grouping people into subpopulations based on their degree of vulnerability to a risk factor. These subpopulations cannot be discovered with traditional clustering techniques because their quality is evaluated with a supervised metric: the ease of modeling a response variable over observations within them. Instead, we apply the supervised cadre model (SCM), which does use this metric. We extend the SCM formalism so that it may be applied to multivariate regression and binary classification problems. We also develop a way to use conditional entropy to assess the confidence in the process by which a subject is assigned their cadre. Using the SCM, we generalize the environment-wide association study (EWAS) workflow to be able to model heterogeneity in population risk. In our EWAS, we consider more than two hundred environmental exposure factors and find their association with diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and hypertension. This requires adapting the SCM to be applicable to data generated by a complex survey design. After correcting for false positives, we found 25 exposure variables that had a significant association with at least one of our response variables. Eight of these were significant for a discovered subpopulation but not for the overall population. Some of these associations have been identified by previous researchers, while others appear to be novel. We examine several discovered subpopulations in detail, and we find that they are interpretable and that they suggest further research questions.

> The interconnection of resource-constrained and globally accessible things with untrusted and unreliable Internet make them vulnerable to attacks including data forging, false data injection, and packet drop that affects applications with critical decision-making processes. For data trustworthiness, reliance on provenance is considered to be an effective mechanism that tracks both data acquisition and data transmission. However, provenance management for sensor networks introduces several challenges, such as low energy, bandwidth consumption, and efficient storage. This paper attempts to identify packet drop (either maliciously or due to network disruptions) and detect faulty or misbehaving nodes in the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) by following a bi-fold provenance-enabled packed path tracing (PPPT) approach. Firstly, a system-level ordered-provenance information encapsulates the data generating nodes and the forwarding nodes in the data packet. Secondly, to closely monitor the dropped packets, a node-level provenance in the form of the packet sequence number is enclosed as a routing entry in the routing table of each participating node. Lossless in nature, both approaches conserve the provenance size satisfying processing and storage requirements of IoT devices. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed scheme with respect to provenance size, provenance generation time, and energy consumption.

> Android Inter-Component Communication (ICC) is complex, largely unconstrained, and hard for developers to understand. As a consequence, ICC is a common source of security vulnerability in Android apps. To promote secure programming practices, we have reviewed related research, and identified avoidable ICC vulnerabilities in Android-run devices and the security code smells that indicate their presence. We explain the vulnerabilities and their corresponding smells, and we discuss how they can be eliminated or mitigated during development. We present a lightweight static analysis tool on top of Android Lint that analyzes the code under development and provides just-in-time feedback within the IDE about the presence of such smells in the code. Moreover, with the help of this tool we study the prevalence of security code smells in more than 700 open-source apps, and manually inspect around 15% of the apps to assess the extent to which identifying such smells uncovers ICC security vulnerabilities.

> Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer overlay network to broadcast transactions and blocks. From the viewpoint of network measurement, we would like to observe this topology so we can characterize its performance, fairness and robustness. However, this is difficult because Bitcoin is deliberately designed to hide its topology from onlookers. Knowledge of the topology is not in itself a vulnerability, although it could conceivably help an attacker performing targeted eclipse attacks or to deanonymize transaction senders.   In this paper we present TxProbe, a novel technique for reconstructing the Bitcoin network topology. TxProbe makes use of peculiarities in how Bitcoin processes out of order, or "orphaned" transactions. We conducted experiments on Bitcoin testnet that suggest our technique reconstructs topology with precision and recall surpassing 90%. We also used TxProbe to take a snapshot of the Bitcoin testnet in just a few hours. TxProbe may be useful for future measurement campaigns of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency networks.

> Susceptibility of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks poses a major theoretical and practical challenge. All efforts to harden classifiers against such attacks have seen limited success. Two distinct categories of samples to which deep networks are vulnerable, "adversarial samples" and "fooling samples", have been tackled separately so far due to the difficulty posed when considered together. In this work, we show how one can address them both under one unified framework. We tie a discriminative model with a generative model, rendering the adversarial objective to entail a conflict. Our model has the form of a variational autoencoder, with a Gaussian mixture prior on the latent vector. Each mixture component of the prior distribution corresponds to one of the classes in the data. This enables us to perform selective classification, leading to the rejection of adversarial samples instead of misclassification. Our method inherently provides a way of learning a selective classifier in a semi-supervised scenario as well, which can resist adversarial attacks. We also show how one can reclassify the rejected adversarial samples.

> Exploitation of heap vulnerabilities has been on the rise, leading to many devastating attacks. Conventional heap patch generation is a lengthy procedure, requiring intensive manual efforts. Worse, fresh patches tend to harm system dependability, hence deterring users from deploying them. We propose a heap patching system that simultaneously has the following prominent advantages: (1) generating patches without manual efforts; (2) installing patches without altering the code (so called code-less patching); (3) handling various heap vulnerability types; (4) imposing a very low overhead; and (5) no dependency on specific heap allocators. As a separate contribution, we propose targeted calling context encoding, which is a suite of algorithms for optimizing calling context encoding, an important technique with applications in many areas. The system properly combines heavyweight offline attack analysis with lightweight online defense generation, and provides a new countermeasure against heap attacks. The evaluation shows that the system is effective and efficient.

> Privacy problems are lethal and getting more attention than any other issue with the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT). Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids, smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However, when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art PPDA techniques in this paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the sensor node. We have studied the most recent techniques and provide in-depth analysis of the minute steps involved in these techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most recent and comprehensive study of PPDA techniques.

> Cybersecurity training should be adaptable to evolving the cyber threat landscape, cost effective and integrated well with other enterprise management components. Unfortunately, very few cybersecurity training platforms can satisfy such requirements. This paper proposes a new and novel model for conducting cybersecurity training with three main objectives: (i) training should be initiated by emerging relevant threats and delivered first to the most vulnerable members (ii) the process has to be agile (iii) training results must be able to provide actionable intelligence. For the first time, this paper establishes a type system (ontology and associated relationships) that links the domain of cybersecurity awareness training with that of cyber threat intelligence. Powered by IBM Watson Knowledge Studio platform, the proposed method was found to be practical and scalable. Main contributions such as exports of the type system, the manually annotated corpus of 100 threat reports and 127 cybersecurity assessment results, the dictionaries for pre-annotation, etc were made publicly available.

> Owing to recorded incidents of Information technology inclined organisations failing to respond effectively to threat incidents, this project outlines the benefits of conducting a comprehensive risk assessment which would aid proficiency in responding to potential threats. The ultimate goal is primarily to identify, quantify and control the key threats that are detrimental to achieving business objectives. This project carries out a detailed risk assessment for a case study organisation. It includes a comprehensive literature review analysing several professional views on pressing issues in Information security. In the risk register, five prominent assets were identified in respect to their owners. The work is followed by a qualitative analysis methodology to determine the magnitude of the potential threats and vulnerabilities. Collating these parameters enabled the valuation of individual risk per asset, per threat and vulnerability. Evaluating a risk appetite aided in prioritising and determining acceptable risks. From the analysis, it was deduced that human being posed the greatest Information security risk through intentional/ unintentional human error. In conclusion, effective control techniques based on defence in-depth were devised to mitigate the impact of the identified risks from risk register.

> Generation-based fuzzing is a software testing approach which is able to discover different types of bugs and vulnerabilities in software. It is, however, known to be very time consuming to design and fine tune classical fuzzers to achieve acceptable coverage, even for small-scale software systems. To address this issue, we investigate a machine learning-based approach to fuzz testing in which we outline a family of test-case generators based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and train those on readily available datasets with a minimum of human fine tuning. The proposed generators do, in contrast to previous work, not rely on heuristic sampling strategies but principled sampling from the predictive distributions. We provide a detailed analysis to demonstrate the characteristics and efficacy of the proposed generators in a challenging web browser testing scenario. The empirical results show that the RNN-based generators are able to provide better coverage than a mutation based method and are able to discover paths not discovered by a classical fuzzer. Our results supplement findings in other domains suggesting that generation based fuzzing with RNNs is a viable route to better software quality conditioned on the use of a suitable model selection/analysis procedure.

> Deep Learning-based Text Understanding (DLTU) is the backbone technique behind various applications, including question answering, machine translation, and text classification. Despite its tremendous popularity, the security vulnerabilities of DLTU are still largely unknown, which is highly concerning given its increasing use in security-sensitive applications such as sentiment analysis and toxic content detection. In this paper, we show that DLTU is inherently vulnerable to adversarial text attacks, in which maliciously crafted texts trigger target DLTU systems and services to misbehave. Specifically, we present TextBugger, a general attack framework for generating adversarial texts. In contrast to prior works, TextBugger differs in significant ways: (i) effective -- it outperforms state-of-the-art attacks in terms of attack success rate; (ii) evasive -- it preserves the utility of benign text, with 94.9\% of the adversarial text correctly recognized by human readers; and (iii) efficient -- it generates adversarial text with computational complexity sub-linear to the text length. We empirically evaluate TextBugger on a set of real-world DLTU systems and services used for sentiment analysis and toxic content detection, demonstrating its effectiveness, evasiveness, and efficiency. For instance, TextBugger achieves 100\% success rate on the IMDB dataset based on Amazon AWS Comprehend within 4.61 seconds and preserves 97\% semantic similarity. We further discuss possible defense mechanisms to mitigate such attack and the adversary's potential countermeasures, which leads to promising directions for further research.

> Software ecosystems are collections of projects that are developed and evolve together in the same environment. Existing literature investigates software ecosystems as isolated entities whose boundaries do not overlap and assumes they are self-contained. However, a number of software projects are distributed in more than one ecosystem. As different aspects, e.g., success, security vulnerabilities, bugs, etc., of such cross-ecosystem packages can affect multiple ecosystems, we investigate the presence and characteristics of these cross-ecosystem packages in 12 large software distributions. We found a small number of packages distributed in multiple packaging ecosystems and that such packages are usually distributed in two ecosystems. These packages tend to better support with new releases certain ecosystems, while their evolution can impact a multitude of packages in other ecosystems. Finally, such packages appear to be popular with large developer communities.

> In the world today computer networks have a very important position and most of the urban and national infrastructure as well as organizations are managed by computer networks, therefore, the security of these systems against the planned attacks is of great importance. Therefore, researchers have been trying to find these vulnerabilities so that after identifying ways to penetrate the system, they will provide system protection through preventive or countermeasures. SVM is one of the major algorithms for intrusion detection. In this research, we studied a variety of malware and methods of intrusion detection, provide an efficient method for detecting attacks and utilizing dimension reduction.Thus, we will be able to detect attacks by carefully combining these two algorithms and pre-processes that are performed before the two on the input data. The main question raised is how we can identify attacks on computer networks with the above-mentioned method. In anomalies diagnostic method, by identifying behavior as a normal behavior for the user, the host, or the whole system, any deviation from this behavior is considered as an abnormal behavior, which can be a potential occurrence of an attack. The network intrusion detection system is used by anomaly detection method that uses the SVM algorithm for classification and SVD to reduce the size. Steps of the proposed method include pre-processing of the data set, feature selection, support vector machine, and evaluation.The NSL-KDD data set has been used to teach and test the proposed model. In this study, we inferred the intrusion detection using the SVM algorithm for classification and SVD for diminishing dimensions with no classification algorithm.Also the KNN algorithm has been compared in situations with and without diminishing dimensions,the results have shown that the proposed method has a better performance than comparable methods.

> Machine learning models are vulnerable to simple model stealing attacks if the adversary can obtain output labels for chosen inputs. To protect against these attacks, it has been proposed to limit the information provided to the adversary by omitting probability scores, significantly impacting the utility of the provided service. In this work, we illustrate how a service provider can still provide useful, albeit misleading, class probability information, while significantly limiting the success of the attack. Our defense forces the adversary to discard the class probabilities, requiring significantly more queries before they can train a model with comparable performance. We evaluate several attack strategies, model architectures, and hyperparameters under varying adversarial models, and evaluate the efficacy of our defense against the strongest adversary. Finally, we quantify the amount of noise injected into the class probabilities to mesure the loss in utility, e.g., adding 1.26 nats per query on CIFAR-10 and 3.27 on MNIST. Our evaluation shows our defense can degrade the accuracy of the stolen model at least 20%, or require up to 64 times more queries while keeping the accuracy of the protected model almost intact.

> Recently, a number of existing blockchain systems have witnessed major bugs and vulnerabilities within smart contracts. Although the literature features a number of proposals for securing smart contracts, these proposals mostly focus on proving the correctness or absence of a certain type of vulnerability within a contract, but cannot protect deployed (legacy) contracts from being exploited. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of re-entrancy exploits and propose a novel smart contract security technology, dubbed Sereum (Secure Ethereum), which protects existing, deployed contracts against re-entrancy attacks in a backwards compatible way based on run-time monitoring and validation. Sereum does neither require any modification nor any semantic knowledge of existing contracts. By means of implementation and evaluation using the Ethereum blockchain, we show that Sereum covers the actual execution flow of a smart contract to accurately detect and prevent attacks with a false positive rate as small as 0.06% and with negligible run-time overhead. As a by-product, we develop three advanced re-entrancy attacks to demonstrate the limitations of existing offline vulnerability analysis tools.

> Deep Neural Networks are quite vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Current state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods typically require very time consuming hyper-parameter tuning, or require many iterations to solve an optimization based adversarial attack. To address this problem, we present a new family of trust region based adversarial attacks, with the goal of computing adversarial perturbations efficiently. We propose several attacks based on variants of the trust region optimization method. We test the proposed methods on Cifar-10 and ImageNet datasets using several different models including AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and DenseNet-121 models. Our methods achieve comparable results with the Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack, but with significant speed up of up to $37\times$, for the VGG-16 model on a Titan Xp GPU. For the case of ResNet-50 on ImageNet, we can bring down its classification accuracy to less than 0.1\% with at most $1.5\%$ relative $L_\infty$ (or $L_2$) perturbation requiring only $1.02$ seconds as compared to $27.04$ seconds for the CW attack. We have open sourced our method which can be accessed at [1].

> Binary code analysis allows analyzing binary code without having access to the corresponding source code. A binary, after disassembly, is expressed in an assembly language. This inspires us to approach binary analysis by leveraging ideas and techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), a rich area focused on processing text of various natural languages. We notice that binary code analysis and NLP share a lot of analogical topics, such as semantics extraction, summarization, and classification. This work utilizes these ideas to address two important code similarity comparison problems. (I) Given a pair of basic blocks for different instruction set architectures (ISAs), determining whether their semantics is similar or not; and (II) given a piece of code of interest, determining if it is contained in another piece of assembly code for a different ISA. The solutions to these two problems have many applications, such as cross-architecture vulnerability discovery and code plagiarism detection. We implement a prototype system INNEREYE and perform a comprehensive evaluation. A comparison between our approach and existing approaches to Problem I shows that our system outperforms them in terms of accuracy, efficiency and scalability. And the case studies utilizing the system demonstrate that our solution to Problem II is effective. Moreover, this research showcases how to apply ideas and techniques from NLP to large-scale binary code analysis.

> Selfish mining is a well known vulnerability in blockchains exploited by miners to steal block rewards. In this paper, we explore a new form of selfish mining attack that guarantees high rewards with low cost. We show the feasibility of this attack facilitated by recent developments in blockchain technology opening new attack avenues. By outlining the limitations of existing countermeasures, we highlight a need for new defense strategies to counter this attack, and leverage key system parameters in blockchain applications to propose an algorithm that enforces fair mining. We use the expected transaction confirmation height and block publishing height to detect selfish mining behavior and develop a network-wide defense mechanism to disincentivize selfish miners. Our design involves a simple modifications to transactions' data structure in order to obtain a "truth state" used to catch the selfish miners and prevent honest miners from losing block rewards.

> Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are input samples modified in order to maximize the error on the system. We introduce Spartan Networks, resistant deep neural networks that do not require input preprocessing nor adversarial training. These networks have an adversarial layer designed to discard some information of the network, thus forcing the system to focus on relevant input. This is done using a new activation function to discard data. The added layer trains the neural network to filter-out usually-irrelevant parts of its input. Our performance evaluation shows that Spartan Networks have a slightly lower precision but report a higher robustness under attack when compared to unprotected models. Results of this study of Adversarial AI as a new attack vector are based on tests conducted on the MNIST dataset.

> Modern vehicles contain more than a hundred Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that communicate over different in-vehicle networks, and they are often connected to the Internet, which makes them vulnerable to various cyber-attacks. Besides, data collected by the connected vehicles is directly connected to the vehicular network. Thus, big vehicular data are collected, which are valuable and generate insights into driver behavior. Previously, a probabilistic modeling and simulation language named vehicleLang is presented to analyze the security of connected vehicles. However, the privacy issues of vehicular data have not been addressed. To fill in the gap, this work present a privacy specification for vehicles based on vehicleLang, which uses the Meta Attack Language (MAL) to assess the security of connected vehicles in a formal way, with a special focus on the privacy aspect. To evaluate this work, test cases are also presented.

> Smartphone apps usually have access to sensitive user data such as contacts, geo-location, and account credentials and they might share such data to external entities through the Internet or with other apps. Confidentiality of user data could be breached if there are anomalies in the way sensitive data is handled by an app which is vulnerable or malicious. Existing approaches that detect anomalous sensitive data flows have limitations in terms of accuracy because the definition of anomalous flows may differ for different apps with different functionalities; it is normal for "Health" apps to share heart rate information through the Internet but is anomalous for "Travel" apps.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect anomalous sensitive data flows in Android apps, with improved accuracy. To achieve this objective, we first group trusted apps according to the topics inferred from their functional descriptions. We then learn sensitive information flows with respect to each group of trusted apps. For a given app under analysis, anomalies are identified by comparing sensitive information flows in the app against those flows learned from trusted apps grouped under the same topic. In the evaluation, information flow is learned from 11,796 trusted apps. We then checked for anomalies in 596 new (benign) apps and identified 2 previously-unknown vulnerable apps related to anomalous flows. We also analyzed 18 malware apps and found anomalies in 6 of them.

> Despite the efficacy on a variety of computer vision tasks, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their applications in security-critical systems. Recent works have shown the possibility of generating imperceptibly perturbed image inputs (a.k.a., adversarial examples) to fool well-trained DNN classifiers into making arbitrary predictions. To address this problem, we propose a training recipe named "deep defense". Our core idea is to integrate an adversarial perturbation-based regularizer into the classification objective, such that the obtained models learn to resist potential attacks, directly and precisely. The whole optimization problem is solved just like training a recursive network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms training with adversarial/Parseval regularizations by large margins on various datasets (including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) and different DNN architectures. Code and models for reproducing our results are available at https://github.com/ZiangYan/deepdefense.pytorch

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently led to significant improvements in many fields. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are samples with imperceptible perturbations while dramatically misleading the DNNs. Moreover, adversarial examples can be used to perform an attack on various kinds of DNN based systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Many defense methods have been proposed, such as obfuscating gradients of the networks or detecting adversarial examples. However it is proved out that these defense methods are not effective or cannot resist secondary adversarial attacks. In this paper, we point out that steganalysis can be applied to adversarial examples detection, and propose a method to enhance steganalysis features by estimating the probability of modifications caused by adversarial attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect adversarial examples. Moreover, secondary adversarial attacks cannot be directly performed to our method because our method is not based on a neural network but based on high-dimensional artificial features and FLD (Fisher Linear Discriminant) ensemble.

> Streaming tensor factorization is a powerful tool for processing high-volume and multi-way temporal data in Internet networks, recommender systems and image/video data analysis. Existing streaming tensor factorization algorithms rely on least-squares data fitting and they do not possess a mechanism for tensor rank determination. This leaves them susceptible to outliers and vulnerable to over-fitting. This paper presents a Bayesian robust streaming tensor factorization model to identify sparse outliers, automatically determine the underlying tensor rank and accurately fit low-rank structure. We implement our model in Matlab and compare it with existing algorithms on tensor datasets generated from dynamic MRI and Internet traffic.

> Wireless communications are vulnerable against radio frequency (RF) jamming which might be caused either intentionally or unintentionally. A particular subset of wireless networks, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) which incorporate a series of safety-critical applications, may be a potential target of RF jamming with detrimental safety effects. To ensure secure communication and defend it against this type of attacks, an accurate detection scheme must be adopted. In this paper we introduce a detection scheme that is based on supervised learning. The machine-learning algorithms, KNearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forests (RF), utilize a series of features among which is the metric of the variations of relative speed (VRS) between the jammer and the receiver that is passively estimated from the combined value of the useful and the jamming signal at the receiver. To the best of our knowledge, this metric has never been utilized before in a machine-learning detection scheme in the literature. Through offline training and the proposed KNN-VRS, RF-VRS classification algorithms, we are able to efficiently detect various cases of Denial of Service Attacks (DoS) jamming attacks, differentiate them from cases of interference as well as foresee a potential danger successfully and act accordingly.
