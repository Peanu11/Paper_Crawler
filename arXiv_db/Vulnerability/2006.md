> In this paper, we present a system called Checkbochs, a machine simulator that checks rules about its guest operating system and applications at the hardware level. The properties to be checked can be implemented as `plugins' in the Checkbochs simulator. Some of the properties that were checked using Checkbochs include null-pointer checks, format-string vulnerabilities, user/kernel pointer checks, and race-conditions. On implementing these checks, we were able to uncover previously-unknown bugs in widely used Linux distributions. We also tested our tools on undergraduate coursework, and found numerous bugs.

> We present a novel approach to estimate the time delay between light curves of multiple images in a gravitationally lensed system, based on Kernel methods in the context of machine learning. We perform various experiments with artificially generated irregularly-sampled data sets to study the effect of the various levels of noise and the presence of gaps of various size in the monitoring data. We compare the performance of our method with various other popular methods of estimating the time delay and conclude, from experiments with artificial data, that our method is least vulnerable to missing data and irregular sampling, within reasonable bounds of Gaussian noise. Thereafter, we use our method to determine the time delays between the two images of quasar Q0957+561 from radio monitoring data at 4 cm and 6 cm, and conclude that if only the observations at epochs common to both wavelengths are used, the time delay gives consistent estimates, which can be combined to yield 408\pm 12 days. The full 6 cm dataset, which covers a longer monitoring period, yields a value which is 10% larger, but this can be attributed to differences in sampling and missing data.

<summary>2006-09-06 14:40:25 - ANAP: Anonymous Authentication Protocol in Mobile Ad hoc Networks</summary>

> The pervasiveness of wireless communication recently gave mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) a significant researchers' attention, due to its innate capabilities of instant communication in many time and mission critical applications. However, its natural advantages of networking in civilian and military environments make them vulnerable to security threats. Support for an anonymity in MANET is an orthogonal to security critical challenge we faced in this paper. We propose a new anonymous authentication protocol for mobile ad hoc networks enhanced with a distributed reputation system. The main its objective is to provide mechanisms concealing a real identity of communicating nodes with an ability of resist to known attacks. The distributed reputation system is incorporated for a trust management and malicious behavior detection in the network. The end-to-end anonymous authentication is conducted in three-pass handshake based on an asymmetric and symmetric key cryptography. After successfully finished authentication phase secure and multiple anonymous data channels are established. The anonymity is guarantied by randomly chosen pseudonyms owned by a user. Nodes of the network are publicly identified and are independent of users' pseudonyms. In this paper we presented an example of the protocol implementation.

<summary>2006-10-13 13:01:12 - Share and Disperse: How to Resist Against Aggregator Compromises in Sensor Networks</summary>

- *Thomas Claveirole, Marcelo Dias de Amorim, Michel Abdalla, Yannis Viniotis*

> A common approach to overcome the limited nature of sensor networks is to aggregate data at intermediate nodes. A challenging issue in this context is to guarantee end-to-end security mainly because sensor networks are extremely vulnerable to node compromises. In order to secure data aggregation, in this paper we propose three schemes that rely on multipath routing. The first one guarantees data confidentiality through secret sharing, while the second and third ones provide data availability through information dispersal. Based on qualitative analysis and implementation, we show that, by applying these schemes, a sensor network can achieve data confidentiality, authenticity, and protection against denial of service attacks even in the presence of multiple compromised nodes.
