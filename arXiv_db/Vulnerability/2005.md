> During the last years, large-scale simulations of realistic physical environments which support the interaction of multiple participants over the Internet have become increasingly available and economically significant, most notably in the computer gaming industry. Such systems, commonly called networked virtual environments (NVEs), are usually based on a client-server architecture where for performance reasons and bandwidth restrictions, the simulation is partially deferred to the clients. This inevitable architectural choice renders the simulation vulnerable to attacks against the semantic integrity of the simulation: malicious clients may attempt to compromise the physical and logical laws governing the simulation, or to alter the causality of events a posteriori. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of semantic integrity in NVEs from a security point of view. We argue that naive policies to enforce semantic integrity involve intolerable network load, and are therefore not practically feasible. We present a new semantic integrity protocol based on cryptographic primitives which enables the server system to audit the local computations of the clients on demand. Our approach facilitates low network and CPU load, incurs reasonable engineering overhead, and maximally decouples the auditing process from the soft real time constraints of the simulation.

<summary>2005-04-14 20:15:24 - Knowledge Representation Issues in Semantic Graphs for Relationship Detection</summary>

> An important task for Homeland Security is the prediction of threat vulnerabilities, such as through the detection of relationships between seemingly disjoint entities. A structure used for this task is a "semantic graph", also known as a "relational data graph" or an "attributed relational graph". These graphs encode relationships as "typed" links between a pair of "typed" nodes. Indeed, semantic graphs are very similar to semantic networks used in AI. The node and link types are related through an ontology graph (also known as a schema). Furthermore, each node has a set of attributes associated with it (e.g., "age" may be an attribute of a node of type "person"). Unfortunately, the selection of types and attributes for both nodes and links depends on human expertise and is somewhat subjective and even arbitrary. This subjectiveness introduces biases into any algorithm that operates on semantic graphs. Here, we raise some knowledge representation issues for semantic graphs and provide some possible solutions using recently developed ideas in the field of complex networks. In particular, we use the concept of transitivity to evaluate the relevance of individual links in the semantic graph for detecting relationships. We also propose new statistical measures for semantic graphs and illustrate these semantic measures on graphs constructed from movies and terrorism data.

> In 2002, Chien&#8211;Jan&#8211;Tseng introduced an efficient remote user authentication scheme using smart cards. Further, in 2004, W. C. Ku and S. M. Chen proposed an efficient remote user authentication scheme using smart cards to solve the security problems of Chien et al.&#8217;s scheme. Recently, Hsu and Yoon et al. pointed out the security weakness of the Ku and Chen&#8217;s scheme Furthermore, Yoon et al. modified the password change phase of Ku and Chen&#8217;s scheme and they also proposed a new efficient remote user authentication scheme using smart cards. This paper analyzes that the modified scheme of Yoon et al. still vulnerable to parallel session attack.

<summary>2005-05-11 09:39:22 - Disaster Management in Scale-Free Networks: Recovery from and Protection Against Intentional Attacks</summary>

- *Behnam A. Rezaei, Nima Sarshar, P. Oscar Boykin, Vwani P. Roychowdhury*

- `0504185v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0504185v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0504185v3)

> Susceptibility of scale free Power Law (PL) networks to attacks has been traditionally studied in the context of what may be termed as {\em instantaneous attacks}, where a randomly selected set of nodes and edges are deleted while the network is kept {\em static}. In this paper, we shift the focus to the study of {\em progressive} and instantaneous attacks on {\em reactive} grown and random PL networks, which can respond to attacks and take remedial steps. In the process, we present several techniques that managed networks can adopt to minimize the damages during attacks, and also to efficiently recover from the aftermath of successful attacks. For example, we present (i) compensatory dynamics that minimize the damages inflicted by targeted progressive attacks, such as linear-preferential deletions of nodes in grown PL networks; the resulting dynamic naturally leads to the emergence of networks with PL degree distributions with exponential cutoffs; (ii) distributed healing algorithms that can scale the maximum degree of nodes in a PL network using only local decisions, and (iii) efficient means of creating giant connected components in a PL network that has been fragmented by attacks on a large number of high-degree nodes. Such targeted attacks are considered to be a major vulnerability of PL networks; however, our results show that the introduction of only a small number of random edges, through a {\em reverse percolation} process, can restore connectivity, which in turn allows restoration of other topological properties of the original network. Thus, the scale-free nature of the networks can itself be effectively utilized for protection and recovery purposes.

<summary>2005-06-30 03:20:55 - A protected password change protocol</summary>

- *Ren-Chiun Wang, Chou-Chen Yang, Kun-Ru Mo*

> Some protected password change protocols were proposed. However, the previous protocols were easily vulnerable to several attacks such as denial of service, password guessing, stolen-verifier and impersonation atacks etc. Recently, Chang et al. proposed a simple authenticated key agreement and protected password change protocol for enhancing the security and efficiency. In this paper, authors shall show that password guessing, denial of service and known-key attacks can work in their password change protocol. At the same time, authors shall propose a new password change protocol to withstand all the threats of security.

<summary>2005-09-26 21:20:00 - On Vulnerabilities, Constraints and Assumptions</summary>

- *Anil Bazaz, James D. Arthur*

- `0509076v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0509076v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0509076v1)

> This report presents a taxonomy of vulnerabilities created as a part of an effort to develop a framework for deriving verification and validation strategies to assess software security. This taxonomy is grounded in a theoretical model of computing, which establishes the relationship between vulnerabilities, software applications and the computer system resources. This relationship illustrates that a software application is exploited by violating constraints imposed by computer system resources and assumptions made about their usage. In other words, a vulnerability exists in the software application if it allows violation of these constraints and assumptions. The taxonomy classifies these constraints and assumptions. The model also serves as a basis for the classification scheme the taxonomy uses, in which the computer system resources such as, memory, input/output, and cryptographic resources serve as categories and subcategories. Vulnerabilities, which are expressed in the form of constraints and assumptions, are classified according to these categories and subcategories. This taxonomy is both novel and distinctively different from other taxonomies found in the literature.

<summary>2005-12-22 22:02:34 - On The Effectiveness of Kolmogorov Complexity Estimation to Discriminate Semantic Types</summary>

- *Stephen F. Bush, Todd Hughes*

> We present progress on the experimental validation of a fundamental and universally applicable vulnerability analysis framework that is capable of identifying new types of vulnerabilities before attackers innovate attacks. This new framework proactively identifies system components that are vulnerable based upon their Kolmogorov Complexity estimates and it facilitates prediction of previously unknown vulnerabilities that are likely to be exploited by future attack methods. A tool that utilizes a growing library of complexity estimators is presented. This work is an incremental step towards validation of the concept of complexity-based vulnerability analysis. In particular, results indicate that data types (semantic types) can be identified by estimates of their complexity. Thus, a map of complexity can identify suspicious types, such as executable data embedded within passive data types, without resorting to predefined headers, signatures, or other limiting a priori information.
