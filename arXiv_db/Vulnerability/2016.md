> This report presents the results of a workshop conducted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Information Systems Technology (IST) Panel in Istanbul, Turkey, in June 2015 to explore science and technology for characterizing the impact of cyber-attacks on missions. Military mission success is highly dependent on the communications and information systems (CISs) that support the mission and their use in the cyber battlespace. The inexorably growing dependency on computational information processing for weapons, intelligence, communication, and logistics systems continues to increase the vulnerability of missions to various cyber threats. Attacks on CISs or other cyber incidents degrade or disrupt the usage of CISs, and the resulting mission capability, performance, and completion. These incidents are expected to increase in frequency and sophistication. The workshop participants concluded that the key to solving the mission impact assessment problem was in adopting and developing a new model-driven paradigm that creates and validates mechanisms of modeling the mission organization, the mission(s), and the cyber-vulnerable systems that support the mission(s). Such models then simulate or portray the impacts of the cyber-attacks. In addition, such model-based analysis could explore multiple alternative mitigation and work-around strategies - an essential part of coping with mission impact - and select the optimal course of mitigating actions. Only such a paradigm can be expected to provide meaningful, actionable information about mission impacts that have not been seen before or do not match prior experiences and patterns. The papers presented at this workshop are available in an accompanying volume, Proceedings of the NATO Workshop IST-128, Assessing Mission Impact of Cyber Attacks.

- *Ali Gholami, Erwin Laure*

- `1601.01500v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01500v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.01500v1)

> Privacy-preservation for sensitive data has become a challenging issue in cloud computing. Threat modeling as a part of requirements engineering in secure software development provides a structured approach for identifying attacks and proposing countermeasures against the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a system . This paper describes an extension of Cloud Privacy Threat Modeling (CPTM) methodology for privacy threat modeling in relation to processing sensitive data in cloud computing environments. It describes the modeling methodology that involved applying Method Engineering to specify characteristics of a cloud privacy threat modeling methodology, different steps in the proposed methodology and corresponding products. We believe that the extended methodology facilitates the application of a privacy-preserving cloud software development approach from requirements engineering to design.

- *Vladislav Mladenov, Christian Mainka, JÃ¶rg Schwenk*

- `1508.04324v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04324v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04324v2)

> OAuth is the new de facto standard for delegating authorization in the web. An important limitation of OAuth is the fact that it was designed for authorization and not for authentication. The usage of OAuth for authentication thus leads to serious vulnerabilities as shown by Zhou et. al. in [44] and Chen et. al. in [9]. OpenID Connect was created on top of OAuth to fill this gap by providing federated identity management and user authentication. OpenID Connect was standardized in February 2014, but leading companies like Google, Microsoft, AOL and PayPal are already using it in their web applications [1], [2], [3], [30].   In this paper we describe the OpenID Connect protocol and provide the first in-depth analysis of one of the key features of OpenID Connect: the Discovery and the Dynamic Registration extensions.We present a new class of attacks on OpenID Connect that belong to the category of second-order vulnerabilities. These attacks consist of two phases: First, the injection payload is stored by the legitimate application. Later on, this payload is used in a security-critical operation. Our new class of attacks - called Malicious Endpoints attacks - exploits the OpenID Connect extensions Discovery and Dynamic Registration. These attacks break user authentication, compromise user privacy, and enable Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), client-side code injection, and Denial-of-Service (DoS). As a result, the security of the OpenID Connect protocol cannot be guaranteed when these extensions are enabled in their present form.   We contacted the authors of the OpenID Connect and OAuth specifications. They acknowledged our Malicious Endpoint attacks and recognized the need to improve the specification [29]. We are currently involved in the discussion regarding the mitigation of the existing issues and an extension to the OAuth specification.

<summary>2016-01-12 07:33:47 - Preventing Your Faults From Telling Your Secrets: Defenses Against Pigeonhole Attacks</summary>

- *Shweta Shinde, Zheng Leong Chua, Viswesh Narayanan, Prateek Saxena*

- `1506.04832v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04832v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04832v2)

> New hardware primitives such as Intel SGX secure a user-level process in presence of an untrusted or compromised OS. Such "enclaved execution" systems are vulnerable to several side-channels, one of which is the page fault channel. In this paper, we show that the page fault side-channel has sufficient channel capacity to extract bits of encryption keys from commodity implementations of cryptographic routines in OpenSSL and Libgcrypt --- leaking 27% on average and up to 100% of the secret bits in many case-studies. To mitigate this, we propose a software-only defense that masks page fault patterns by determinising the program's memory access behavior. We show that such a technique can be built into a compiler, and implement it for a subset of C which is sufficient to handle the cryptographic routines we study. This defense when implemented generically can have significant overhead of up to 4000X, but with help of developer-assisted compiler optimizations, the overhead reduces to at most 29.22% in our case studies. Finally, we discuss scope for hardware-assisted defenses, and show one solution that can reduce overheads to 6.77% with support from hardware changes.

<summary>2016-01-17 08:40:58 - Sound and Complete Runtime Security Monitor for Application Software</summary>

- *Muhammad Taimoor Khan, Dimitrios Serpanos, Howard Shrobe*

- `1601.04263v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04263v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04263v1)

> Conventional approaches for ensuring the security of application software at run-time, through monitoring, either produce (high rates of) false alarms (e.g. intrusion detection systems) or limit application performance (e.g. run-time verification). We present a runtime security monitor that detects both known and unknown cyber attacks by checking that the run-time behavior of the application is consistent with the expected behavior modeled in application specification. This is crucial because, even if the implementation is consistent with its specification, the application may still be vulnerable due to flaws in the supporting infrastructure (e.g. the language runtime system, libraries and operating system). This runtime security monitor is sound and complete, eliminating false alarms, as well as efficient, so that it does not limit runtime application performance and so that it supports real-time systems. The security monitor takes as input the application specification and the application implementation, which may be expressed in different languages. The specification language of the application software is formalized based on monadic second order logic and event calculus interpreted over algebraic data structures. This language allows us to express behavior of an application at any desired (and practical) level of abstraction as well as with high degree of modularity. The security monitor detects every attack by systematically comparing the application execution and specification behaviors at runtime, even though they operate at two different levels of abstraction. We define the denotational semantics of the specification language and prove that the monitor is sound and complete. Furthermore, the monitor is efficient because of the modular application specification at appropriate level(s) of abstraction.

<summary>2016-01-18 17:41:17 - Investigating the Performances and Vulnerabilities of Two New Protocols Based on R-RAPSE</summary>

- *Seyed Salman Sajjadi Ghaemmaghami, Afrooz Haghbin, Mahtab Mirmohseni*

- `1601.04622v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04622v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04622v1)

> Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is a pioneer technology which has depicted a new lifestyle for humanity in all around the world. Every day we observe an increase in the scope of RFID applications and no one cannot withdraw its numerous usage around him/herself. An important issue which should be considered is providing privacy and security requirements of an RFID system. Recently in 2014, Cai et al. proposed two improved RFID authentication protocols based on R-RAPS rules by the names of IHRMA and I2SRS. In this paper, we investigate the privacy of the aforementioned protocols based on Ouafi and Phan formal privacy model and show that both IHRMA and I2SRS protocols cannot provide private authentication for RFID users. Moreover, we showthat these protocols are vulnerable to impersonation, DoS and traceability attacks. Then, by considering the drawbacks of the studied protocols and implementation of messages with new structures, we present two improved efficient and secure authentication protocols to ameliorate the performance of Cai et al schemes. Our analysis illustrate that the existing weaknesses of the discussed protocols are eliminated in our proposed protocols.

<summary>2016-01-20 23:20:38 - A Survey on Security Metrics</summary>

- *Marcus Pendleton, Richard Garcia-Lebron, Shouhuai Xu*

- `1601.05792v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05792v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.05792v1)

> The importance of security metrics can hardly be overstated. Despite the attention that has been paid by the academia, government and industry in the past decades, this important problem stubbornly remains open. In this survey, we present a survey of knowledge on security metrics. The survey is centered on a novel taxonomy, which classifies security metrics into four categories: metrics for measuring the system vulnerabilities, metrics for measuring the defenses, metrics for measuring the threats, and metrics for measuring the situations. The insight underlying the taxonomy is that situations (or outcomes of cyber attack-defense interactions) are caused by certain threats (or attacks) against systems that have certain vulnerabilities (including human factors) and employ certain defenses. In addition to systematically reviewing the security metrics that have been proposed in the literature, we discuss the gaps between the state of the art and the ultimate goals.

<summary>2016-01-21 22:41:08 - Executing Arbitrary Code in the Context of the Smartcard System Service</summary>

- *Michael Roland*

> This report summarizes our findings regarding a severe weakness in implementations of the Open Mobile API deployed on several Android devices. The vulnerability allows arbitrary code coming from a specially crafted Android application package (APK) to be injected into and executed by the smartcard system service component (the middleware component of the Open Mobile API implementation). This can be exploited to gain elevated capabilities, such as privileges protected by signature- and system-level permissions assigned to this service. The affected source code seems to originate from the SEEK-for-Android open-source project and was adopted by various vendor-specific implementations of the Open Mobile API, including the one that is used on the Nexus 6 (as of Android version 5.1).

> Effectively protecting the Windows OS is a challenging task, since most implementation details are not publicly known. Windows has always been the main target of malwares that have exploited numerous bugs and vulnerabilities. Recent trusted boot and additional integrity checks have rendered the Windows OS less vulnerable to kernel-level rootkits. Nevertheless, guest Windows Virtual Machines are becoming an increasingly interesting attack target. In this work we introduce and analyze a novel Hypervisor-Based Introspection System (HyBIS) we developed for protecting Windows OSes from malware and rootkits. The HyBIS architecture is motivated and detailed, while targeted experimental results show its effectiveness. Comparison with related work highlights main HyBIS advantages such as: effective semantic introspection, support for 64-bit architectures and for latest Windows (8.x and 10), advanced malware disabling capabilities. We believe the research effort reported here will pave the way to further advances in the security of Windows OSes.

- *Stefanie Roos, Martin Beck, Thorsten Strufe*

- `1601.06119v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06119v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06119v1)

> Friend-to-friend (F2F) overlays, which restrict direct communication to mutually trusted parties, are a promising substrate for privacy-preserving communication due to their inherent membership-concealment and Sybil-resistance. Yet, existing F2F overlays suffer from a low performance, are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, or fail to provide anonymity. In particular, greedy embeddings allow highly efficient communication in arbitrary connectivity-restricted overlays but require communicating parties to reveal their identity. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving routing scheme for greedy embeddings based on anonymous return addresses rather than identifying node coordinates. We prove that the presented algorithm are highly scalalbe, with regard to the complexity of both the routing and the stabilization protocols. Furthermore, we show that the return addresses provide plausible deniability for both sender and receiver. We further enhance the routing's resilience by using multiple embeddings and propose a method for efficient content addressing. Our simulation study on real-world data indicates that our approach is highly efficient and effectively mitigates failures as well as powerful denial-of-service attacks.

> Significant portion of contemporary computer users are children, who are vulnerable to threats coming from the Internet. To protect children from such threats, in this study, we investigate how successfully typing data can be used to distinguish children from adults. For this purpose, we collect a dataset comprising keystroke data of 100 users and show that distinguishing child Internet users from adults is possible using Keystroke Dynamics with equal error rates less than 10 percent. However the error rates increase significantly when there are impostors in the system.

<summary>2016-02-03 10:49:54 - User Collusion Avoidance Scheme for Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption -- Full Version</summary>

- *Yogachandran Rahulamathavan*

- `1602.01261v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01261v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01261v1)

> Recent trend towards cloud computing paradigm, smart devices and 4G wireless technologies has enabled seamless data sharing among users. Cloud computing environment is distributed and untrusted, hence data owners have to encrypt their data to enforce data confidentiality. The data confidentiality in a distributed environment can be achieved by using attribute-based encryption technique. Decentralized attribute-based encryption technique is a variant of multiple authority based attribute-based encryption whereby any attribute authority can independently join and leave the system without collaborating with the existing attribute authorities. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme. The scheme preserves the user privacy when users interact with multiple authorities to obtain decryption keys while mitigating the well-known user collusion security vulnerability. We showed that our scheme relies on decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman standard complexity assumption in contrast to the previous nonstandard complexity assumptions such as $q-$decisional Diffie-Hellman inversion.

> This paper will discuss the Logjam attack on TLS. The Logjam attack allows, under certain conditions, to defeat the security provided by TLS. This is done by manipulating server and client into using weak and deprecated export grade crypto, and subsequently breaking the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. We explore how the attack works conceptually and how exactly TLS is vulnerable to this attack. Also, the conditions under which the attack can be mounted are discussed, and an estimate of the impact of the attack is presented. Lastly, several mitigations are presented.

<summary>2016-02-09 20:21:18 - Limiting Self-Propagating Malware Based on Connection Failure Behavior through Hyper-Compact Estimators</summary>

- *You Zhou, Yian Zhou, Shigang Chen, O. Patrick Kreidl*

- `1602.03153v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03153v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03153v1)

> Self-propagating malware (e.g., an Internet worm) exploits security loopholes in software to infect servers and then use them to scan the Internet for more vulnerable servers. While the mechanisms of worm infection and their propagation models are well understood, defense against worms remains an open problem. One branch of defense research investigates the behavioral difference between worm-infected hosts and normal hosts to set them apart. One particular observation is that a worm-infected host, which scans the Internet with randomly selected addresses, has a much higher connection-failure rate than a normal host. Rate-limit algorithms have been proposed to control the spread of worms by traffic shaping based on connection failure rate. However, these rate-limit algorithms can work properly only if it is possible to measure failure rates of individual hosts efficiently and accurately. This paper points out a serious problem in the prior method. To address this problem, we first propose a solution based on a highly efficient double-bitmap data structure, which places only a small memory footprint on the routers, while providing good measurement of connection failure rates whose accuracy can be tuned by system parameters. Furthermore, we propose another solution based on shared register array data structure, achieving better memory efficiency and much larger estimation range than our double-bitmap solution.

> We propose a traffic confirmation attack on low-latency mix networks based on computing robust real-time binary hashes of network traffic flows. Firstly, we adapt the Coskun-Memon Algorithm to construct hashes that can withstand network impairments to allow fast matching of network flows. The resulting attack has a low startup cost and achieves a true positive match rate of 80% when matching one flow out of 9000 with less than 2% false positives, showing traffic confirmation attacks can be highly accurate even when only part of the network traffic flow is seen. Secondly, we attack probabilistic padding schemes achieving a match rate of over 90% from 9000 network traffic flows, showing advanced padding techniques are still vulnerable to traffic confirmation attacks.

- `1602.04115v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04115v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04115v1)

> Conforming to W3C specifications, mobile web browsers allow JavaScript code in a web page to access motion and orientation sensor data without the user's permission. The associated risks to user security and privacy are however not considered in W3C specifications. In this work, for the first time, we show how user security can be compromised using these sensor data via browser, despite that the data rate is 3 to 5 times slower than what is available in app. We examine multiple popular browsers on Android and iOS platforms and study their policies in granting permissions to JavaScript code with respect to access to motion and orientation sensor data. Based on our observations, we identify multiple vulnerabilities, and propose TouchSignatures which implements an attack where malicious JavaScript code on an attack tab listens to such sensor data measurements. Based on these streams, TouchSignatures is able to distinguish the user's touch actions (i.e., tap, scroll, hold, and zoom) and her PINs, allowing a remote website to learn the client-side user activities. We demonstrate the practicality of this attack by collecting data from real users and reporting high success rates using our proof-of-concept implementations. We also present a set of potential solutions to address the vulnerabilities. The W3C community and major mobile browser vendors including Mozilla, Google, Apple and Opera have acknowledge our work and are implementing some of our proposed countermeasures.

- `1603.00747v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00747v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00747v1)

> As process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, DRAM chips become more vulnerable to disturbance, a phenomenon in which different DRAM cells interfere with each other's operation. For the first time in academic literature, our ISCA paper exposes the existence of disturbance errors in commodity DRAM chips that are sold and used today. We show that repeatedly reading from the same address could corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically: When a DRAM row is opened (i.e., activated) and closed (i.e., precharged) repeatedly (i.e., hammered), it can induce disturbance errors in adjacent DRAM rows. This failure mode is popularly called RowHammer. We tested 129 DRAM modules manufactured within the past six years (2008-2014) and found 110 of them to exhibit RowHammer disturbance errors, the earliest of which dates back to 2010. In particular, all modules from the past two years (2012-2013) were vulnerable, which implies that the errors are a recent phenomenon affecting more advanced generations of process technology. Importantly, disturbance errors pose an easily-exploitable security threat since they are a breach of memory protection, wherein accesses to one page (mapped to one row) modifies the data stored in another page (mapped to an adjacent row).

> Website fingerprinting enables an attacker to infer which web page a client is browsing through encrypted or anonymized network connections. We present a new website fingerprinting technique based on random decision forests and evaluate performance over standard web pages as well as Tor hidden services, on a larger scale than previous works. Our technique, k-fingerprinting, performs better than current state-of-the-art attacks even against website fingerprinting defenses, and we show that it is possible to launch a website fingerprinting attack in the face of a large amount of noisy data. We can correctly determine which of 30 monitored hidden services a client is visiting with 85% true positive rate (TPR), a false positive rate (FPR) as low as 0.02%, from a world size of 100,000 unmonitored web pages. We further show that error rates vary widely between web resources, and thus some patterns of use will be predictably more vulnerable to attack than others.

> Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Little is known about real-world Sybils in the Tor network, and we lack practical tools and methods to expose Sybil attacks. In this work, we develop sybilhunter, the first system for detecting Sybil relays based on their appearance, such as configuration; and behavior, such as uptime sequences. We used sybilhunter's diverse analysis techniques to analyze nine years of archived Tor network data, providing us with new insights into the operation of real-world attackers. Our findings include diverse Sybils, ranging from botnets, to academic research, and relays that hijack Bitcoin transactions. Our work shows that existing Sybil defenses do not apply to Tor, it delivers insights into real-world attacks, and provides practical tools to uncover and characterize Sybils, making the network safer for its users.

> Recent studies have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to a small perturbation of input called "adversarial examples". In this work, we propose a new feedforward CNN that improves robustness in the presence of adversarial noise. Our model uses stochastic additive noise added to the input image and to the CNN models. The proposed model operates in conjunction with a CNN trained with either standard or adversarial objective function. In particular, convolution, max-pooling, and ReLU layers are modified to benefit from the noise model. Our feedforward model is parameterized by only a mean and variance per pixel which simplifies computations and makes our method scalable to a deep architecture. From CIFAR-10 and ImageNet test, the proposed model outperforms other methods and the improvement is more evident for difficult classification tasks or stronger adversarial noise.

> In response to the growing HIV/AIDS and other health-related issues, UNICEF through their U-Report platform receives thousands of messages (SMS) every day to provide prevention strategies, health case advice, and counsel- ing support to vulnerable population. Due to a rapid increase in U-Report usage (up to 300% in last 3 years), plus approximately 1,000 new registrations each day, the volume of messages has thus continued to increase, which made it impossible for the team at UNICEF to process them in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a platform designed to perform automatic classification of short messages (SMS) in real-time to help UNICEF categorize and prioritize health-related messages as they arrive. We employ a hybrid approach, which combines human and machine intelligence that seeks to resolve the information overload issue by introducing processing of large-scale data at high-speed while maintaining a high classification accuracy. The system has recently been tested in conjunction with UNICEF in Zambia to classify short messages received via the U-Report platform on various health related issues. The system is designed to enable UNICEF make sense of a large volume of short messages in a timely manner. In terms of evaluation, we report design choices, challenges, and performance of the system observed during the deployment to validate its effectiveness.

- `1603.00100v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00100v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00100v1)

> The Rabin cryptosystem has been proposed protect the unique ID (UID) in radio-frequency identification tags. The Rabin cryptosystem is a type of lightweight public key system that is theoretetically quite secure; however it is vulnerable to several side-channel attacks. In this paper, a crashing modulus attack is presented as a new fault attack on modular squaring during Rabin encryption. This attack requires only one fault in the public key if its perturbed public key can be factored. Our simulation results indicate that the attack is more than 50\% successful with several faults in practical time. A complicated situation arises when reconstrucing the message, including the UID, from ciphertext, i.e., the message and the perturbed public key are not relatively prime. We present a complete and mathematically rigorous message reconstruction algorithm for such a case. Moreover, we propose an exact formula to obtain a number of candidate messages. We show that the number is not generally equal to a power of two.

> Cognitive radio technology, which is designed to enhance spectrum utilization, depends on the success of opportunistic access, where secondary users (SUs) exploit spectrum void unoccupied by primary users (PUs) for transmissions. We note that the system behaviors are very similar to the interactions among different species coexisting in an ecosystem. However, SUs of a selfish nature or of misleading information may make concurrent transmissions with PUs for additional incentives, and thus disrupt the entire ecosystem. By exploiting this vulnerability, this paper proposes a novel distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack where invasive species, i.e., malicious users (MUs), induce originally normal-behaved SUs to execute concurrent transmissions with PUs and thus collapse the cognitive radio network. We adopt stochastic geometry to model the spatial distributions of PUs, SUs, and MUs for the analysis of the mutual interference among them. The access strategy of each SU in the spectrum sharing ecosystem, which evolves with the experienced payoffs and interference, is modeled by an evolutionary game. Based on the evolutionary stable strategy concept, we could efficiently identify the fragile operating region at which normal-behaved SUs are eventually evolved to conduct concurrent transmissions and thus to cause the ruin of the network.

> We present an online voting architecture based on partitioning the election in small clusters of voters and using a new Multi-party Computation algorithm for obtaining voting results from the clusters. This new algorithm has some practical advantages over other previously known algorithms and isn't bound to any specific cryptographic concept; so it can be adapted to future cryptographic exigencies. Compared with other online voting technologies, we see that this new architecture is less vulnerable to hacker attacks and attacks from dishonest authorities, given that no sensitive information is stored in any public server and there is no need for any trustee to safeguard the legality of the election process. Even in case of an attack succeeding, the risks associated with the overall election are far lower than with any other voting system. This architecture can also be combined with any other voting system, inheriting advantages from both systems.

- *Nicolas Papernot, Patrick McDaniel, Xi Wu, Somesh Jha, Ananthram Swami*

- `1511.04508v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04508v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04508v2)

> Deep learning algorithms have been shown to perform extremely well on many classical machine learning problems. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 10^30. We also find that distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we tested.

- *Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Mathias Payer, Reza Moazzezi, Mario Frank*

- `1506.02294v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02294v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02294v2)

> Mobile devices store a diverse set of private user data and have gradually become a hub to control users' other personal Internet-of-Things devices. Access control on mobile devices is therefore highly important. The widely accepted solution is to protect access by asking for a password. However, password authentication is tedious, e.g., a user needs to input a password every time she wants to use the device. Moreover, existing biometrics such as face, fingerprint, and touch behaviors are vulnerable to forgery attacks.   We propose a new touch-based biometric authentication system that is passive and secure against forgery attacks. In our touch-based authentication, a user's touch behaviors are a function of some random "secret". The user can subconsciously know the secret while touching the device's screen. However, an attacker cannot know the secret at the time of attack, which makes it challenging to perform forgery attacks even if the attacker has already obtained the user's touch behaviors. We evaluate our touch-based authentication system by collecting data from 25 subjects. Results are promising: the random secrets do not influence user experience and, for targeted forgery attacks, our system achieves 0.18 smaller Equal Error Rates (EERs) than previous touch-based authentication.

- `1603.05462v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05462v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05462v1)

> Global Positioning System (GPS) is used ubiquitously in a wide variety of applications ranging from navigation and tracking to modern smart grids and communication networks. However, it has been demonstrated that modern GPS receivers are vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. For example, today it is possible to change the course of a ship or force a drone to land in an hostile area by simply spoofing GPS signals. Several countermeasures have been proposed in the past to detect GPS spoofing attacks. These countermeasures offer protection only against naive attackers. They are incapable of detecting strong attackers such as those capable of seamlessly taking over a GPS receiver, which is currently receiving legitimate satellite signals, and spoofing them to an arbitrary location. Also, there is no hardware platform that can be used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of existing countermeasures in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present SPREE, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first GPS receiver capable of detecting all spoofing attacks described in literature. Our novel spoofing detection technique called auxiliary peak tracking enables detection of even a strong attacker capable of executing the seamless takeover attack. We implement and evaluate our receiver against three different sets of GPS signal traces and show that SPREE constrains even a strong attacker (capable of seamless takeover attack) from spoofing the receiver to a location not more than 1 km away from its true location. This is a significant improvement over modern GPS receivers that can be spoofed to any arbitrary location. Finally, we release our implementation and datasets to the community for further research and development.

- *Nitin Rathi, Helia Naeimi, Swaroop Ghosh*

- `1603.06675v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06675v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06675v1)

> Spin Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM) is a promising candidate for Last Level Cache (LLC) due to high endurance, high density and low leakage. One of the major disadvantages of STTRAM is high write latency and write current. Additionally, the latency and current depends on the polarity of the data being written. These features introduce major security vulnerabilities and expose the cache memory to side channel attacks. In this paper we propose a novel side channel attack model where the adversary can monitor the supply current of the memory array to partially identify the sensitive cache data that is being read or written. We propose several low cost solutions such as short retention STTRAM, 1-bit parity, multi-bit random write and constant current write driver to mitigate the attack. 1-bit parity reduces the number of distinct write current states by 30% for 32-bit word and the current signature is further obfuscated by multi-bit random writes. The constant current write makes it more challenging for the attacker to extract the entire word using a single supply current signature.

> Due to non-experts also developing security relevant applications it is necessary to support them too. Some improvements in the current research may not reach or impact these developers. Nonetheless these developers use security libraries. There are findings that even their usage is not easily possible and applications are left vulnerable to supposedly treated threats. So it is important to improve the usability of the security libraries. This is itself is not straightforward because of a required maturing process for example. By getting together experts of different involved areas, especially cryptographic and API-usability experts, both of the problems can be tackled.

> Traditional security analyses are often geared towards cryptographic primitives or protocols. Although such analyses are necessary, they cannot address a defender's need for insight into {\em which aspects of a networked system having a significant impact on its security, and how to tune its configurations or parameters so as to improve security}. This question is known to be notoriously difficult to answer, and the state-of-the-art is that we know little about it. Towards ultimately addressing this question, this paper presents a stochastic model for quantifying security of networked systems. The resulting model captures two aspects of a networked system: (1) the strength of deployed security mechanisms such as intrusion detection systems, and (2) the underlying {\em vulnerability graph}, which reflects how attacks may proceed. The resulting model brings the following insights: (1) How should a defender "tune" system configurations (e.g., network topology) so as to improve security? (2) How should a defender "tune" system parameters (e.g., by upgrading which security mechanisms) so as to improve security? (3) Under what conditions is the steady-state number of compromised entities of interest below a given threshold with a high probability? Simulation studies are conducted to confirm the analytic results, and to show the tightness of the bounds of certain important metric that cannot be resolved analytically.

> This paper presents first steps toward robust models for crisis prediction. We conduct a horse race of conventional statistical methods and more recent machine learning methods as early-warning models. As individual models are in the literature most often built in isolation of other methods, the exercise is of high relevance for assessing the relative performance of a wide variety of methods. Further, we test various ensemble approaches to aggregating the information products of the built models, providing a more robust basis for measuring country-level vulnerabilities. Finally, we provide approaches to estimating model uncertainty in early-warning exercises, particularly model performance uncertainty and model output uncertainty. The approaches put forward in this paper are shown with Europe as a playground. Generally, our results show that the conventional statistical approaches are outperformed by more advanced machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbors and neural networks, and particularly by model aggregation approaches through ensemble learning.

> Privacy-preservation for sensitive data has become a challenging issue in cloud computing. Threat modeling as a part of requirements engineering in secure software development provides a structured approach for identifying attacks and proposing countermeasures against the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a system . This paper describes an extension of Cloud Privacy Threat Modeling (CPTM) methodology for privacy threat modeling in relation to processing sensitive data in cloud computing environments. It describes the modeling methodology that involved applying Method Engineering to specify characteristics of a cloud privacy threat modeling methodology, different steps in the proposed methodology and corresponding products. In addition, a case study has been implemented as a proof of concept to demonstrate the usability of the proposed methodology. We believe that the extended methodology facilitates the application of a privacy-preserving cloud software development approach from requirements engineering to design.

> Research on cache attacks has shown that CPU caches leak significant information. Proposed detection mechanisms assume that all cache attacks cause more cache hits and cache misses than benign applications and use hardware performance counters for detection.   In this article, we show that this assumption does not hold by developing a novel attack technique: the Flush+Flush attack. The Flush+Flush attack only relies on the execution time of the flush instruction, which depends on whether data is cached or not. Flush+Flush does not make any memory accesses, contrary to any other cache attack. Thus, it causes no cache misses at all and the number of cache hits is reduced to a minimum due to the constant cache flushes. Therefore, Flush+Flush attacks are stealthy, i.e., the spy process cannot be detected based on cache hits and misses, or state-of-the-art detection mechanisms. The Flush+Flush attack runs in a higher frequency and thus is faster than any existing cache attack. With 496 KB/s in a cross-core covert channel it is 6.7 times faster than any previously published cache covert channel.

> A fundamental assumption in software security is that a memory location can only be modified by processes that may write to this memory location. However, a recent study has shown that parasitic effects in DRAM can change the content of a memory cell without accessing it, but by accessing other memory locations in a high frequency. This so-called Rowhammer bug occurs in most of today's memory modules and has fatal consequences for the security of all affected systems, e.g., privilege escalation attacks.   All studies and attacks related to Rowhammer so far rely on the availability of a cache flush instruction in order to cause accesses to DRAM modules at a sufficiently high frequency. We overcome this limitation by defeating complex cache replacement policies. We show that caches can be forced into fast cache eviction to trigger the Rowhammer bug with only regular memory accesses. This allows to trigger the Rowhammer bug in highly restricted and even scripting environments.   We demonstrate a fully automated attack that requires nothing but a website with JavaScript to trigger faults on remote hardware. Thereby we can gain unrestricted access to systems of website visitors. We show that the attack works on off-the-shelf systems. Existing countermeasures fail to protect against this new Rowhammer attack.

> The back-propagation algorithm is widely used for learning in artificial neural networks. A challenge in machine learning is to create models that generalize to new data samples not seen in the training data. Recently, a common flaw in several machine learning algorithms was discovered: small perturbations added to the input data lead to consistent misclassification of data samples. Samples that easily mislead the model are called adversarial examples. Training a "maxout" network on adversarial examples has shown to decrease this vulnerability, but also increase classification performance. This paper shows that adversarial training has a regularizing effect also in networks with logistic, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. A simple extension to the back-propagation method is proposed, that adds an adversarial gradient to the training. The extension requires an additional forward and backward pass to calculate a modified input sample, or mini batch, used as input for standard back-propagation learning. The first experimental results on MNIST show that the "adversarial back-propagation" method increases the resistance to adversarial examples and boosts the classification performance. The extension reduces the classification error on the permutation invariant MNIST from 1.60% to 0.95% in a logistic network, and from 1.40% to 0.78% in a network with rectified linear units. Results on CIFAR-10 indicate that the method has a regularizing effect similar to dropout in fully connected networks. Based on these promising results, adversarial back-propagation is proposed as a stand-alone regularizing method that should be further investigated.

> Eliminating vulnerabilities from low-level code is vital for securing software. Static analysis is a promising approach for discovering vulnerabilities since it can provide developers early feedback on the code they write. But, it presents multiple challenges not the least of which is understanding what makes a bug exploitable and conveying this information to the developer. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a practical vulnerability assessment framework, called Melange. Melange performs data and control flow analysis to diagnose potential security bugs, and outputs well-formatted bug reports that help developers understand and fix security bugs. Based on the intuition that real-world vulnerabilities manifest themselves across multiple parts of a program, Melange performs both local and global analyses. To scale up to large programs, global analysis is demand-driven. Our prototype detects multiple vulnerability classes in C and C++ code including type confusion, and garbage memory reads. We have evaluated Melange extensively. Our case studies show that Melange scales up to large codebases such as Chromium, is easy-to-use, and most importantly, capable of discovering vulnerabilities in real-world code. Our findings indicate that static analysis is a viable reinforcement to the software testing tool set.

> Many practical learning systems aggregate data across many users, while learning theory traditionally considers a single learner who trusts all of their observations. A case in point is the foundational learning problem of prediction with expert advice. To date, there has been no theoretical study of the general collaborative version of prediction with expert advice, in which many users face a similar problem and would like to share their experiences in order to learn faster. A key issue in this collaborative framework is robustness: generally algorithms that aggregate data are vulnerable to manipulation by even a small number of dishonest users.   We exhibit the first robust collaborative algorithm for prediction with expert advice. When all users are honest and have similar tastes our algorithm matches the performance of pooling data and using a traditional algorithm. But our algorithm also guarantees that adding users never significantly degrades performance, even if the additional users behave adversarially. We achieve strong guarantees even when the overwhelming majority of users behave adversarially. As a special case, our algorithm is extremely robust to variation amongst the users.

- *Martin Georgiev, Vitaly Shmatikov*

- `1604.02734v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02734v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02734v1)

> Modern cloud services are designed to encourage and support collaboration. To help users share links to online documents, maps, etc., several services, including cloud storage providers such as Microsoft OneDrive and mapping services such as Google Maps, directly integrate URL shorteners that convert long, unwieldy URLs into short URLs, consisting of a domain such as 1drv.ms or goo.gl and a short token.   In this paper, we demonstrate that the space of 5- and 6-character tokens included in short URLs is so small that it can be scanned using brute-force search. Therefore, all online resources that were intended to be shared with a few trusted friends or collaborators are effectively public and can be accessed by anyone. This leads to serious security and privacy vulnerabilities.   In the case of cloud storage, we focus on Microsoft OneDrive. We show how to use short-URL enumeration to discover and read shared content stored in the OneDrive cloud, including even files for which the user did not generate a short URL. 7% of the OneDrive accounts exposed in this fashion allow anyone to write into them. Since cloud-stored files are automatically copied into users' personal computers and devices, this is a vector for large-scale, automated malware injection.   In the case of online maps, we show how short-URL enumeration reveals the directions that users shared with each other. For many individual users, this enables inference of their residential addresses, true identities, and extremely sensitive locations they visited that, if publicly revealed, would violate medical and financial privacy.

> The unique identities of every mobile user (phone number,IMSI) and device (IMEI) are far from secure and are increasingly vulnerable to a variety of network-level threats. The exceedingly high reliance on the weak SIM authentication layer does not present any notion of end-to-end security for mobile users. We propose the design and implementation of Secure Mobile Identities (SMI), a repetitive key-exchange protocol that uses this weak SIM authentication as a foundation to enable mobile users to establish stronger identity authenticity. The security guarantees of SMI are directly reliant on the mobility of users and are further enhanced by external trusted entities providing trusted location signatures (e.g. trusted GPS, NFC synchronization points). In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of our protocol using an implementation and analysis across standard mobility models.

> This paper examines the security vulnerabilities and threats imposed by the inherent open nature of wireless communications and to devise efficient defense mechanisms for improving the wireless network security. We first summarize the security requirements of wireless networks, including their authenticity, confidentiality, integrity and availability issues. Next, a comprehensive overview of security attacks encountered in wireless networks is presented in view of the network protocol architecture, where the potential security threats are discussed at each protocol layer. We also provide a survey of the existing security protocols and algorithms that are adopted in the existing wireless network standards, such as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and the long-term evolution (LTE) systems. Then, we discuss the state-of-the-art in physical-layer security, which is an emerging technique of securing the open communications environment against eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer. We also introduce the family of various jamming attacks and their counter-measures, including the constant jammer, intermittent jammer, reactive jammer, adaptive jammer and intelligent jammer. Additionally, we discuss the integration of physical-layer security into existing authentication and cryptography mechanisms for further securing wireless networks. Finally, some technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are summarized and the future trends in wireless security are discussed.

> In Android, communications between apps and system services are supported by a transaction-based Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism. Binder, as the cornerstone of this IPC mechanism, separates two communicating parties as client and server. As with any client-server model, the server should not make any assumption on the validity (sanity) of client-side transaction. To our surprise, we find this principle has frequently been overlooked in the implementation of Android system services. In this paper, we demonstrate the prevalence and severity of this vulnerability surface and try to answer why developers keep making this seemingly simple mistake. Specifically, we design and implement BinderCracker, an automatic testing framework that supports parameter-aware fuzzing and has identified more than 100 vulnerabilities in six major versions of Android, including the latest version Android 6.0, Marshmallow. Some of the vulnerabilities have severe security implications, causing privileged code execution or permanent Denial-of-Service (DoS). We analyzed the root causes of these vulnerabilities to find that most of them exist because system service developers only considered exploitations via public APIs. We thus highlight the deficiency of testing only on client-side public APIs and argue for the necessity of testing and protection on the Binder interface - the actual security boundary. Specifically, we discuss the effectiveness and practicality of potential countermeasures, such as precautionary testing and runtime diagnostic.

> This paper proposes a novel, non-linear collusion attack on digital fingerprinting systems. The attack is proposed for fingerprinting systems with finite alphabet but can be extended to continuous alphabet. We analyze the error probability of the attack for some classes of proposed random and deterministic schemes and obtain a bound on the number of colluders necessary to correctly estimate the host signal. That is, it requires fewer number of colluders to defeat the fingerprinting scheme. Our simulation results show that our attack is more powerful in practice than predicted by the theoretical bound.

> Machine learning models are frequently used to solve complex security problems, as well as to make decisions in sensitive situations like guiding autonomous vehicles or predicting financial market behaviors. Previous efforts have shown that numerous machine learning models were vulnerable to adversarial manipulations of their inputs taking the form of adversarial samples. Such inputs are crafted by adding carefully selected perturbations to legitimate inputs so as to force the machine learning model to misbehave, for instance by outputting a wrong class if the machine learning task of interest is classification. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, all previous work on adversarial samples crafting for neural network considered models used to solve classification tasks, most frequently in computer vision applications. In this paper, we contribute to the field of adversarial machine learning by investigating adversarial input sequences for recurrent neural networks processing sequential data. We show that the classes of algorithms introduced previously to craft adversarial samples misclassified by feed-forward neural networks can be adapted to recurrent neural networks. In a experiment, we show that adversaries can craft adversarial sequences misleading both categorical and sequential recurrent neural networks.

> Power side-channel attacks are a very effective cryptanalysis technique that can infer secret keys of security ICs by monitoring the power consumption. Since the emergence of practical attacks in the late 90s, they have been a major threat to many cryptographic-equipped devices including smart cards, encrypted FPGA designs, and mobile phones. Designers and manufacturers of cryptographic devices have in response developed various countermeasures for protection. Attacking methods have also evolved to counteract resistant implementations. This paper reviews foundational power analysis attack techniques and examines a variety of hardware design mitigations. The aim is to highlight exposed vulnerabilities in hardware-based countermeasures for future more secure implementations.

- `1605.00684v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00684v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00684v1)

> With current tools and technology, someone who has physical access to a chip can extract the detailed layout of the integrated circuit (IC). By using advanced visual imaging techniques, reverse engineering can reveal details that are meant to be kept secret, such as a secure protocol or novel implementation that offers a competitive advantage. A promising solution to defend against reverse engineering attacks is IC camouflaging. In this work, we propose a new camouflaging technique based on the threshold voltage of the transistors. We refer to these cells as threshold dependent camouflaged cells. Our work differs from current commercial solutions in that the latter use look-alike cells, with the assumption that it is difficult for the reverse engineer to identify the cell's functionality. Yet, if a structural distinction between cells exists, then these are still vulnerable, especially as reverse engineers use more advanced and precise techniques. On the other hand, the proposed threshold dependent standard cells are structurally identical regardless of the cells' functionality. Detailed circuit simulations of our proposed threshold dependent camouflaged cells demonstrate that they can be used to cost-effectively and robustly camouflage large netlists. Corner analysis of process, temperature, and supply voltage (PVT) variations show that our cells operate as expected over all PVT corners simulated.

- *Babins Shrestha, Manar Mohamed, Nitesh Saxena*

- `1605.00766v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00766v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00766v1)

> Zero-interaction authentication (ZIA) refers to a form of user-transparent login mechanism using which a terminal (e.g., a desktop computer) can be unlocked by the mere proximity of an authentication token (e.g., a smartphone). Given its appealing usability, ZIA has already been deployed in many real-world applications. However, ZIA contains one major security weakness - unauthorized physical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the attacker to have unfettered access to the terminal.   In this paper, we address this gaping vulnerability with ZIA systems by (un)locking the authentication token with the user's walking pattern as she approaches the terminal to access it. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is believed to be unique, only that user (no imposter) would be able to unlock the token to gain access to the terminal in a ZIA session. While walking-based biometrics schemes have been studied in prior literature for other application settings, our main novelty lies in the careful use of: (1) multiple sensors available on the current breed of devices (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer), and (2) multiple devices carried by the user (in particular, an "in-pocket" smartphone and a "wrist-worn" smartwatch), that all capture unique facets of user's walking pattern. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we introduce, design and implement WUZIA ("Walk-Unlock ZIA"), a multi-modal walking biometrics approach tailored to enhance the security of ZIA systems (still with zero interaction). Second, we demonstrate that WUZIA offers a high degree of detection accuracy, based on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion. Third, we show that WUZIA can resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a user's walking pattern, especially when multiple devices are used.

While glue is widely used and heavily relied on in DNS operations, there is little thinking about the necessity, complexity, and venerability of such prevalent configuration. This work is the first to provide extensive and systematic analysis of DNS glue. It discusses the availability implications of glue and proposes the minimum glue records in terms of availability. It also identifies the security vulnerabilities of glue as well as the limitations of current countermeasures. Measurements show the wide occurrences of glue redundancies and glue vulnerabilities.

A single intrusion into these types of websites can lead to overall control of websites by the attacker. Researchers are aware of the basic SQL Injection attacks but there are numerous SQL Injection attacks which are yet to be Prevented and Detected. Over here, we present the extensive review for the Advanced SQL Injection attack such as Fast Flux Sql Injection, Compounded SQL Injection and Deep Blind SQL Injection. We also analyze the detection and prevention using the classical methods as well as modern approaches. We will be discussing the Comparative Evaluation for prevention of SQL Injection.

> Embedded sensing systems are pervasively used in life- and security-critical systems such as those found in airplanes, automobiles, and healthcare. Traditional security mechanisms for these sensors focus on data encryption and other post-processing techniques, but the sensors themselves often remain vulnerable to attacks in the physical/analog domain. If an adversary manipulates a physical/analog signal prior to digitization, no amount of digital security mechanisms after the fact can help. Fortunately, nature imposes fundamental constraints on how these analog signals can behave. This work presents PyCRA, a physical challenge-response authentication scheme designed to protect active sensing systems against physical attacks occurring in the analog domain. PyCRA provides security for active sensors by continually challenging the surrounding environment via random but deliberate physical probes. By analyzing the responses to these probes, and by using the fact that the adversary cannot change the underlying laws of physics, we provide an authentication mechanism that not only detects malicious attacks but provides resilience against them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PyCRA through several case studies using two sensing systems: (1) magnetic sensors like those found wheel speed sensors in robotics and automotive, and (2) commercial RFID tags used in many security-critical applications. Finally, we outline methods and theoretical proofs for further enhancing the resilience of PyCRA to active attacks by means of a confusion phase---a period of low signal to noise ratio that makes it more difficult for an attacker to correctly identify and respond to PyCRA's physical challenges. In doing so, we evaluate both the robustness and the limitations of PyCRA, concluding by outlining practical considerations as well as further applications for the proposed authentication mechanism.

> Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validate the proposed approach.

> Modern web browsers are incredibly complex, with millions of lines of code and over one thousand JavaScript functions and properties available to website authors. This work investigates how these browser features are used on the modern, open web. We find that JavaScript features differ wildly in popularity, with over 50% of provided features never used in the Alexa 10k.   We also look at how popular ad and tracking blockers change the distribution of features used by sites, and identify a set of approximately 10% of features that are disproportionately blocked (prevented from executing by these extensions at least 90% of the time they are used). We additionally find that in the presence of these blockers, over 83% of available features are executed on less than 1% of the most popular 10,000 websites.   We additionally measure a variety of aspects of browser feature usage on the web, including how complex sites have become in terms of feature usage, how the length of time a browser feature has been in the browser relates to its usage on the web, and how many security vulnerabilities have been associated with related browser features.

> In this paper, we present that security threats coming with existing GPU memory management strategy are overlooked, which opens a back door for adversaries to freely break the memory isolation: they enable adversaries without any privilege in a computer to recover the raw memory data left by previous processes directly. More importantly, such attacks can work on not only normal multi-user operating systems, but also cloud computing platforms.   To demonstrate the seriousness of such attacks, we recovered original data directly from GPU memory residues left by exited commodity applications, including Google Chrome, Adobe Reader, GIMP, Matlab. The results show that, because of the vulnerable memory management strategy, commodity applications in our experiments are all affected.

> Preprocessors support the diversification of software products with #ifdefs, but also require additional effort from developers to maintain and understand variable code. We conjecture that #ifdefs cause developers to produce more vulnerable code because they are required to reason about multiple features simultaneously and maintain complex mental models of dependencies of configurable code.   We extracted a variational call graph across all configurations of the Linux kernel, and used configuration complexity metrics to compare vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions considering their vulnerability history. Our goal was to learn about whether we can observe a measurable influence of configuration complexity on the occurrence of vulnerabilities.   Our results suggest, among others, that vulnerable functions have higher variability than non-vulnerable ones and are also constrained by fewer configuration options. This suggests that developers are inclined to notice functions appear in frequently-compiled product variants. We aim to raise developers' awareness to address variability more systematically, since configuration complexity is an important, but often ignored aspect of software product lines.

> Many machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples: inputs that are specially crafted to cause a machine learning model to produce an incorrect output. Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect another model, even if the two models have different architectures or were trained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained to perform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute model, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them to a victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work has further developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label a synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not even collect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques using reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training procedure for the substitute model. We introduce new transferability attacks between previously unexplored (substitute, victim) pairs of machine learning model classes, most notably SVMs and decision trees. We demonstrate our attacks on two commercial machine learning classification systems from Amazon (96.19% misclassification rate) and Google (88.94%) using only 800 queries of the victim model, thereby showing that existing machine learning approaches are in general vulnerable to systematic black-box attacks regardless of their structure.

> We present and evaluate a large-scale malware detection system integrating machine learning with expert reviewers, treating reviewers as a limited labeling resource. We demonstrate that even in small numbers, reviewers can vastly improve the system's ability to keep pace with evolving threats. We conduct our evaluation on a sample of VirusTotal submissions spanning 2.5 years and containing 1.1 million binaries with 778GB of raw feature data. Without reviewer assistance, we achieve 72% detection at a 0.5% false positive rate, performing comparable to the best vendors on VirusTotal. Given a budget of 80 accurate reviews daily, we improve detection to 89% and are able to detect 42% of malicious binaries undetected upon initial submission to VirusTotal. Additionally, we identify a previously unnoticed temporal inconsistency in the labeling of training datasets. We compare the impact of training labels obtained at the same time training data is first seen with training labels obtained months later. We find that using training labels obtained well after samples appear, and thus unavailable in practice for current training data, inflates measured detection by almost 20 percentage points. We release our cluster-based implementation, as well as a list of all hashes in our evaluation and 3% of our entire dataset.

The threats and dangers posed by the smartphones to the enterprise are also ever-growing. Such dangers can be mitigated by running the enterprise software inside a "secure container" on the smartphone. In our work we present a systematic assessment of security critical areas in design and implementation of a secure container for Android using reverse engineering and attacker-inspired methods. We do this through a case-study of Samsung KNOX, a real-world product deployed on millions of devices. Our research shows how KNOX security features work behind the scenes and lets us compare the vendor's public security claims against reality. Along the way we identified several design weaknesses and a few vulnerabilities that were disclosed to Samsung.

> Cloud computing provides an effective business model for the deployment of IT infrastructure, platform, and software services. Often, facilities are outsourced to cloud providers and this offers the service consumer virtualization technologies without the added cost burden of development. However, virtualization introduces serious threats to service delivery such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Cross-VM Cache Side Channel attacks, Hypervisor Escape and Hyper-jacking. One of the most sophisticated forms of attack is the cross-VM cache side channel attack that exploits shared cache memory between VMs. A cache side channel attack results in side channel data leakage, such as cryptographic keys. Various techniques used by the attackers to launch cache side channel attack are presented, as is a critical analysis of countermeasures against cache side channel attacks.

It is common for image owners to embed watermarks and other security mechanisms into their property so that the rightful ownership may be identified. In this paper we present a design that overcomes many of the current limitations in cloud watermarking uses and propose a schema that places responsibility on the cloud provider to have a robust information protection program. Such a design solution lays out an information security architecture that enhances utility for cloud services and gives better options for users to securely place properties in the cloud.

> Government organisations utilise a Citizen's Charter in order to furnish the public with comprehensive details of their service offerings that defines how their overall organisational goals are achieved. Studies on the implementation of Citizen's Charter in developing countries indicated that important social factors were not considered. Reviewed literatures indicated that social factors could accelerate service delivery with the use of goal-oriented modelling (such as i* organisational modeling) as it represent conditions expected from social actors and their social dependencies. By modelling role dependencies among actors carrying out services in a business unit and applying vulnerability and criticality metrics, problem service areas were identified using the Citizen's Charter as a source of these methodologies. Improvements in these problem service areas were based on vulnerability and criticality levels of their corresponding actors. Recommendations to address these service areas include monitoring of key performance indicators of actors and task delegation when necessary.

> The smart grid is envisioned to significantly enhance the efficiency of energy consumption, by utilizing two-way communication channels between consumers and operators. For example, operators can opportunistically leverage the delay tolerance of energy demands in order to balance the energy load over time, and hence, reduce the total operational cost. This opportunity, however, comes with security threats, as the grid becomes more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper, we study the impact of such malicious cyber-attacks on the energy efficiency of the grid in a simplified setup. More precisely, we consider a simple model where the energy demands of the smart grid consumers are intercepted and altered by an active attacker before they arrive at the operator, who is equipped with limited intrusion detection capabilities. We formulate the resulting optimization problems faced by the operator and the attacker and propose several scheduling and attack strategies for both parties. Interestingly, our results show that, as opposed to facilitating cost reduction in the smart grid, increasing the delay tolerance of the energy demands potentially allows the attacker to force increased costs on the system. This highlights the need for carefully constructed and robust intrusion detection mechanisms at the operator.

> The monitoring and management of high-volume feature-rich traffic in large networks offers significant challenges in storage, transmission and computational costs. The predominant approach to reducing these costs is based on performing a linear mapping of the data to a low-dimensional subspace such that a certain large percentage of the variance in the data is preserved in the low-dimensional representation. This variance-based subspace approach to dimensionality reduction forces a fixed choice of the number of dimensions, is not responsive to real-time shifts in observed traffic patterns, and is vulnerable to normal traffic spoofing. Based on theoretical insights proved in this paper, we propose a new distance-based approach to dimensionality reduction motivated by the fact that the real-time structural differences between the covariance matrices of the observed and the normal traffic is more relevant to anomaly detection than the structure of the training data alone. Our approach, called the distance-based subspace method, allows a different number of reduced dimensions in different time windows and arrives at only the number of dimensions necessary for effective anomaly detection. We present centralized and distributed versions of our algorithm and, using simulation on real traffic traces, demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative advantages of the distance-based subspace approach.

> Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles crossing an intersection, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and their safety-critical nature makes them a target for malicious adversaries. This paper studies the problem of supervisory control of autonomous intersections in the presence of sensor attacks. Sensor attacks are performed when an adversary gains access to the transmission channel and corrupts the measurements before they are received by the decision-making unit. We show that the supervisory control system is vulnerable to sensor attacks that can cause collision or deadlock among vehicles. To improve the system resilience, we introduce a detector in the control architecture and focus on stealthy attacks that cannot be detected but are capable of compromising safety. We then present a resilient supervisory control system that is safe, non-deadlocking, and maximally permissive, despite the presence of disturbances, uncontrolled vehicles, and sensor attacks. Finally, we demonstrate how the resilient supervisor works by considering illustrative examples.

> Attack graphs provide compact representations of the attack paths that an attacker can follow to compromise network resources by analysing network vulnerabilities and topology. These representations are a powerful tool for security risk assessment. Bayesian inference on attack graphs enables the estimation of the risk of compromise to the system's components given their vulnerabilities and interconnections, and accounts for multi-step attacks spreading through the system. Whilst static analysis considers the risk posture at rest, dynamic analysis also accounts for evidence of compromise, e.g. from SIEM software or forensic investigation. However, in this context, exact Bayesian inference techniques do not scale well. In this paper we show how Loopy Belief Propagation - an approximate inference technique - can be applied to attack graphs, and that it scales linearly in the number of nodes for both static and dynamic analysis, making such analyses viable for larger networks. We experiment with different topologies and network clustering on synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with thousands of nodes to show that the algorithm's accuracy is acceptable and converge to a stable solution. We compare sequential and parallel versions of Loopy Belief Propagation with exact inference techniques for both static and dynamic analysis, showing the advantages of approximate inference techniques to scale to larger attack graphs.

> Because of the threat of advanced multi-step attacks, it is often difficult for security operators to completely cover all vulnerabilities when deploying remediations. Deploying sensors to monitor attacks exploiting residual vulnerabilities is not sufficient and new tools are needed to assess the risk associated to the security events produced by these sensors. Although attack graphs were proposed to represent known multi-step attacks occurring in an information system, they are not directly suited for dynamic risk assessment. In this paper, we present the Bayesian Attack Model (BAM), a Bayesian network-based extension to topological attack graphs, capable of handling topological cycles, making it fit for any information system. Evaluation is performed on realistic topologies to study the sensitivity of its probabilistic parameters.

> As has been widely discussed, the GSM mobile telephony system only offers unilateral authentication of the mobile phone to the network; this limitation permits a range of attacks. While adding support for mutual authentication would be highly beneficial, changing the way GSM serving networks operate is not practical. This paper proposes a novel modification to the relationship between a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) and its home network which allows mutual authentication without changing any of the existing mobile infrastructure, including the phones; the only necessary changes are to the authentication centres and the SIMs. This enhancement, which could be deployed piecemeal in a completely transparent way, not only addresses a number of serious vulnerabilities in GSM but is also the first proposal for enhancing GSM authentication that possesses such transparency properties.

> Many real-life planning problems require making a priori decisions before all parameters of the problem have been revealed. An important special case of such problem arises in scheduling problems, where a set of tasks needs to be assigned to the available set of machines or personnel (resources), in a way that all tasks have assigned resources, and no two tasks share the same resource. In its nominal form, the resulting computational problem becomes the \emph{assignment problem} on general bipartite graphs.   This paper deals with a robust variant of the assignment problem modeling situations where certain edges in the corresponding graph are \emph{vulnerable} and may become unavailable after a solution has been chosen. The goal is to choose a minimum-cost collection of edges such that if any vulnerable edge becomes unavailable, the remaining part of the solution contains an assignment of all tasks.   We present approximation results and hardness proofs for this type of problems, and establish several connections to well-known concepts from matching theory, robust optimization and LP-based techniques.

> The recent evolution on the smart phone technology has made its application market huge and less secure. Every single day large number of apps introduced in the android market (mostly on google play store) without any particular inspections which creates a lot of security issues and they remain unresolved. There are a lot of recent and increasing security issues which are mostly caused by the android apps. Mainly, the access of user data through the apps relied on the users given permission to apps.So, it is always a big question that how different apps on the android smart phones bypass the android permission model to have root access and how user data compromised or stolen by its apps. It is not startling that the Google Play Store has massive number of malicious apps that may gain users attention to fall victim for one, but some time it might be even worse than we thought. In this paper, we will look at the security issues (i.e. rooting phone, malware bypassing and secondary storage) and how easy to get access to users phone by using its app.   Furthermore, I will discuss the android update mechanism and its functionalities as well as vulnerability to possible third party bypassing and root access. Moreover, a key feature and source of the all possible access route to android applications I will discuss an android permission model. Finally, I will first time present concept of the feature based development model implementing a feature based permission selections as a solution to android application system and describe the purposed Feature based permission model in detail how it is the solution for current security issues caused by intentional (evil coded) or unintentional (poorly coded) coding using android permission models.

> The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest mobile standard being implemented globally to provide connectivity and access to advanced services for personal mobile devices. Moreover, LTE networks are considered to be one of the main pillars for the deployment of Machine to Machine (M2M) communication systems and the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT). As an enabler for advanced communications services with a subscription count in the billions, security is of capital importance in LTE. Although legacy GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks are known for being insecure and vulnerable to rogue base stations, LTE is assumed to guarantee confidentiality and strong authentication. However, LTE networks are vulnerable to security threats that tamper availability, privacy and authentication. This manuscript, which summarizes and expands the results presented by the author at ShmooCon 2016 \cite{jover2016lte}, investigates the insecurity rationale behind LTE protocol exploits and LTE rogue base stations based on the analysis of real LTE radio link captures from the production network. Implementation results are discussed from the actual deployment of LTE rogue base stations, IMSI catchers and exploits that can potentially block a mobile device. A previously unknown technique to potentially track the location of mobile devices as they move from cell to cell is also discussed, with mitigations being proposed.

> Due to its scale and largely interconnected nature, the Internet of Things (IoT) will be vulnerable to a number of security threats that range from physical layer attacks to network layer attacks. In this paper, a novel anti-jamming strategy for OFDM-based IoT systems is proposed which enables an IoT controller to protect the IoT devices against a malicious radio jammer. The interaction between the controller node and the jammer is modeled as a Colonel Blotto game with continuous and asymmetric resources in which the IoT controller, acting as defender, seeks to thwart the jamming attack by distributing its power among the subcarries in a smart way to decrease the aggregate bit error rate (BER) caused by the jammer. The jammer, on the other hand, aims at disrupting the system performance by allocating jamming power to different frequency bands. To solve the game, an evolutionary algorithm is proposed which can find a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of the Blotto game. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enables the IoT controller to maintain the BER above an acceptable threshold, thereby preserving the IoT network performance in the presence of malicious jamming.

> Tor is currently the most popular network for anonymous Internet access. It critically relies on volunteer nodes called bridges for relaying Internet traffic when a user's ISP blocks connections to Tor. Unfortunately, current methods for distributing bridges are vulnerable to malicious users who obtain and block bridge addresses. In this paper, we propose TorBricks, a protocol for distributing Tor bridges to n users, even when an unknown number t < n of these users are controlled by a malicious adversary. TorBricks distributes O(tlog(n)) bridges and guarantees that all honest users can connect to Tor with high probability after O(log(t)) rounds of communication with the distributor.   We also extend our algorithm to perform privacy-preserving bridge distribution when run among multiple untrusted distributors. This not only prevents the distributors from learning bridge addresses and bridge assignment information, but also provides resistance against malicious attacks from a m/3 fraction of the distributors, where m is the number of distributors.

> Neural network image classifiers are known to be vulnerable to adversarial images, i.e., natural images which have been modified by an adversarial perturbation specifically designed to be imperceptible to humans yet fool the classifier. Not only can adversarial images be generated easily, but these images will often be adversarial for networks trained on disjoint subsets of data or with different architectures. Adversarial images represent a potential security risk as well as a serious machine learning challenge---it is clear that vulnerable neural networks perceive images very differently from humans. Noting that virtually every image classification data set is composed of JPG images, we evaluate the effect of JPG compression on the classification of adversarial images. For Fast-Gradient-Sign perturbations of small magnitude, we found that JPG compression often reverses the drop in classification accuracy to a large extent, but not always. As the magnitude of the perturbations increases, JPG recompression alone is insufficient to reverse the effect.

> The OAuth 2.0 protocol is one of the most widely deployed authorization/single sign-on (SSO) protocols and also serves as the foundation for the new SSO standard OpenID Connect. Despite the popularity of OAuth, so far analysis efforts were mostly targeted at finding bugs in specific implementations and were based on formal models which abstract from many web features or did not provide a formal treatment at all.   In this paper, we carry out the first extensive formal analysis of the OAuth 2.0 standard in an expressive web model. Our analysis aims at establishing strong authorization, authentication, and session integrity guarantees, for which we provide formal definitions. In our formal analysis, all four OAuth grant types (authorization code grant, implicit grant, resource owner password credentials grant, and the client credentials grant) are covered. They may even run simultaneously in the same and different relying parties and identity providers, where malicious relying parties, identity providers, and browsers are considered as well. Our modeling and analysis of the OAuth 2.0 standard assumes that security recommendations and best practices are followed, in order to avoid obvious and known attacks.   When proving the security of OAuth in our model, we discovered four attacks which break the security of OAuth. The vulnerabilities can be exploited in practice and are present also in OpenID Connect.   We propose fixes for the identified vulnerabilities, and then, for the first time, actually prove the security of OAuth in an expressive web model. In particular, we show that the fixed version of OAuth (with security recommendations and best practices in place) provides the authorization, authentication, and session integrity properties we specify.

> Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a network architecture that aims at providing high flexibility through the separation of the network logic from the forwarding functions. The industry has already widely adopted SDN and researchers thoroughly analyzed its vulnerabilities, proposing solutions to improve its security. However, we believe important security aspects of SDN are still left uninvestigated. In this paper, we raise the concern of the possibility for an attacker to obtain knowledge about an SDN network. In particular, we introduce a novel attack, named Know Your Enemy (KYE), by means of which an attacker can gather vital information about the configuration of the network. This information ranges from the configuration of security tools, such as attack detection thresholds for network scanning, to general network policies like QoS and network virtualization. Additionally, we show that an attacker can perform a KYE attack in a stealthy fashion, i.e., without the risk of being detected. We underline that the vulnerability exploited by the KYE attack is proper of SDN and is not present in legacy networks. To address the KYE attack, we also propose an active defense countermeasure based on network flows obfuscation, which considerably increases the complexity for a successful attack. Our solution offers provable security guarantees that can be tailored to the needs of the specific network under consideration

> Remote attestation is a crucial security service particularly relevant to increasingly popular IoT (and other embedded) devices. It allows a trusted party (verifier) to learn the state of a remote, and potentially malware-infected, device (prover). Most existing approaches are static in nature and only check whether benign software is initially loaded on the prover. However, they are vulnerable to run-time attacks that hijack the application's control or data flow, e.g., via return-oriented programming or data-oriented exploits. As a concrete step towards more comprehensive run-time remote attestation, we present the design and implementation of Control- FLow ATtestation (C-FLAT) that enables remote attestation of an application's control-flow path, without requiring the source code. We describe a full prototype implementation of C-FLAT on Raspberry Pi using its ARM TrustZone hardware security extensions. We evaluate C-FLAT's performance using a real-world embedded (cyber-physical) application, and demonstrate its efficacy against control-flow hijacking attacks.

> The Internet of Things IoT is experiencing exponential growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from privacy and security vulnerabilities. Conventional security and privacy approaches tend to be inapplicable for IoT, mainly due to its decentralized topology and the resource-constraints of the majority of its devices. BlockChain BC that underpin the crypto-currency Bitcoin have been recently used to provide security and privacy in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies to IoT. However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for IoT devices. This position paper proposes a new secure, private, and lightweight architecture for IoT, based on BC technology that eliminates the overhead of BC while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. The described method is investigated on a smart home application as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. The proposed architecture is hierarchical, and consists of smart homes, an overlay network and cloud storages coordinating data transactions with BC to provide privacy and security. Our design uses different types of BCs depending on where in the network hierarchy a transaction occurs, and uses distributed trust methods to ensure a decentralized topology. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications.

> Software components for on-board architectures in the space domain are increasingly reliant on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Open Source (OSS) or other third party software products. However, these software components often have not been built with mission critical requirements in mind. Development project teams incorporating these products have limited knowledge of or control over the processes applied during the design, implementation, testing and maintenance of selected COTS/OSS software products. These constraints generate uncertainty of potential software induced failures. Moreover, the lack of information regarding security vulnerabilities increases the risks of their usage, since their exploitation might lead to undesired behaviour of the software and therefore to a system failure. The purpose of this paper is to present a combined approach that takes into account reliability and security enhancements for third party software, based on Time-Space Partitioning and Multiple Levels of Security.

> Anonymous social media platforms like Secret, Yik Yak, and Whisper have emerged as important tools for sharing ideas without the fear of judgment. Such anonymous platforms are also important in nations under authoritarian rule, where freedom of expression and the personal safety of message authors may depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or retribution, it is sometimes crucial to hide the identities of users who post sensitive messages. In this paper, we consider a global adversary who wishes to identify the author of a message; it observes either a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time, sampled timestamp metadata, or both. Recent advances in rumor source detection show that existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive diffusion, and show that under the snapshot adversarial model, adaptive diffusion spreads content fast and achieves perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree. That is, all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message. When the contact network is an irregular tree, we characterize the probability of maximum likelihood detection by proving a concentration result over Galton-Watson trees. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network demonstrate that adaptive diffusion effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles.

> Due to physical isolation as well as use of proprietary hardware and protocols, traditional real-time systems (RTS) were considered to be invulnerable to security breaches and external attacks. However, this assumption is being challenged by recent attacks that highlight the vulnerabilities in such systems. In this paper, we focus on integrating security mechanisms into RTS (especially legacy RTS) and provide a metric to measure the effectiveness of such mechanisms. We combine opportunistic execution with hierarchical scheduling to maintain compatibility with legacy systems while still providing flexibility. The proposed approach is shown to increase the security posture of RTS systems without impacting their temporal constraints.

> Several recent works have shown that state-of-the-art classifiers are vulnerable to worst-case (i.e., adversarial) perturbations of the datapoints. On the other hand, it has been empirically observed that these same classifiers are relatively robust to random noise. In this paper, we propose to study a \textit{semi-random} noise regime that generalizes both the random and worst-case noise regimes. We propose the first quantitative analysis of the robustness of nonlinear classifiers in this general noise regime. We establish precise theoretical bounds on the robustness of classifiers in this general regime, which depend on the curvature of the classifier's decision boundary. Our bounds confirm and quantify the empirical observations that classifiers satisfying curvature constraints are robust to random noise. Moreover, we quantify the robustness of classifiers in terms of the subspace dimension in the semi-random noise regime, and show that our bounds remarkably interpolate between the worst-case and random noise regimes. We perform experiments and show that the derived bounds provide very accurate estimates when applied to various state-of-the-art deep neural networks and datasets. This result suggests bounds on the curvature of the classifiers' decision boundaries that we support experimentally, and more generally offers important insights onto the geometry of high dimensional classification problems.

> Betweenness centrality is a fundamental centrality measure in social network analysis. Given a large-scale network, how can we find the most central nodes? This question is of key importance to numerous important applications that rely on betweenness centrality, including community detection and understanding graph vulnerability. Despite the large amount of work on designing scalable approximation algorithms for betweenness centrality, estimating it on large-scale networks remains a computational challenge.   In this paper, we study the Betweenness Centrality Maximization problem: given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a positive integer $k$, find a set $S^* \subseteq V$ that maximizes betweenness centrality subject to the cardinality constraint $|S^*| \leq k$. We present an efficient randomized algorithm that provides a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation with high probability, where $\epsilon>0$. Our results improve the current state-of-the-art result by Yoshida~\cite{yoshida2014almost}. Furthermore, we provide theoretical evidence for the validity of a crucial assumption in the literature of betweenness centrality estimation, namely that in real-world networks $O(|V|^2)$ shortest paths pass through the top-$k$ central nodes, where $k$ is a constant. On the experimental side, we perform an extensive experimental analysis of our method on real-world networks, demonstrate its accuracy and scalability, and study different properties of central nodes. Finally, we provide three graph mining applications of our method.

> This study evaluates the cyber-risks to Business Information Assets posed by the adoption of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) to the workplace. BYOD is an emerging trend where employees bring and use personal computing devices on the companys network to access applications and sensitive data like emails, calendar and scheduling applications, documents, etc. Employees are captivated by BYOD because they can have access to private items as well as perform certain job functions while being unrestricted to their desks. This is however usually done on the blind side of management or the system administrator; a situation that tends to expose vital and sensitive corporate information to various threats like unwanted network traffic, unknown applications, malwares, and viruses. Expert opinions were elicited in this exploratory study. The study evaluated the characteristics of BYOD, assessed associated risks, threats and vulnerabilities. The findings indicate that little or no security measures were instituted to mitigate risks associated with BYOD. Though, profound benefits abound with BYOD adoption, they could be eroded by security threats and costs of mitigation in curing breaches. The most significant risk was found to be Data Loss which was in consonance with similar studies on Smartphone security risks. Some mitigation measures are then recommended.

> Prior work has shown that multibiometric systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, assuming that their matching score distribution is identical to that of genuine users, without fabricating any fake trait. We have recently shown that this assumption is not representative of current fingerprint and face presentation attacks, leading one to overestimate the vulnerability of multibiometric systems, and to design less effective fusion rules. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a statistical meta-model of face and fingerprint presentation attacks that characterizes a wider family of fake score distributions, including distributions of known and, potentially, unknown attacks. This allows us to perform a thorough security evaluation of multibiometric systems against presentation attacks, quantifying how their vulnerability may vary also under attacks that are different from those considered during design, through an uncertainty analysis. We empirically show that our approach can reliably predict the performance of multibiometric systems even under never-before-seen face and fingerprint presentation attacks, and that the secure fusion rules designed using our approach can exhibit an improved trade-off between the performance in the absence and in the presence of attack. We finally argue that our method can be extended to other biometrics besides faces and fingerprints.

Today Instant Messaging within a Virtual Universe (IMVU) combines custom avatars, chat or instant message (IM), community, content creation, commerce, and anonymity. IMVU is also being exploited by criminals to commit a wide variety of offenses. However, there are very few researches on digital forensic acquisition of IMVU applications. In this paper, we discuss first of all on challenges of IMVU forensics. We present a forensic acquisition of an IMVU 3D application as a case study. We also describe and analyse our experiments with this application.

- *Daoyuan Wu, Debin Gao, Yingjiu Li, Robert H. Deng*

- `1609.03322v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03322v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03322v2)

> Cross-app collaboration via inter-component communication is a fundamental mechanism on Android. Although it brings the benefits such as functionality reuse and data sharing, a threat called component hijacking is also introduced. By hijacking a vulnerable component in victim apps, an attack app can escalate its privilege for originally prohibited operations. Many prior studies have been performed to understand and mitigate this issue, but component hijacking remains a serious open problem in the Android ecosystem due to no effective defense deployed in the wild. In this paper, we present our vision on practically defending against component hijacking in Android apps. First, we argue that to fundamentally prevent component hijacking, we need to switch from the previous mindset (i.e., performing system-level control or repackaging vulnerable apps after they are already released) to a more proactive version that aims to help security-inexperienced developers make secure components in the first place. To this end, we propose to embed into apps a secure component library (SecComp), which performs in-app mandatory access control on behalf of app components. An important factor for SecComp to be effective is that we find it is possible to devise a set of practical in-app policies to stop component hijacking. Furthermore, we allow developers design custom policies, beyond our by-default generic policies, to support more fine-grained access control. We have overcome challenges to implement a preliminary SecComp prototype, which stops component hijacking with very low performance overhead. We hope the future research that fully implements our vision can eventually help real-world apps get rid of component hijacking.

> Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is consisting of independent and distributed sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc. The most crucial and fundamental challenge facing WSN is security. Due to minimum capacity in-term of memory cost, processing and physical accessibility to sensors devices the security attacks are problematic. They are mostly deployed in open area, which expose them to different kinds of attacks. In this paper, we present an illustration of different attacks and vulnerabilities in WSN. Then we describe and analyze security requirement, countermeasures based on cryptography mechanisms in literature. Finally, we present possible directions in future research.

Research concerning quantum cryptography is analyzed in terms of work done by the University of Cambridge in partnership with a division of Toshiba, and also attacks demonstrated by Swedish researchers against QKD of energy-time entangled systems. Quantum computing is covered in terms of classical cryptography related to weaknesses presented by Shor's algorithm. Previous classical vulnerabilities also discussed were conducted by Israeli researchers as a side-channel attack using parabolic curve microphones, which has since been patched.

> Not long ago, it was thought that only software applications and general purpose digital systems i.e. computers were prone to various types of attacks against their security. The underlying hardware, hardware implementations of these software applications, embedded systems, and hardware devices were considered to be secure and out of reach of these attacks. However, during the previous few years, it has been demonstrated that novel attacks against the hardware and embedded systems can also be mounted. Not only viruses, but worms and Trojan horses have been developed for them, and they have also been demonstrated to be effective. Whereas a lot of research has already been done in the area of security of general purpose computers and software applications, hardware and embedded systems security is a relatively new and emerging area of research. This chapter provides details of various types of existing attacks against hardware devices and embedded systems, analyzes existing design methodologies for their vulnerability to new types of attacks, and along the way describes solutions and countermeasures against them for the design and development of secure systems.

> There is no denying the fact that with the widespread usage of computers and the Internet in our daily lives, security of information and data has gained increased attention. Information stored in electronic form is more susceptible to being leaked to unauthorized individuals intentionally or without intent. One of the major reasons for this breach of security has been attributed to proprietary software whose source is available only to the company which made it. Thus you have no surety that the proprietary and pre-compiled software has no hole to help an individual break security of your computer or network. Philosophy of free and open source software as against this provides everyone an opportunity to view the source code for any possible vulnerabilities and compile and change it according to ones need. This paper discusses this philosophy in length with some examples and also some open source tools that help maintain computer and Internet security.

> Recommendation and collaborative filtering systems are important in modern information and e-commerce applications. As these systems are becoming increasingly popular in the industry, their outputs could affect business decision making, introducing incentives for an adversarial party to compromise the availability or integrity of such systems. We introduce a data poisoning attack on collaborative filtering systems. We demonstrate how a powerful attacker with full knowledge of the learner can generate malicious data so as to maximize his/her malicious objectives, while at the same time mimicking normal user behavior to avoid being detected. While the complete knowledge assumption seems extreme, it enables a robust assessment of the vulnerability of collaborative filtering schemes to highly motivated attacks. We present efficient solutions for two popular factorization-based collaborative filtering algorithms: the \emph{alternative minimization} formulation and the \emph{nuclear norm minimization} method. Finally, we test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on real-world data and discuss potential defensive strategies.

> Speaker verification systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks which presents a major problem in their real-life deployment. To date, most of the proposed synthetic speech detectors (SSDs) have weighted the importance of different segments of speech equally. However, different attack methods have different strengths and weaknesses and the traces that they leave may be short or long term acoustic artifacts. Moreover, those may occur for only particular phonemes or sounds. Here, we propose three algorithms that weigh likelihood-ratio scores of individual frames, phonemes, and sound-classes depending on their importance for the SSD. Significant improvement over the baseline system has been obtained for known attack methods that were used in training the SSDs. However, improvement with unknown attack types was not substantial. Thus, the type of distortions that were caused by the unknown systems were different and could not be captured better with the proposed SSD compared to the baseline SSD.

> Previous attacks that link the sender and receiver of traffic in the Tor network ("correlation attacks") have generally relied on analyzing traffic from TCP connections. The TCP connections of a typical client application, however, are often accompanied by DNS requests and responses. This additional traffic presents more opportunities for correlation attacks. This paper quantifies how DNS traffic can make Tor users more vulnerable to correlation attacks. We investigate how incorporating DNS traffic can make existing correlation attacks more powerful and how DNS lookups can leak information to third parties about anonymous communication. We (i) develop a method to identify the DNS resolvers of Tor exit relays; (ii) develop a new set of correlation attacks (DefecTor attacks) that incorporate DNS traffic to improve precision; (iii) analyze the Internet-scale effects of these new attacks on Tor users; and (iv) develop improved methods to evaluate correlation attacks. First, we find that there exist adversaries who can mount DefecTor attacks: for example, Google's DNS resolver observes almost 40% of all DNS requests exiting the Tor network. We also find that DNS requests often traverse ASes that the corresponding TCP connections do not transit, enabling additional ASes to gain information about Tor users' traffic. We then show that an adversary who can mount a DefecTor attack can often determine the website that a Tor user is visiting with perfect precision, particularly for less popular websites where the set of DNS names associated with that website may be unique to the site. We also use the Tor Path Simulator (TorPS) in combination with traceroute data from vantage points co-located with Tor exit relays to estimate the power of AS-level adversaries who might mount DefecTor attacks in practice.

> Today's Internet utilizes a multitude of different protocols. While some of these protocols were first implemented and used and later documented, other were first specified and then implemented. Regardless of how protocols came to be, their definitions can contain traps that lead to insecure implementations or deployments. A classical example is insufficiently strict authentication requirements in a protocol specification. The resulting Misconfigurations, i.e., not enabling strong authentication, are common root causes for Internet security incidents. Indeed, Internet protocols have been commonly designed without security in mind which leads to a multitude of misconfiguration traps. While this is slowly changing, to strict security considerations can have a similarly bad effect. Due to complex implementations and insufficient documentation, security features may remain unused, leaving deployments vulnerable.   In this paper we provide a systematization of the security traps found in common Internet protocols. By separating protocols in four classes we identify major factors that lead to common security traps. These insights together with observations about end-user centric usability and security by default are then used to derive recommendations for improving existing and designing new protocols---without such security sensitive traps for operators, implementors and users.

> Multicarrier phase-based ranging is fast emerging as a cost-optimized solution for a wide variety of proximity-based applications due to its low power requirement, low hardware complexity and compatibility with existing standards such as ZigBee and 6LoWPAN. Given potentially critical nature of the applications in which phase-based ranging can be deployed (e.g., access control, asset tracking), it is important to evaluate its security guarantees. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the security of multicarrier phase-based ranging systems and specifically focus on distance decreasing relay attacks that have proven detrimental to the security of proximity-based access control systems (e.g., vehicular passive keyless entry and start systems). We show that phase-based ranging, as well as its implementations, are vulnerable to a variety of distance reduction attacks. We describe different attack realizations and verify their feasibility by simulations and experiments on a commercial ranging system. Specifically, we successfully reduced the estimated range to less than 3 m even though the devices were more than 50 m apart. We discuss possible countermeasures against such attacks and illustrate their limitations, therefore demonstrating that phase-based ranging cannot be fully secured against distance decreasing attacks.

> More than a dozen wireless technologies are used by air traffic communication systems during different flight phases. From a conceptual perspective, all of them are insecure as security was never part of their design. Recent contributions from academic and hacking communities have exploited this inherent vulnerability to demonstrate attacks on some of these technologies. However, not all of these contributions have resonated widely within aviation circles. At the same time, the security community lacks certain aviation domain knowledge, preventing aviation authorities from giving credence to their findings.   In this paper, we aim to reconcile the view of the security community and the perspective of aviation professionals concerning the safety of air traffic communication technologies. To achieve this, we first provide a systematization of the applications of wireless technologies upon which civil aviation relies. Based on these applications, we comprehensively analyze vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures. We categorize the existing research on countermeasures into approaches that are applicable in the short term and research of secure new technologies deployable in the long term.   Since not all of the required aviation knowledge is codified in academic publications, we additionally examine existing aviation standards and survey 242 international aviation experts. Besides their domain knowledge, we also analyze the awareness of members of the aviation community concerning the security of wireless systems and collect their expert opinions on the potential impact of concrete attack scenarios using these technologies.

> Embedded systems permeate through nearly all aspects of modern society. From cars to refrigerators to nuclear refineries, securing these systems has never been more important. Intrusions, such as the Stuxnet malware which broke the centrifuges in Iran's Natanz refinery, can be catastrophic to not only the infected systems, but even to the wellbeing of the surrounding population. Modern day protection mechanisms for these embedded systems generally look only at protecting the network layer, and those that try to discover malware already existing on a system typically aren't efficient enough to run on a standalone embedded system. As such, we present a novel way to ensure that no malware has been inserted into an embedded system. We chaotically randomize the entire memory space of the application, interspersing watchdog-monitor programs throughout, to monitor that the core application hasn't been infiltrated. By validating the original program through conventional methods and creating a clean reset, we can ensure that any inserted malware is purged from the system with minimal effect on the given system. We also present a software prototype to validate the possibility of this approach, but given the limitations and vulnerabilities of the prototype, we also suggest a hardware alternative to the system.

> Android Framework is a layer of software that exists in every Android system managing resources of all Android apps. A vulnerability in Android Framework can lead to severe hacks, such as destroying user data and leaking private information. With tens of millions of Android devices unpatched due to Android fragmentation, vulnerabilities in Android Framework certainly attract attackers to exploit them. So far, enormous manual effort is needed to craft such exploits. To our knowledge, no research has been done on automatic generation of exploits that take advantage of Android Framework vulnerabilities. We make a first step towards this goal by applying symbolic execution of Android Framework to finding bugs and generating exploits. Several challenges have been raised by the task. (1) The information of an app flows to Android Framework in multiple intricate steps, making it difficult to identify symbolic inputs. (2) Android Framework has a complex initialization phase, which exacerbates the state space explosion problem. (3) A straightforward design that builds the symbolic executor as a layer inside the Android system will not work well: not only does the implementation have to ensure the compatibility with the Android system, but it needs to be maintained whenever Android gets updated. We present novel ideas and techniques to resolve the challenges, and have built the first system for symbolic execution of Android Framework. It fundamentally changes the state of the art in exploit generation on the Android system, and has been applied to constructing new techniques for finding vulnerabilities.

> Attack graphs are a powerful tool for security risk assessment by analysing network vulnerabilities and the paths attackers can use to compromise network resources. The uncertainty about the attacker's behaviour makes Bayesian networks suitable to model attack graphs to perform static and dynamic analysis. Previous approaches have focused on the formalization of attack graphs into a Bayesian model rather than proposing mechanisms for their analysis. In this paper we propose to use efficient algorithms to make exact inference in Bayesian attack graphs, enabling the static and dynamic network risk assessments. To support the validity of our approach we have performed an extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with different topologies, showing the computational advantages in terms of time and memory use of the proposed techniques when compared to existing approaches.

> Current tools and systems of detecting vulnerabilities simply alert the administrator of attempted attacks against his network or system. However, generally, the huge number of alerts to analyze and the amount time required to update security rules after analyzing alerts provides time and opportunity for the attacker to inflict damages. Moreover, most of these tools generate positive and negative falses, which may be important to the attacked network. Otherwise, many solutions exist such as IPS, but it shows a great defect due, fundamentally, to false positives. Indeed, attackers often make IPS block a legitimate traffic when they detect its presence in the attacked network. In this paper we describe an automated algorithm that gives the ability to detect attacks before they occurrence, then reduce positive and negative falses rates. Moreover, we use a set of data related to malicious traffic captured using a network of honeypots to recognize potential threats sources.

> Advances in machine learning (ML) in recent years have enabled a dizzying array of applications such as data analytics, autonomous systems, and security diagnostics. ML is now pervasive---new systems and models are being deployed in every domain imaginable, leading to rapid and widespread deployment of software based inference and decision making. There is growing recognition that ML exposes new vulnerabilities in software systems, yet the technical community's understanding of the nature and extent of these vulnerabilities remains limited. We systematize recent findings on ML security and privacy, focusing on attacks identified on these systems and defenses crafted to date. We articulate a comprehensive threat model for ML, and categorize attacks and defenses within an adversarial framework. Key insights resulting from works both in the ML and security communities are identified and the effectiveness of approaches are related to structural elements of ML algorithms and the data used to train them. We conclude by formally exploring the opposing relationship between model accuracy and resilience to adversarial manipulation. Through these explorations, we show that there are (possibly unavoidable) tensions between model complexity, accuracy, and resilience that must be calibrated for the environments in which they will be used.

> Recommendation systems have been widely used by commercial service providers for giving suggestions to users. Collaborative filtering (CF) systems, one of the most popular recommendation systems, utilize the history of behaviors of the aggregate user-base to provide individual recommendations and are effective when almost all users faithfully express their opinions. However, they are vulnerable to malicious users biasing their inputs in order to change the overall ratings of a specific group of items. CF systems largely fall into two categories - neighborhood-based and (matrix) factorization-based - and the presence of adversarial input can influence recommendations in both categories, leading to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Although the robustness of different collaborative filtering algorithms has been extensively studied, designing an efficient system that is immune to manipulation remains a significant challenge. In this work we propose a novel "hybrid" recommendation system with an adaptive graph-based user/item similarity-regularization - "Chiron". Chiron ties the performance benefits of dimensionality reduction (through factorization) with the advantage of neighborhood clustering (through regularization). We demonstrate, using extensive comparative experiments, that Chiron is resistant to manipulation by large and lethal attacks.

> Critically ill patients in regular wards are vulnerable to unanticipated clinical dete- rioration which requires timely transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). To allow for risk scoring and patient monitoring in such a setting, we develop a novel Semi- Markov Switching Linear Gaussian Model (SSLGM) for the inpatients' physiol- ogy. The model captures the patients' latent clinical states and their corresponding observable lab tests and vital signs. We present an efficient unsupervised learn- ing algorithm that capitalizes on the informatively censored data in the electronic health records (EHR) to learn the parameters of the SSLGM; the learned model is then used to assess the new inpatients' risk for clinical deterioration in an online fashion, allowing for timely ICU admission. Experiments conducted on a het- erogeneous cohort of 6,094 patients admitted to a large academic medical center show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the currently deployed risk scores such as Rothman index, MEWS, SOFA and APACHE.

> The present complexity in designing web applications makes software security a difficult goal to achieve. An attacker can explore a deployed service on the web and attack at his/her own leisure. Moving Target Defense (MTD) in web applications is an effective mechanism to nullify this advantage of their reconnaissance but the framework demands a good switching strategy when switching between multiple configurations for its web-stack. To address this issue, we propose modeling of a real-world MTD web application as a repeated Bayesian game. We then formulate an optimization problem that generates an effective switching strategy while considering the cost of switching between different web-stack configurations. To incorporate this model into a developed MTD system, we develop an automated system for generating attack sets of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for input attacker types with predefined capabilities. Our framework obtains realistic reward values for the players (defenders and attackers) in this game by using security domain expertise on CVEs obtained from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We also address the issue of prioritizing vulnerabilities that when fixed, improves the security of the MTD system. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our proposed model by evaluating its performance when there is uncertainty about input attacker information.

An error resistant algorithm is later described. It employs several threshold preprocessing stages followed by a combined approach of least mean squares and an optimized Hamming mask search. Further analysis of 32 and 64-bit Twofish implementations reveals that they are similarly vulnerable to the described SPA attack.

> Qualifying and ranking threat degrees of vulnerabilities in cloud service are known to be full of challenges. Although there have been several efforts aiming to address this problem, most of them are too simple or cannot be applied into cloud infrastructure. This paper aims to propose a novel framework to qualify and rank the vulnerabilities based on their threat degrees in cloud service. Through inputting or constructing service dependency graph, our framework is able to generate the importance degree of each service and the ranking list of all the vulnerabilities in cloud service. Moreover, our framework can be adopted not only into various cloud infrastructures, but also different categories of algorithms according to concrete requirements. To evaluate our framework, we adopt AssetRank algorithm into the framework, and present the whole design of our work. Comprehensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our framework on qualifying and ranking vulnerabilities in cloud service.

<summary>2016-12-07 09:00:11 - A Non-Intrusive and Context-Based Vulnerability Scoring Framework for Cloud Services</summary>

- *Hao Zhuang, Florian Pydde*

- `1611.07383v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07383v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07383v2)

> Understanding the severity of vulnerabilities within cloud services is particularly important for today service administrators.Although many systems, e.g., CVSS, have been built to evaluate and score the severity of vulnerabilities for administrators, the scoring schemes employed by these systems fail to take into account the contextual information of specific services having these vulnerabilities, such as what roles they play in a particular service. Such a deficiency makes resulting scores unhelpful. This paper presents a practical framework, NCVS, that offers automatic and contextual scoring mechanism to evaluate the severity of vulnerabilities for a particular service. Specifically, for a given service S, NCVS first automatically collects S contextual information including topology, configurations, vulnerabilities and their dependencies. Then, NCVS uses the collected information to build a contextual dependency graph, named CDG, to model S context. Finally, NCVS scores and ranks all the vulnerabilities in S by analyzing S context, such as what roles the vulnerabilities play in S, and how critical they affect the functionality of S. NCVS is novel and useful, because 1) context-based vulnerability scoring results are highly relevant and meaningful for administrators to understand each vulnerability importance specific to the target service; and 2) the workflow of NCVS does not need instrumentation or modifications to any source code. Our experimental results demonstrate that NCVS can obtain more relevant vulnerability scoring results than comparable system, such as CVSS.

<summary>2016-12-07 12:19:41 - CAn't Touch This: Practical and Generic Software-only Defenses Against Rowhammer Attacks</summary>

- *Ferdinand Brasser, Lucas Davi, David Gens, Christopher Liebchen, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi*

- `1611.08396v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08396v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08396v2)

> Rowhammer is a hardware bug that can be exploited to implement privilege escalation and remote code execution attacks. Previous proposals on rowhammer mitigation either require hardware changes or follow heuristic-based approaches (based on CPU performance counters). To date, there exists no instant protection against rowhammer attacks on legacy systems.   In this paper, we present the design and implementation of two practical and efficient software-only defenses against rowhammer attacks. Our defenses prevent the attacker from leveraging rowhammer to corrupt physically co-located data in memory that is owned by a different system entity. Our first defense, B-CATT, extends the system bootloader to disable vulnerable physical memory. B-CATT is highly practical, does not require changes to the operating system, and can be deployed on virtually all x86-based systems. While B-CATT is able to stop all known rowhammer attacks, it does not yet tackle the fundamental problem of missing memory isolation in physical memory. To address this problem, we introduce our second defense G-CATT, a generic solution that extends the physical memory allocator of the OS to physically isolate the memory of different system entities (e.g., kernel and user space).   As proof of concept, we implemented B-CATT on x86, and our generic defense, G-CATT, on x86 and ARM to mitigate rowhammer-based kernel exploits. Our extensive evaluation shows that both mitigation schemes (i) can stop available real- world rowhammer attacks, (ii) impose virtually no run-time overhead for common user and kernel benchmarks as well as commonly used applications, and (iii) do not affect the stability of the overall system.

<summary>2016-12-07 16:13:52 - Extend natural neighbor: a novel classification method with self-adaptive neighborhood parameters in different stages</summary>

- *Ji Feng, Qingsheng Zhu, Jinlong Huang, Lijun Yang*

- `1612.02310v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02310v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02310v1)

> Various kinds of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) based classification methods are the bases of many well-established and high-performance pattern-recognition techniques, but both of them are vulnerable to their parameter choice. Essentially, the challenge is to detect the neighborhood of various data sets, while utterly ignorant of the data characteristic. This article introduces a new supervised classification method: the extend natural neighbor (ENaN) method, and shows that it provides a better classification result without choosing the neighborhood parameter artificially. Unlike the original KNN based method which needs a prior k, the ENaNE method predicts different k in different stages. Therefore, the ENaNE method is able to learn more from flexible neighbor information both in training stage and testing stage, and provide a better classification result.

> This study provides the first confirmation that individual employment status can be predicted from standard mobile phone network logs externally validated with household survey data. Individual welfare and households vulnerability to shocks are intimately connected to employment status and professions of household breadwinners. At a societal level unemployment is an important indicator of the performance of an economy. By deriving a broad set of novel mobile phone network indicators reflecting users financial, social and mobility patterns we show how machine learning models can be used to predict 18 categories of profession in a South-Asian developing country. The model predicts individual unemployment status with 70.4 percent accuracy. We further show how unemployment can be aggregated from individual level and mapped geographically at cell tower resolution, providing a promising approach to map labor market economic indicators, and the distribution of economic productivity and vulnerability between censuses, especially in heterogeneous urban areas. The method also provides a promising approach to support data collection on vulnerable populations, which are frequently under-represented in official surveys.

- `1611.04880v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04880v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04880v2)

> With the rapid growth of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), concerns about the security of IoT devices have become prominent. Several vendors are producing IP-connected devices for home and small office networks that often suffer from flawed security designs and implementations. They also tend to lack mechanisms for firmware updates or patches that can help eliminate security vulnerabilities. Securing networks where the presence of such vulnerable devices is given, requires a brownfield approach: applying necessary protection measures within the network so that potentially vulnerable devices can coexist without endangering the security of other devices in the same network. In this paper, we present IOT SENTINEL, a system capable of automatically identifying the types of devices being connected to an IoT network and enabling enforcement of rules for constraining the communications of vulnerable devices so as to minimize damage resulting from their compromise. We show that IOT SENTINEL is effective in identifying device types and has minimal performance overhead.

<summary>2016-12-15 12:30:03 - Estonian Voting Verification Mechanism Revisited</summary>

- *Koksal Mus, Mehmet Sabir Kiraz, Murat Cenk, Isa Sertkaya*

- `1612.00668v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00668v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00668v2)

> After the Estonian Parliamentary Elections held in 2011, an additional verification mechanism was integrated into the i-voting system in order to resist corrupted voting devices, including the so called Student's Attack where a student practically showed that the voting system is indeed not verifiable by developing several versions of malware capable of blocking or even changing the vote. This mechanism gives voters the opportunity to verify whether the vote they cast is stored in the central system correctly. However, the verification phase ends by displaying the cast vote in plain form on the verification device. In other words, the device on which the verification is done learns the voter's choice. In this work, our aim is to investigate this verification phase in detail and to point out that leaking the voter's choice to the verification application may harm the voter privacy. Additionally, when applied in a wide range, this would even compromise the fairness and the overall secrecy of the elections. In this respect, we propose an alternative verification mechanism for the Estonian i-voting system to overcome this vulnerability. Not only is the proposed mechanism secure and resistant against corrupted verification devices, so does it successfully verify whether the vote is correctly stored in the system. We also highlight that our proposed mechanism brings only symmetric encryptions and hash functions on the verification device, thereby mitigating these weaknesses in an efficient way with a negligible cost. More concretely, it brings only $m$ additional symmetric key decryptions to the verification device, where $m$ denoting the number of candidates. Finally, we prove the security of the proposed verification mechanism and compare the cost complexity of the proposed method with that of the current mechanism.

> Despite its widespread use in Android apps, reflection poses graving problems for static security analysis. Currently, string inference is applied to handle reflection, resulting in significantly missed security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we bring forward the ubiquity of incomplete information environments (IIEs) for Android apps, where some critical data-flows are missing during static analysis, and the need for resolving reflective calls under IIEs. We present Ripple, the first IIE-aware static reflection analysis for Android apps that resolves reflective calls more soundly than string inference. Validation with 17 popular Android apps from Google Play demonstrates the effectiveness of Ripple in discovering reflective targets with a low false positive rate. As a result, Ripple enables FlowDroid, a taint analysis for Android apps, to find hundreds of sensitive data leakages that would otherwise be missed. As a fundamental analysis, Ripple will be valuable for many security analysis clients, since more program behaviors can now be analyzed under IIEs.

- *Nina Narodytska, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan*

- `1612.06299v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06299v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06299v1)

> Deep neural networks are powerful and popular learning models that achieve state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance on many computer vision, speech, and language processing tasks. However, these networks have also been shown susceptible to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations which force misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world.   In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be observed on the probed inputs. Our first attack is based on a simple idea of adding perturbation to a randomly selected single pixel or a small set of them. We then improve the effectiveness of this attack by carefully constructing a small set of pixels to perturb by using the idea of greedy local-search. Our proposed attacks also naturally extend to a stronger notion of misclassification. Our extensive experimental results illustrate that even these elementary attacks can reveal a deep neural network's vulnerabilities. The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could serve as a litmus test for designing robust networks.

It provides the statistical analytics about various attacks and nature of attacks for acquiring the results through simulation to prove the hypothesis.

> Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is consisting of independent and distributed sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc. However, the limited resources of sensors and hostile environments in which they could be deployed, make this type of networks vulnerable to several types of attacks similar to those occurring in ad hoc networks. The most crucial and fundamental challenge that WSN is facing is security. The primary subject of all my work is to address this issue. Due to minimum capacity in term of memory cost, processing and physical accessibility to sensors devices the security attacks are problematic. They are mostly deployed in open area so are more exposed to different kinds of attacks. They must be designed in a way to successfully recover itself from different kinds of attacks. In this paper, we proposed a new lightweight cryptography algorithm based on LEAP+. Our evaluations on TOSSIM give a precise and detailed idea of the extra cost of consumption of resources needed to ensure the high level of expected security.
