- `2501.00684v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00684v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00684v1)

> Solving arithmetic tasks is a simple and fundamental skill, yet modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have great difficulty with them. We introduce the Integrated Gated Calculator (IGC), a module that enables LLMs to perform arithmetic by emulating a calculator on the GPU. We finetune a Llama model with our module and test it on the BigBench Arithmetic benchmark, where it beats the State of the Art, outperforming all models on the benchmark, including models almost two orders of magnitude larger. Our approach takes only a single iteration to run and requires no external tools. It performs arithmetic operations entirely inside the LLM without the need to produce intermediate tokens. It is computationally efficient, interpretable, and avoids side-effects on tasks that do not require arithmetic operations. It reliably achieves 98\% to 99\% accuracy across multiple training runs and for all subtasks, including the substantially harder subtask of multiplication, which was previously unsolved.

<summary>2025-01-01 00:03:24 - OMuleT: Orchestrating Multiple Tools for Practicable Conversational Recommendation</summary>

- *Se-eun Yoon, Xiaokai Wei, Yexi Jiang, Rachit Pareek, Frank Ong, Kevin Gao, Julian McAuley, Michelle Gong*

- `2411.19352v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19352v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19352v2)

> In this paper, we present a systematic effort to design, evaluate, and implement a realistic conversational recommender system (CRS). The objective of our system is to allow users to input free-form text to request recommendations, and then receive a list of relevant and diverse items. While previous work on synthetic queries augments large language models (LLMs) with 1-3 tools, we argue that a more extensive toolbox is necessary to effectively handle real user requests. As such, we propose a novel approach that equips LLMs with over 10 tools, providing them access to the internal knowledge base and API calls used in production. We evaluate our model on a dataset of real users and show that it generates relevant, novel, and diverse recommendations compared to vanilla LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the full range of tools in our toolbox. We share our designs and lessons learned from deploying the system for internal alpha release. Our contribution is the addressing of all four key aspects of a practicable CRS: (1) real user requests, (2) augmenting LLMs with a wide variety of tools, (3) extensive evaluation, and (4) deployment insights.

<summary>2025-01-01 00:35:53 - Intelligent Approaches to Predictive Analytics in Occupational Health and Safety in India</summary>

- *Ritwik Raj Saxena*

- `2412.16038v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16038v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16038v3)

> Concerns associated with occupational health and safety (OHS) remain critical and often under-addressed aspects of workforce management. This is especially true for high-risk industries such as manufacturing, construction, and mining. Such industries dominate the economy of India which is a developing country with a vast informal sector. Regulatory frameworks have been strengthened over the decades, particularly with regards to bringing the unorganized sector within the purview of law. Traditional approaches to OHS have largely been reactive and rely on post-incident analysis (which is curative) rather than preventive intervention. This paper portrays the immense potential of predictive analytics in rejuvenating OHS practices in India. Intelligent predictive analytics is driven by approaches like machine learning and statistical modeling. Its data-driven nature serves to overcome the limitations of conventional OHS methods. Predictive analytics approaches to OHS in India draw on global case studies and generative applications of predictive analytics in OHS which are customized to Indian industrial contexts. This paper attempts to explore in what ways it exhibits the potential to address challenges such as fragmented data ecosystems, resource constraints, and the variability of workplace hazards. The paper presents actionable policy recommendations to create conditions conducive to the widespread implementation of predictive analytics, which must be advocated as a cornerstone of OHS strategy. In doing so, the paper aims to spark a collaborational dialogue among policymakers, industry leaders, and technologists. It urges a shift towards intelligent practices to safeguard the well-being of India's workforce.

- *Carlos Misael Madrid Padilla, Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla, Yik Lun Kei, Zhi Zhang, Yanzhen Chen*

- `2412.20355v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20355v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20355v2)

> This paper addresses the problems of conditional variance estimation and confidence interval construction in nonparametric regression using dense networks with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. We present a residual-based framework for conditional variance estimation, deriving nonasymptotic bounds for variance estimation under both heteroscedastic and homoscedastic settings. We relax the sub-Gaussian noise assumption, allowing the proposed bounds to accommodate sub-Exponential noise and beyond. Building on this, for a ReLU neural network estimator, we derive non-asymptotic bounds for both its conditional mean and variance estimation, representing the first result for variance estimation using ReLU networks. Furthermore, we develop a ReLU network based robust bootstrap procedure (Efron, 1992) for constructing confidence intervals for the true mean that comes with a theoretical guarantee on the coverage, providing a significant advancement in uncertainty quantification and the construction of reliable confidence intervals in deep learning settings.

<summary>2025-01-01 01:06:58 - Labels Generated by Large Language Model Helps Measuring People's Empathy in Vitro</summary>

- *Md Rakibul Hasan, Yue Yao, Md Zakir Hossain, Aneesh Krishna, Imre Rudas, Shafin Rahman, Tom Gedeon*

- `2501.00691v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00691v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00691v1)

> Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised numerous fields, with LLM-as-a-service (LLMSaaS) having a strong generalisation ability that offers accessible solutions directly without the need for costly training. In contrast to the widely studied prompt engineering for task solving directly (in vivo), this paper explores its potential in in-vitro applications. These involve using LLM to generate labels to help the supervised training of mainstream models by (1) noisy label correction and (2) training data augmentation with LLM-generated labels. In this paper, we evaluate this approach in the emerging field of empathy computing -- automating the prediction of psychological questionnaire outcomes from inputs like text sequences. Specifically, crowdsourced datasets in this domain often suffer from noisy labels that misrepresent underlying empathy. By leveraging LLM-generated labels to train pre-trained language models (PLMs) like RoBERTa, we achieve statistically significant accuracy improvements over baselines, achieving a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on NewsEmp benchmarks. In addition, we bring insightful discussions, including current challenges in empathy computing, data biases in training data and evaluation metric selection. Code and LLM-generated data are available at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/LLMPathy (available once the paper is accepted).

<summary>2025-01-01 01:10:59 - Adjoint sharding for very long context training of state space models</summary>

- *Xingzi Xu, Amir Tavanaei, Kavosh Asadi, Karim Bouyarmane*

- `2501.00692v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00692v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00692v1)

> Despite very fast progress, efficiently training large language models (LLMs) in very long contexts remains challenging. Existing methods fall back to training LLMs with short contexts (a maximum of a few thousands tokens in training) and use inference time techniques when evaluating on long contexts (above 1M tokens context window at inference). As opposed to long-context-inference, training on very long context input prompts is quickly limited by GPU memory availability and by the prohibitively long training times it requires on state-of-the-art hardware. Meanwhile, many real-life applications require not only inference but also training/fine-tuning with long context on specific tasks. Such applications include, for example, augmenting the context with various sources of raw reference information for fact extraction, fact summarization, or fact reconciliation tasks. We propose adjoint sharding, a novel technique that comprises sharding gradient calculation during training to reduce memory requirements by orders of magnitude, making training on very long context computationally tractable. Adjoint sharding is based on the adjoint method and computes equivalent gradients to backpropagation. We also propose truncated adjoint sharding to speed up the algorithm while maintaining performance. We provide a distributed version, and a paralleled version of adjoint sharding to further speed up training. Empirical results show the proposed adjoint sharding algorithm reduces memory usage by up to 3X with a 1.27B parameter large language model on 1M context length training. This allows to increase the maximum context length during training or fine-tuning of a 1.27B parameter model from 35K tokens to above 100K tokens on a training infrastructure composed of five AWS P4 instances.

<summary>2025-01-01 01:11:16 - Beyond Model Scale Limits: End-Edge-Cloud Federated Learning with Self-Rectified Knowledge Agglomeration</summary>

- *Zhiyuan Wu, Sheng Sun, Yuwei Wang, Min Liu, Ke Xu, Quyang Pan, Bo Gao, Tian Wen*

- `2501.00693v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00693v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00693v1)

> The rise of End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration (EECC) offers a promising paradigm for Artificial Intelligence (AI) model training across end devices, edge servers, and cloud data centers, providing enhanced reliability and reduced latency. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) can benefit from this paradigm by enabling multi-tier model aggregation across distributed computing nodes. However, the potential of HFL is significantly constrained by the inherent heterogeneity and dynamic characteristics of EECC environments. Specifically, the uniform model structure bounded by the least powerful end device across all computing nodes imposes a performance bottleneck. Meanwhile, coupled heterogeneity in data distributions and resource capabilities across tiers disrupts hierarchical knowledge transfer, leading to biased updates and degraded performance. Furthermore, the mobility and fluctuating connectivity of computing nodes in EECC environments introduce complexities in dynamic node migration, further compromising the robustness of the training process. To address multiple challenges within a unified framework, we propose End-Edge-Cloud Federated Learning with Self-Rectified Knowledge Agglomeration (FedEEC), which is a novel EECC-empowered FL framework that allows the trained models from end, edge, to cloud to grow larger in size and stronger in generalization ability. FedEEC introduces two key innovations: (1) Bridge Sample Based Online Distillation Protocol (BSBODP), which enables knowledge transfer between neighboring nodes through generated bridge samples, and (2) Self-Knowledge Rectification (SKR), which refines the transferred knowledge to prevent suboptimal cloud model optimization. The proposed framework effectively handles both cross-tier resource heterogeneity and effective knowledge transfer between neighboring nodes, while satisfying the migration-resilient requirements of EECC.

- *Chethan Bhateja, Joseph O'Brien, Afnaan Hashmi, Eva Prakash*

- `2501.00696v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00696v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00696v1)

> In machine learning, metric elicitation refers to the selection of performance metrics that best reflect an individual's implicit preferences for a given application. Currently, metric elicitation methods only consider metrics that depend on the accuracy values encoded within a given model's confusion matrix. However, focusing solely on confusion matrices does not account for other model feasibility considerations such as varied monetary costs or latencies. In our work, we build upon the multiclass metric elicitation framework of Hiranandani et al., extrapolating their proposed Diagonal Linear Performance Metric Elicitation (DLPME) algorithm to account for additional bounded costs and rewards. Our experimental results with synthetic data demonstrate our approach's ability to quickly converge to the true metric.

<summary>2025-01-01 01:45:01 - TOTEM: TOkenized Time Series EMbeddings for General Time Series Analysis</summary>

- *Sabera Talukder, Yisong Yue, Georgia Gkioxari*

- `2402.16412v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16412v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16412v2)

> This work studies the problem of time series analysis with generalist (or foundation) models, which are models trained across many data domains. Drawing inspiration from the widespread success of large language models, we consider the simple strategy of discretely tokenizing time series data drawn from a myriad of datasets via self-supervision, then using the fixed tokenization to solve a variety of tasks across many data domains. Canonically, time series models are either trained on a single dataset or built in a task-specific manner (e.g., a forecasting-only model), where many use patches of time as inputs to the model. As such, performant generalist, discrete representation time series models explored across many tasks are of value. Our method, TOkenized Time Series EMbeddings (TOTEM), produces such generalist time series models with minimal or no fine-tuning while exhibiting strong zero-shot performance. We evaluate TOTEM extensively over nearly 500 experiments on three commonly-studied time series tasks with real-world data: imputation (17 baselines, 12 datasets), anomaly detection (19 baselines, 25 datasets), and forecasting (14 baselines, 12 datasets). We conclude that TOTEM matches or outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both the canonical specialist setting (i.e., training one model on one domain) as well as the generalist setting (i.e., training a single model on many domains), which demonstrates the efficacy of tokenization for general time series analysis.

<summary>2025-01-01 02:19:42 - NN-ResDMD: Learning Koopman Representations for Complex Dynamics with Spectral Residuals</summary>

- *Yuanchao Xu, Kaidi Shao, Nikos Logothetis, Zhongwei Shen*

- `2501.00701v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00701v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00701v1)

> Analyzing long-term behaviors in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems remains a significant challenge. The Koopman operator framework has emerged as a powerful tool to address this issue by providing a globally linear perspective on nonlinear dynamics. However, existing methods for approximating the Koopman operator and its spectral components, particularly in large-scale systems, often lack robust theoretical guarantees. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) introduces a spectral residual measure to assess the convergence of the estimated Koopman spectrum, which helps filter out spurious spectral components. Nevertheless, it depends on pre-computed spectra, thereby inheriting their inaccuracies. To overcome its limitations, we introduce the Neural Network-ResDMD (NN-ResDMD), a method that directly estimates Koopman spectral components by minimizing the spectral residual. By leveraging neural networks, NN-ResDMD automatically identifies the optimal basis functions of the Koopman invariant subspace, eliminating the need for manual selection and improving the reliability of the analysis. Experiments on physical and biological systems demonstrate that NN-ResDMD significantly improves both accuracy and scalability, making it an effective tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems.

<summary>2025-01-01 02:46:00 - Kolmogorov GAM Networks are all you need!</summary>

> Kolmogorov GAM (K-GAM) networks are shown to be an efficient architecture for training and inference. They are an additive model with an embedding that is independent of the function of interest. They provide an alternative to the transformer architecture. They are the machine learning version of Kolmogorov's Superposition Theorem (KST) which provides an efficient representations of a multivariate function. Such representations have use in machine learning for encoding dictionaries (a.k.a. "look-up" tables). KST theory also provides a representation based on translates of the K\"oppen function. The goal of our paper is to interpret this representation in a machine learning context for applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our architecture is equivalent to a topological embedding which is independent of the function together with an additive layer that uses a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). This provides a class of learning procedures with far fewer parameters than current deep learning algorithms. Implementation can be parallelizable which makes our algorithms computationally attractive. To illustrate our methodology, we use the Iris data from statistical learning. We also show that our additive model with non-linear embedding provides an alternative to transformer architectures which from a statistical viewpoint are kernel smoothers. Additive KAN models therefore provide a natural alternative to transformers. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.

> Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.

> Graph Representation Learning aims to create embeddings for nodes and edges, capturing their features and interconnections. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have excelled in this task, leveraging neural networks to model complex graph relationships. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) emerged as an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), showing improved accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. While KANs have been integrated into unsigned GNNs, their application in signed GNNs remains unexplored. This paper integrates KAN into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs) to evaluate its performance on signed graphs where edges have positive or negative signs. We empirically assess KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN) on downstream tasks such as signed community detection and link sign prediction to enhance the embedding quality in signed networks. Considering the variability in the results indicated by the relatively large standard deviation, KASGCN demonstrates competitive performance with, or similar to, the vanilla SGCN in the evaluated downstream tasks, and its effectiveness is context-dependent (signed graph and parameters...etc.).

> Artificial intelligence-based language generators are now a part of most people's lives. However, by default, they tend to generate "average" language without reflecting the ways in which people differ. Here, we propose a lightweight modification to the standard language model transformer architecture - "PsychAdapter" - that uses empirically derived trait-language patterns to generate natural language for specified personality, demographic, and mental health characteristics (with or without prompting). We applied PsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and found generated text to reflect the desired traits. For example, expert raters evaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended trait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7% for depression and life satisfaction. PsychAdapter is a novel method to introduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the foundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer layer. This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles, clinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological conditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or education level without taking up LLM context windows. PsychAdapter also allows for the exploration psychological constructs through natural language expression, extending the natural language processing toolkit to study human psychology.

- `2501.00712v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00712v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00712v1)

> Transformers rely on both content-based and position-based addressing mechanisms to make predictions, but existing positional encoding techniques often diminish the effectiveness of position-based addressing. Many current methods enforce rigid patterns in attention maps, limiting the ability to model long-range dependencies and adapt to diverse tasks. Additionally, most positional encodings are learned as general biases, lacking the specialization required for different instances within a dataset. To address this, we propose con$\textbf{T}$extualized equivari$\textbf{A}$nt $\textbf{P}$osition $\textbf{E}$mbedding ($\textbf{TAPE}$), a novel framework that enhances positional embeddings by incorporating sequence content across layers. TAPE introduces dynamic, context-aware positional encodings, overcoming the constraints of traditional fixed patterns. By enforcing permutation and orthogonal equivariance, TAPE ensures the stability of positional encodings during updates, improving robustness and adaptability. Our method can be easily integrated into pre-trained transformers, offering parameter-efficient fine-tuning with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments shows that TAPE achieves superior performance in language modeling, arithmetic reasoning, and long-context retrieval tasks compared to existing positional embedding techniques.

> Stable Diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating photorealistic images from text prompts but often falter when tasked with accurately representing complex spatial arrangements, particularly involving intricate 3D relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce SmartSpatial, an innovative approach that enhances the spatial arrangement capabilities of Stable Diffusion models through 3D-aware conditioning and attention-guided mechanisms. SmartSpatial incorporates depth information and employs cross-attention control to ensure precise object placement, delivering notable improvements in spatial accuracy metrics. In conjunction with SmartSpatial, we present SmartSpatialEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess spatial relationships. This framework utilizes vision-language models and graph-based dependency parsing for performance analysis. Experimental results on the COCO and SpatialPrompts datasets show that SmartSpatial significantly outperforms existing methods, setting new benchmarks for spatial arrangement accuracy in image generation.

- *Tetsuya Hoya, Shunpei Morita*

- `2501.00725v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00725v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00725v1)

> This paper proposes a novel approach to pattern classification using a probabilistic neural network model. The strategy is based on a compact-sized probabilistic neural network capable of continuous incremental learning and unlearning tasks. The network is constructed/reconstructed using a simple, one-pass network-growing algorithm with no hyperparameter tuning. Then, given the training dataset, its structure and parameters are automatically determined and can be dynamically varied in continual incremental and decremental learning situations. The algorithm proposed in this work involves no iterative or arduous matrix-based parameter approximations but a simple data-driven updating scheme. Simulation results using nine publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing that compact-sized probabilistic neural networks constructed have a much smaller number of hidden units compared to the original probabilistic neural network model and yet can achieve a similar classification performance to that of multilayer perceptron neural networks in standard classification tasks, while also exhibiting sufficient capability in continuous class incremental learning and unlearning tasks.

<summary>2025-01-01 05:05:46 - Enhancing Unsupervised Feature Selection via Double Sparsity Constrained Optimization</summary>

- *Xianchao Xiu, Anning Yang, Chenyi Huang, Xinrong Li, Wanquan Liu*

- `2501.00726v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00726v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00726v1)

> Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is widely applied in machine learning and pattern recognition. However, most of the existing methods only consider a single sparsity, which makes it difficult to select valuable and discriminative feature subsets from the original high-dimensional feature set. In this paper, we propose a new UFS method called DSCOFS via embedding double sparsity constrained optimization into the classical principal component analysis (PCA) framework. Double sparsity refers to using $\ell_{2,0}$-norm and $\ell_0$-norm to simultaneously constrain variables, by adding the sparsity of different types, to achieve the purpose of improving the accuracy of identifying differential features. The core is that $\ell_{2,0}$-norm can remove irrelevant and redundant features, while $\ell_0$-norm can filter out irregular noisy features, thereby complementing $\ell_{2,0}$-norm to improve discrimination. An effective proximal alternating minimization method is proposed to solve the resulting nonconvex nonsmooth model. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the sequence generated by our method globally converges to a stationary point. Numerical experiments on three synthetic datasets and eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and convergence of the proposed method. In particular, the average clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) are improved by at least 3.34% and 3.02%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, two common statistical tests and a new feature similarity metric verify the advantages of double sparsity. All results suggest that our proposed DSCOFS provides a new perspective for feature selection.

- `2501.00733v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00733v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00733v1)

> This study explores the effectiveness of layer pruning for developing more efficient BERT models tailored to specific downstream tasks in low-resource languages. Our primary objective is to evaluate whether pruned BERT models can maintain high performance while reducing model size and complexity. We experiment with several BERT variants, including MahaBERT-v2 and Google-Muril, applying different pruning strategies and comparing their performance to smaller, scratch-trained models like MahaBERT-Small and MahaBERT-Smaller. We fine-tune these models on Marathi datasets, specifically Short Headlines Classification (SHC), Long Paragraph Classification (LPC) and Long Document Classification (LDC), to assess their classification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that pruned models, despite having fewer layers, achieve comparable performance to their fully-layered counterparts while consistently outperforming scratch-trained models of similar size. Notably, pruning layers from the middle of the model proves to be the most effective strategy, offering performance competitive with pruning from the top and bottom. However, there is no clear winner, as different pruning strategies perform better in different model and dataset combinations. Additionally, monolingual BERT models outperform multilingual ones in these experiments. This approach, which reduces computational demands, provides a faster and more efficient alternative to training smaller models from scratch, making advanced NLP models more accessible for low-resource languages without compromising classification accuracy.

Plant disease diagnosis presents a challenging classification task, characterized by its fine-grained nature, vague symptoms, and the extensive variability of image features within each domain. In this study, we propose the concept of Discriminative Difficulty Distance (DDD), a novel metric designed to quantify the domain gap between training and test datasets while assessing the classification difficulty of test data. DDD provides a valuable tool for identifying insufficient diversity in training data, thus supporting the development of more diverse and robust datasets. We investigated multiple image encoders trained on different datasets and examined whether the distances between datasets, measured using low-dimensional representations generated by the encoders, are suitable as a DDD metric. The study utilized 244,063 plant disease images spanning four crops and 34 disease classes collected from 27 domains. As a result, we demonstrated that even if the test images are from different crops or diseases than those used to train the encoder, incorporating them allows the construction of a distance measure for a dataset that strongly correlates with the difficulty of diagnosis indicated by the disease classifier developed independently. Compared to the base encoder, pre-trained only on ImageNet21K, the correlation higher by 0.106 to 0.485, reaching a maximum of 0.909.

> The multiscale and turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere has historically rendered accurate weather modeling a hard problem. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing various weather phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective weather models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension. Moreover, we develop an approach for handling terms that are not integrable-by-parts, such as advection operators.

> Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.

> Lip reading aims to predict spoken language by analyzing lip movements. Despite advancements in lip reading technologies, performance degrades when models are applied to unseen speakers due to their sensitivity to variations in visual information such as lip appearances. To address this challenge, speaker adaptive lip reading technologies have advanced by focusing on effectively adapting a lip reading model to target speakers in the visual modality. However, the effectiveness of adapting language information, such as vocabulary choice, of the target speaker has not been explored in previous works. Additionally, existing datasets for speaker adaptation have limited vocabulary sizes and pose variations, which restrict the validation of previous speaker-adaptive methods in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel speaker-adaptive lip reading method that adapts a pre-trained model to target speakers at both vision and language levels. Specifically, we integrate prompt tuning and the LoRA approach, applying them to a pre-trained lip reading model to effectively adapt the model to target speakers. Furthermore, to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a new dataset, VoxLRS-SA, derived from VoxCeleb2 and LRS3. It contains a vocabulary of approximately 100K words, offers diverse pose variations, and enables the validation of adaptation methods in the wild, sentence-level lip reading for the first time in English. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the existing speaker-adaptive method also improves performance in the wild at the sentence level. Moreover, we show that the proposed method achieves larger improvements compared to the previous works.

> To address the modality imbalance caused by data heterogeneity, existing multi-modal learning (MML) approaches primarily focus on balancing this difference from the perspective of optimization objectives. However, almost all existing methods ignore the impact of sample sequences, i.e., an inappropriate training order tends to trigger learning bias in the model, further exacerbating modality imbalance. In this paper, we propose Balance-aware Sequence Sampling (BSS) to enhance the robustness of MML. Specifically, we first define a multi-perspective measurer to evaluate the balance degree of each sample. Via the evaluation, we employ a heuristic scheduler based on curriculum learning (CL) that incrementally provides training subsets, progressing from balanced to imbalanced samples to rebalance MML. Moreover, considering that sample balance may evolve as the model capability increases, we propose a learning-based probabilistic sampling method to dynamically update the training sequences at the epoch level, further improving MML performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) MML approaches.

> Missing attribute issues are prevalent in the graph learning, leading to biased outcomes in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Existing methods that rely on feature propagation are prone to cold start problem, particularly when dealing with attribute resetting and low-degree nodes, which hinder effective propagation and convergence. To address these challenges, we propose AttriReBoost (ARB), a novel method that incorporates propagation-based method to mitigate cold start problems in attribute-missing graphs. ARB enhances global feature propagation by redefining initial boundary conditions and strategically integrating virtual edges, thereby improving node connectivity and ensuring more stable and efficient convergence. This method facilitates gradient-free attribute reconstruction with lower computational overhead. The proposed method is theoretically grounded, with its convergence rigorously established. Extensive experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ARB, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 5.11% over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ARB exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, processing a large-scale graph with 2.49 million nodes in just 16 seconds on a single GPU.

> Generative models are ubiquitous in modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Recent advances have led to a variety of generative modeling approaches that are capable of synthesizing highly realistic samples. Despite these developments, evaluating the distributional match between the synthetic samples and the target distribution in a statistically principled way remains a core challenge. We focus on evaluating image generative models, where studies often treat human evaluation as the gold standard. Commonly adopted metrics, such as the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), do not sufficiently capture the differences between the learned and target distributions, because the assumption of normality ignores differences in the tails. We propose the Embedded Characteristic Score (ECS), a comprehensive metric for evaluating the distributional match between the learned and target sample distributions, and explore its connection with moments and tail behavior. We derive natural properties of ECS and show its practical use via simulations and an empirical study.

> The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.

> This study proposes the design and implementation of a multimodal LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) leveraging a No-Code platform to address the practical constraints and significant entry barriers associated with AI adoption in enterprises. Advanced AI technologies, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), often pose challenges due to their technical complexity and high implementation costs, making them difficult for many organizations to adopt.

> The learner's ability to generate a hypothesis that closely approximates the target function is crucial in machine learning. Achieving this requires sufficient data; however, unauthorized access by an eavesdropping learner can lead to security risks. Thus, it is important to ensure the performance of the "authorized" learner by limiting the quality of the training data accessible to eavesdroppers. Unlike previous studies focusing on encryption or access controls, we provide a theorem to ensure superior learning outcomes exclusively for the authorized learner with quantum label encoding. In this context, we use the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) learning framework and introduce the concept of learning probability to quantitatively assess learner performance. Our theorem allows the condition that, given a training dataset, an authorized learner is guaranteed to achieve a certain quality of learning outcome, while eavesdroppers are not. Notably, this condition can be constructed based only on the authorized-learning-only measurable quantities of the training data, i.e., its size and noise degree. We validate our theoretical proofs and predictions through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) image classification learning.

<summary>2025-01-01 06:52:45 - An AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach for causal inference in observational studies</summary>

> Causal inference in observational studies with high-dimensional covariates presents significant challenges. We introduce CausalBGM, an AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach that captures the causal relationship among covariates, treatment, and outcome variables. The core innovation of CausalBGM lies in its ability to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) by learning individual-specific distributions of a low-dimensional latent feature set (e.g., latent confounders) that drives changes in both treatment and outcome. This approach not only effectively mitigates confounding effects but also provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification, offering reliable and interpretable causal effect estimates at the individual level. CausalBGM adopts a Bayesian model and uses a novel iterative algorithm to update the model parameters and the posterior distribution of latent features until convergence. This framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex dependencies among variables while adhering to the Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalBGM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and large-scale datasets. Its Bayesian foundation ensures statistical rigor, providing robust and well-calibrated posterior intervals. By addressing key limitations of existing methods, CausalBGM emerges as a robust and promising framework for advancing causal inference in modern applications in fields such as genomics, healthcare, and social sciences. CausalBGM is maintained at the website https://causalbgm.readthedocs.io/.

> For different factors/reasons, ranging from inherent characteristics and features providing decentralization, enhanced privacy, ease of transactions, etc., to implied external hardships in enforcing regulations, contradictions in data sharing policies, etc., cryptocurrencies have been severely abused for carrying out numerous malicious and illicit activities including money laundering, darknet transactions, scams, terrorism financing, arm trades. However, money laundering is a key crime to be mitigated to also suspend the movement of funds from other illicit activities. Billions of dollars are annually being laundered. It is getting extremely difficult to identify money laundering in crypto transactions owing to many layering strategies available today, and rapidly evolving tactics, and patterns the launderers use to obfuscate the illicit funds. Many detection methods have been proposed ranging from naive approaches involving complete manual investigation to machine learning models. However, there are very limited datasets available for effectively training machine learning models. Also, the existing datasets are static and class-imbalanced, posing challenges for scalability and suitability to specific scenarios, due to lack of customization to varying requirements. This has been a persistent challenge in literature. In this paper, we propose behavior embedded entity-specific money laundering-like transaction simulation that helps in generating various transaction types and models the transactions embedding the behavior of several entities observed in this space. The paper discusses the design and architecture of the simulator, a custom dataset we generated using the simulator, and the performance of models trained on this synthetic data in detecting real addresses involved in money laundering.

> This paper explores the key factors that influence the performance of models working with point clouds, across different tasks of varying geometric complexity. In this work, we explore the trade-offs between flexibility and weight-sharing introduced by equivariant layers, assessing when equivariance boosts or detracts from performance. It is often argued that providing more information as input improves a model's performance. However, if this additional information breaks certain properties, such as $\SE(3)$ equivariance, does it remain beneficial? We identify the key aspects of equivariant and non-equivariant architectures that drive success in different tasks by benchmarking them on segmentation, regression, and generation tasks across multiple datasets with increasing complexity. We observe a positive impact of equivariance, which becomes more pronounced with increasing task complexity, even when strict equivariance is not required.

> Transformers, as a fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning. This paper investigates the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and explores ways to improve it. The first-order reasoning capability of transformers is assessed through their ability to perform first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) the unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, enabling a characterization of fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset show that transformers outperform previous methods specifically designed for this task and provide detailed empirical evidence on the impact of input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our findings reveal a mismatch between positional encoding and other design choices in transformer architectures employed in prior practices. This discovery motivates us to propose a more sophisticated, logic-aware architecture, TEGA, to enhance the capability for generalizable first-order logical entailment in transformers.

> Although sign language recognition aids non-hearing-impaired understanding, many hearing-impaired individuals still rely on sign language alone due to limited literacy, underscoring the need for advanced sign language production and translation (SLP and SLT) systems. In the field of sign language production, the lack of adequate models and datasets restricts practical applications. Existing models face challenges in production accuracy and pose control, making it difficult to provide fluent sign language expressions across diverse scenarios. Additionally, data resources are scarce, particularly high-quality datasets with complete sign vocabulary and pose annotations. To address these issues, we introduce CNText2Sign and CNSign, comprehensive datasets to benchmark SLP and SLT, respectively, with CNText2Sign covering gloss and landmark mappings for SLP, and CNSign providing extensive video-to-text data for SLT. To improve the accuracy and applicability of sign language systems, we propose the AuraLLM and SignMST-C models. AuraLLM, incorporating LoRA and RAG techniques, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 50.41 on the CNText2Sign dataset, enabling precise control over gesture semantics and motion. SignMST-C employs self-supervised rapid motion video pretraining, achieving a BLEU-4 score of 31.03/32.08 on the PHOENIX2014-T benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art. These models establish robust baselines for the datasets released for their respective tasks.

> Prenatal ultrasound evaluates fetal growth and detects congenital abnormalities during pregnancy, but the examination of ultrasound images by radiologists requires expertise and sophisticated equipment, which would otherwise fail to improve the rate of identifying specific types of fetal central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities and result in unnecessary patient examinations. We construct a deep learning model to improve the overall accuracy of the diagnosis of fetal cranial anomalies to aid prenatal diagnosis. In our collected multi-center dataset of fetal craniocerebral anomalies covering four typical anomalies of the fetal central nervous system (CNS): anencephaly, encephalocele (including meningocele), holoprosencephaly, and rachischisis, patient-level prediction accuracy reaches 94.5%, with an AUROC value of 99.3%. In the subgroup analyzes, our model is applicable to the entire gestational period, with good identification of fetal anomaly types for any gestational period. Heatmaps superimposed on the ultrasound images not only provide a visual interpretation for the algorithm but also provide an intuitive visual aid to the physician by highlighting key areas that need to be reviewed, helping the physician to quickly identify and validate key areas. Finally, the retrospective reader study demonstrates that by combining the automatic prediction of the DL system with the professional judgment of the radiologist, the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency can be effectively improved and the misdiagnosis rate can be reduced, which has an important clinical application prospect.

> Graphs are essential data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.

> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be highly effective in boosting the generative performance of language model in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG framework either indiscriminately perform retrieval or rely on rigid single-class classifiers to select retrieval methods, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance across queries of varying complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy based on query complexity. % our solution Our approach leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm, which treats each retrieval method as a distinct ``arm'' and adapts the selection process by balancing exploration and exploitation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic reward function that balances accuracy and efficiency, penalizing methods that require more retrieval steps, even if they lead to a correct result. Our method achieves new state of the art results on multiple single-hop and multi-hop datasets while reducing retrieval costs. Our code are available at https://github.com/FUTUREEEEEE/MBA .

> Counterfactual examples are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) as valuable data to improve models, and in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand model behavior. The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals.

- `2501.00779v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00779v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00779v1)

> In social online platforms, identifying influential seed users to maximize influence spread is a crucial as it can greatly diminish the cost and efforts required for information dissemination. While effective, traditional methods for Multiplex Influence Maximization (MIM) have reached their performance limits, prompting the emergence of learning-based approaches. These novel methods aim for better generalization and scalability for more sizable graphs but face significant challenges, such as (1) inability to handle unknown diffusion patterns and (2) reliance on high-quality training samples. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced Expert Maximization framework (REM). REM leverages a Propagation Mixture of Experts technique to encode dynamic propagation of large multiplex networks effectively in order to generate enhanced influence propagation. Noticeably, REM treats a generative model as a policy to autonomously generate different seed sets and learn how to improve them from a Reinforcement Learning perspective. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that REM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of influence spread, scalability, and inference time in influence maximization tasks.

> This working paper explores the integration of neural networks onto resource-constrained embedded systems like a Raspberry Pi Pico / Raspberry Pi Pico 2. A TinyML aproach transfers neural networks directly on these microcontrollers, enabling real-time, low-latency, and energy-efficient inference while maintaining data privacy. Therefore, AI-ANNE: (A) (N)eural (N)et for (E)xploration will be presented, which facilitates the transfer of pre-trained models from high-performance platforms like TensorFlow and Keras onto microcontrollers, using a lightweight programming language like MicroPython.

> Post Quantum and Quantum Cryptography schemes are feasible quantum computer applications for 7G networks. These schemes could possibly replace existing schemes. These algorithms have been compromised by advances in quantum search algorithms run on quantum computers like Shor algorithm. Shor algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer which is the basis of existing algorithm. This has become an available quantum computer application putting the use of ESA algorithm at risk. Our recent paper provides a detailed survey of the work on post quantum and quantum cryptography algorithms with focus on their applicability in 7G networks.   Since the paper focuses on the cryptography algorithms as a follow up, in this paper, we provide a new framework for quantum network optimization and survey in detail the work on enabling technologies (quantum hardware) for the practical implementation of these algorithms including the most important segments of quantum hardware in 7G. As always in engineering practice practical solutions are a compromise between the performance and complexity of the implementation. For this reason, as the main contribution, the paper presents a network and computer applications optimization framework that includes implementation imperfections. The tools should be useful in optimizing future generation practical computer system design. After that a comprehensive survey of the existing work on quantum hardware is presented pointing out the sources of these imperfections. This enables us to make a fair assessment of how much investment into quantum hardware improvements contributes to the performance enhancement of the overall system. In this way a decision can be made on proper partitioning between the investment in hardware and system level complexity.

> Zero-shot event-relational reasoning is an important task in natural language processing, and existing methods jointly learn a variety of event-relational prefixes and inference-form prefixes to achieve such tasks. However, training prefixes consumes large computational resources and lacks interpretability. Additionally, learning various relational and inferential knowledge inefficiently exploits the connections between tasks. Therefore, we first propose a method for Reasoning-Oriented Locating and Editing (ROLE), which locates and edits the key modules of the language model for reasoning about event relations, enhancing interpretability and also resource-efficiently optimizing the reasoning ability. Subsequently, we propose a method for Analogy-Based Locating and Editing (ABLE), which efficiently exploits the similarities and differences between tasks to optimize the zero-shot reasoning capability. Experimental results show that ROLE improves interpretability and reasoning performance with reduced computational cost. ABLE achieves SOTA results in zero-shot reasoning.

> SimMIM is a widely used method for pretraining vision transformers using masked image modeling. However, despite its success in fine-tuning performance, it has been shown to perform sub-optimally when used for linear probing. We propose an efficient patch-wise weighting derived from keypoint features which captures the local information and provides better context during SimMIM's reconstruction phase. Our method, KAMIM, improves the top-1 linear probing accuracy from 16.12% to 33.97%, and finetuning accuracy from 76.78% to 77.3% when tested on the ImageNet-1K dataset with a ViT-B when trained for the same number of epochs. We conduct extensive testing on different datasets, keypoint extractors, and model architectures and observe that patch-wise weighting augments linear probing performance for larger pretraining datasets. We also analyze the learned representations of a ViT-B trained using KAMIM and observe that they behave similar to contrastive learning with regard to its behavior, with longer attention distances and homogenous self-attention across layers. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/madhava20217/KAMIM.

> Test-time adaptation aims to adapt pre-trained deep neural networks using solely online unlabelled test data during inference. Although TTA has shown promise in visual applications, its potential in time series contexts remains largely unexplored. Existing TTA methods, originally designed for visual tasks, may not effectively handle the complex temporal dynamics of real-world time series data, resulting in suboptimal adaptation performance. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Contrastive Clustering with Uncertainty-aware Prototyping (ACCUP), a straightforward yet effective TTA method for time series data. Initially, our approach employs augmentation ensemble on the time series data to capture diverse temporal information and variations, incorporating uncertainty-aware prototypes to distill essential characteristics. Additionally, we introduce an entropy comparison scheme to selectively acquire more confident predictions, enhancing the reliability of pseudo labels. Furthermore, we utilize augmented contrastive clustering to enhance feature discriminability and mitigate error accumulation from noisy pseudo labels, promoting cohesive clustering within the same class while facilitating clear separation between different classes. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world time series datasets and an additional visual dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization potential of the proposed method, advancing the underexplored realm of TTA for time series data.

> The use of beauty filters on social media, which enhance the appearance of individuals in images, is a well-researched area, with existing methods proving to be highly effective. Traditionally, such enhancements are performed using rule-based approaches that leverage domain knowledge of facial features associated with attractiveness, applying very specific transformations to maximize these attributes. In this work, we present an alternative approach that projects facial images as points on the latent space of a pre-trained GAN, which are then optimized to produce beautiful faces. The movement of the latent points is guided by a newly developed facial beauty evaluation regression network, which learns to distinguish attractive facial features, outperforming many existing facial beauty evaluation models in this domain. By using this data-driven approach, our method can automatically capture holistic patterns in beauty directly from data rather than relying on predefined rules, enabling more dynamic and potentially broader applications of facial beauty editing. This work demonstrates a potential new direction for automated aesthetic enhancement, offering a complementary alternative to existing methods.

> This work proposes a new perspective on the structure of Neural Networks (NNs). Traditional Neural Networks are typically tree-like structures for convenience, which can be predefined or learned by NAS methods. However, such a structure can not facilitate communications between nodes at the same level or signal transmissions to previous levels. These defects prevent effective collaboration, restricting the capabilities of neural networks. It is well-acknowledged that the biological neural system contains billions of neural units. Their connections are far more complicated than the current NN structure. To enhance the representational ability of neural networks, existing works try to increase the depth of the neural network and introduce more parameters. However, they all have limitations with constrained parameters. In this work, we introduce a synchronous graph-based structure to establish a novel way of organizing the neural units: the Neural Modules. This framework allows any nodes to communicate with each other and encourages neural units to work collectively, demonstrating a departure from the conventional constrained paradigm. Such a structure also provides more candidates for the NAS methods. Furthermore, we also propose an elegant regularization method to organize neural units into multiple independent, balanced neural modules systematically. This would be convenient for handling these neural modules in parallel. Compared to traditional NNs, our method unlocks the potential of NNs from tree-like structures to general graphs and makes NNs be optimized in an almost complete set. Our approach proves adaptable to diverse tasks, offering compatibility across various scenarios. Quantitative experimental results substantiate the potential of our structure, indicating the improvement of NNs.

> Learning parity functions is a canonical problem in learning theory, which although computationally tractable, is not amenable to standard learning algorithms such as gradient-based methods. This hardness is usually explained via statistical query lower bounds [Kearns, 1998]. However, these bounds only imply that for any given algorithm, there is some worst-case parity function that will be hard to learn. Thus, they do not explain why fixed parities - say, the full parity function over all coordinates - are difficult to learn in practice, at least with standard predictors and gradient-based methods [Abbe and Boix-Adsera, 2022]. In this paper, we address this open problem, by showing that for any fixed parity of some minimal size, using it as a target function to train one-hidden-layer ReLU networks with perturbed gradient descent will fail to produce anything meaningful. To establish this, we prove a new result about the decay of the Fourier coefficients of linear threshold (or weighted majority) functions, which may be of independent interest.

> This work introduces a novel paradigm for generalized In-Context Learning (ICL), termed Indirect In-Context Learning. In Indirect ICL, we explore demonstration selection strategies tailored for two distinct real-world scenarios: Mixture of Tasks and Noisy Demonstrations. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Influence Functions (IFs) as a selection tool for these settings, highlighting the potential for IFs to better capture the informativeness of examples within the demonstration pool. For the Mixture of Tasks setting, demonstrations are drawn from 28 diverse tasks, including MMLU, BigBench, StrategyQA, and CommonsenseQA. We demonstrate that combining BertScore-Recall (BSR) with an IF surrogate model can significantly improve performance, leading to average absolute accuracy gains of 0.37\% and 1.45\% for 3-shot and 5-shot setups when compared to traditional ICL metrics. In the Noisy Demonstrations setting, we examine scenarios where demonstrations might be mislabeled. Our experiments show that reweighting traditional ICL selectors (BSR and Cosine Similarity) with IF-based selectors boosts accuracy by an average of 2.90\% for Cosine Similarity and 2.94\% for BSR on noisy GLUE benchmarks. In sum, we propose a robust framework for demonstration selection that generalizes beyond traditional ICL, offering valuable insights into the role of IFs for Indirect ICL.

> Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version.

> Safety testing serves as the fundamental pillar for the development of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). To ensure the safety of ADSs, it is paramount to generate a diverse range of safety-critical test scenarios. While existing ADS practitioners primarily focus on reproducing real-world traffic accidents in simulation environments to create test scenarios, it's essential to highlight that many of these accidents do not directly result in safety violations for ADSs due to the differences between human driving and autonomous driving. More importantly, we observe that some accident-free real-world scenarios can not only lead to misbehaviors in ADSs but also be leveraged for the generation of ADS violations during simulation testing. Therefore, it is of significant importance to discover safety violations of ADSs from routine traffic scenarios (i.e., non-crash scenarios).   We introduce LEADE, a novel methodology to achieve the above goal. It automatically generates abstract and concrete scenarios from real-traffic videos. Then it optimizes these scenarios to search for safety violations of the ADS in semantically consistent scenarios where human-driving worked safely. Specifically, LEADE enhances the ability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to accurately construct abstract scenarios from traffic videos and generate concrete scenarios by multi-modal few-shot Chain of Thought (CoT). Based on them, LEADE assesses and increases the behavior differences between the ego vehicle and human-driving in semantic equivalent scenarios (here equivalent semantics means that each participant in test scenarios has the same behaviors as those observed in the original real traffic scenarios). We implement and evaluate LEADE on the industrial-grade Level-4 ADS, Apollo.

> Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are widely used for searching optimal solutions in complex multi-component applications. Traditional MOEAs for multi-component deep learning (MCDL) systems face challenges in enhancing the search efficiency while maintaining the diversity. To combat these, this paper proposes $\mu$MOEA, the first LLM-empowered adaptive evolutionary search algorithm to detect safety violations in MCDL systems. Inspired by the context-understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), $\mu$MOEA promotes the LLM to comprehend the optimization problem and generate an initial population tailed to evolutionary objectives. Subsequently, it employs adaptive selection and variation to iteratively produce offspring, balancing the evolutionary efficiency and diversity. During the evolutionary process, to navigate away from the local optima, $\mu$MOEA integrates the evolutionary experience back into the LLM. This utilization harnesses the LLM's quantitative reasoning prowess to generate differential seeds, breaking away from current optimal solutions. We evaluate $\mu$MOEA in finding safety violations of MCDL systems, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art MOEA methods. Experimental results show that $\mu$MOEA can significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of the evolutionary search.

> Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.

> Modern configurable systems provide tremendous opportunities for engineering future intelligent software systems. A key difficulty thereof is how to effectively self-adapt the configuration of a running system such that its performance (e.g., runtime and throughput) can be optimized under time-varying workloads. This unfortunately remains unaddressed in existing approaches as they either overlook the available past knowledge or rely on static exploitation of past knowledge without reasoning the usefulness of information when planning for self-adaptation. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by proposing DLiSA, a framework that self-adapts configurable systems. DLiSA comes with two properties: firstly, it supports lifelong planning, and thereby the planning process runs continuously throughout the lifetime of the system, allowing dynamic exploitation of the accumulated knowledge for rapid adaptation. Secondly, the planning for a newly emerged workload is boosted via distilled knowledge seeding, in which the knowledge is dynamically purified such that only useful past configurations are seeded when necessary, mitigating misleading information. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed DLiSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating a performance improvement of up to 229% and a resource acceleration of up to 2.22x on generating promising adaptation configurations.

> Semantic communication (SemCom) is regarded as a promising and revolutionary technology in 6G, aiming to transcend the constraints of ``Shannon's trap" by filtering out redundant information and extracting the core of effective data. Compared to traditional communication paradigms, SemCom offers several notable advantages, such as reducing the burden on data transmission, enhancing network management efficiency, and optimizing resource allocation. Numerous researchers have extensively explored SemCom from various perspectives, including network architecture, theoretical analysis, potential technologies, and future applications. However, as SemCom continues to evolve, a multitude of security and privacy concerns have arisen, posing threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SemCom systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the technologies that can be utilized to secure SemCom. Firstly, we elaborate on the entire life cycle of SemCom, which includes the model training, model transfer, and semantic information transmission phases. Then, we identify the security and privacy issues that emerge during these three stages. Furthermore, we summarize the techniques available to mitigate these security and privacy threats, including data cleaning, robust learning, defensive strategies against backdoor attacks, adversarial training, differential privacy, cryptography, blockchain technology, model compression, and physical-layer security. Lastly, this paper outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.

> The Hierarchical Directed Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (HDCARP) is an extension of the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), where the arcs of a graph are divided into classes based on their priority. The traversal of these classes is determined by either precedence constraints or a hierarchical objective, resulting in two distinct HDCARP variants. To the best of our knowledge, only one matheuristic has been proposed for these variants, but it performs relatively slowly, particularly for large-scale instances (Ha et al., 2024). In this paper, we propose a fast heuristic to efficiently address the computational challenges of HDCARP. Furthermore, we incorporate Reinforcement Learning (RL) into our heuristic to effectively guide the selection of local search operators, resulting in a hybrid algorithm. We name this hybrid algorithm as the Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Heuristic Algorithm for Directed Arc Routing (HRDA). The hybrid algorithm adapts to changes in the problem dynamically, using real-time feedback to improve routing strategies and solution's quality by integrating heuristic methods. Extensive computational experiments on artificial instances demonstrate that this hybrid approach significantly improves the speed of the heuristic without deteriorating the solution quality.

A key challenge when learning policies from historical data - a practice commonly referred to as off-policy learning - is how to ``identify'' the impact of a policy of interest when the observed data are not randomized. Off-policy learning has mainly been studied in two settings: dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs), where the focus is on controlling confounding in medical problems with short decision horizons, and offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the focus is on dimension reduction in closed systems such as games. The gap between these two well studied settings has limited the wider application of off-policy learning to many real-world problems. Using the theory for causal inference based on acyclic directed mixed graph (ADMGs), we provide a set of graphical identification criteria in general decision processes that encompass both DTRs and MDPs. We discuss how our results relate to the often implicit causal assumptions made in the DTR and RL literatures and further clarify several common misconceptions. Finally, we present a realistic simulation study for the dynamic pricing problem encountered in container logistics, and demonstrate how violations of our graphical criteria can lead to suboptimal policies.

> In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian average regret and Bayesian simple regret, where the bound depends on the structure of the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, demonstrating the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.

> The embedded topic model (ETM) is a widely used approach that assumes the sampled document-topic distribution conforms to the logistic normal distribution for easier optimization. However, this assumption oversimplifies the real document-topic distribution, limiting the model's performance. In response, we propose a novel method that introduces the diffusion process into the sampling process of document-topic distribution to overcome this limitation and maintain an easy optimization process. We validate our method through extensive experiments on two mainstream datasets, proving its effectiveness in improving topic modeling performance.

> This paper aims to document an effective way to improve multimodal co-learning by using aggressive modality dropout. We find that by using aggressive modality dropout we are able to reverse negative co-learning (NCL) to positive co-learning (PCL). Aggressive modality dropout can be used to "prep" a multimodal model for unimodal deployment, and dramatically increases model performance during negative co-learning, where during some experiments we saw a 20% gain in accuracy. We also benchmark our modality dropout technique against PCL to show that our modality drop out technique improves co-learning during PCL, although it does not have as much as an substantial effect as it does during NCL.

> We study a ranking and selection problem of learning from choice-based feedback with dynamic assortments. In this problem, a company sequentially displays a set of items to a population of customers and collects their choices as feedback. The only information available about the underlying choice model is that the choice probabilities are consistent with some unknown true strict ranking over the items. The objective is to identify, with the fewest samples, the most preferred item or the full ranking over the items at a high confidence level. We present novel and simple algorithms for both learning goals. In the first subproblem regarding best-item identification, we introduce an elimination-based algorithm, Nested Elimination (NE). In the more complex subproblem regarding full-ranking identification, we generalize NE and propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm, Nested Partition (NP). We provide strong characterizations of both algorithms through instance-specific and non-asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity. This is accomplished using an analytical framework that characterizes the system dynamics through analyzing a sequence of multi-dimensional random walks. We also establish a connection between our nested approach and the information-theoretic lower bounds. We thus show that NE is worst-case asymptotically optimal, and NP is optimal up to a constant factor. Finally, numerical experiments from both synthetic and real data corroborate our theoretical findings.

> Simultaneous generation models write generation results while reading streaming inputs, necessitating a policy-maker to determine the appropriate output timing. Existing simultaneous generation methods generally adopt the traditional encoder-decoder architecture and learn the generation and policy-making capabilities through complex dynamic programming techniques. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they face challenges in taking on the role of policy-makers through traditional training methods, limiting their exploration in simultaneous generation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-driven Simultaneous Generation (LSG) framework, which allows the off-the-shelf LLM to decide the generation timing and produce output concurrently. Specifically, LSG selects the generation policy that minimizes latency as the baseline policy. Referring to the baseline policy, LSG enables the LLM to devise an improved generation policy that better balances latency and generation quality, and writes generation results accordingly. Experiments on simultaneous translation and streaming automatic speech recognition tasks show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance utilizing the open-source LLMs and demonstrate practicality in real-world scenarios.

> Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from pre-existing datasets without further interactions, making it a challenging task. Q-learning algorithms struggle with extrapolation errors in offline settings, while supervised learning methods are constrained by model expressiveness. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations in single-agent learning, but their application in multi-agent scenarios remains unclear. Generating trajectories for each agent with independent DMs may impede coordination, while concatenating all agents' information can lead to low sample efficiency. Accordingly, we propose MADiff, which is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, functioning as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that MADiff outperforms baseline algorithms across various multi-agent learning tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex multi-agent interactions.

> Capitalizing on the complementary advantages of generative and discriminative models has always been a compelling vision in machine learning, backed by a growing body of research. This work discloses the hidden semantic structure within score-based generative models, unveiling their potential as effective discriminative priors. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose DUSA to exploit the structured semantic priors underlying diffusion score to facilitate the test-time adaptation of image classifiers or dense predictors. Notably, DUSA extracts knowledge from a single timestep of denoising diffusion, lifting the curse of Monte Carlo-based likelihood estimation over timesteps. We demonstrate the efficacy of our DUSA in adapting a wide variety of competitive pre-trained discriminative models on diverse test-time scenarios. Additionally, a thorough ablation study is conducted to dissect the pivotal elements in DUSA. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/DUSA.

> Oral cancer constitutes a significant global health concern, resulting in 277,484 fatalities in 2023, with the highest prevalence observed in low- and middle-income nations. Facilitating automation in the detection of possibly malignant and malignant lesions in the oral cavity could result in cost-effective and early disease diagnosis. Establishing an extensive repository of meticulously annotated oral lesions is essential. In this research photos are being collected from global clinical experts, who have been equipped with an annotation tool to generate comprehensive labelling. This research presents a novel approach for integrating bounding box annotations from various doctors. Additionally, Deep Belief Network combined with CAPSNET is employed to develop automated systems that extracted intricate patterns to address this challenging problem. This study evaluated two deep learning-based computer vision methodologies for the automated detection and classification of oral lesions to facilitate the early detection of oral cancer: image classification utilizing CAPSNET. Image classification attained an F1 score of 94.23% for detecting photos with lesions 93.46% for identifying images necessitating referral. Object detection attained an F1 score of 89.34% for identifying lesions for referral. Subsequent performances are documented about classification based on the sort of referral decision. Our preliminary findings indicate that deep learning possesses the capability to address this complex problem.

> Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and require immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive nature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with designing edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems and techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from communication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to provide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for mission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered edge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing. Central to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which enables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading more complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To further enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive offloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the optimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The associated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original non-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural network classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification accuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to existing edge-inference approaches.

> Existing neural methods for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) mostly aim at finding a single optimal solution. To discover diverse yet high-quality solutions for Multi-Solution TSP (MSTSP), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning based neural solver, which is primarily featured by an encoder-decoder structured policy. Concretely, on the one hand, a Relativization Filter (RF) is designed to enhance the robustness of the encoder to affine transformations of the instances, so as to potentially improve the quality of the found solutions. On the other hand, a Multi-Attentive Adaptive Active Search (MA3S) is tailored to allow the decoders to strike a balance between the optimality and diversity. Experimental evaluations on benchmark instances demonstrate the superiority of our method over recent neural baselines across different metrics, and its competitive performance against state-of-the-art traditional heuristics with significantly reduced computational time, ranging from $1.3\times$ to $15\times$ faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can also be applied to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

> The extraordinary success of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse array of tasks has led to an explosion of scientific and philosophical theorizing aimed at explaining how they do what they do. Unfortunately, disagreement over fundamental theoretical issues has led to stalemate, with entrenched camps of LLM optimists and pessimists often committed to very different views of how these systems work. Overcoming stalemate requires agreement on fundamental questions, and the goal of this paper is to address one such question, namely: is LLM behavior driven partly by representation-based information processing of the sort implicated in biological cognition, or is it driven entirely by processes of memorization and stochastic table look-up? This is a question about what kind of algorithm LLMs implement, and the answer carries serious implications for higher level questions about whether these systems have beliefs, intentions, concepts, knowledge, and understanding. I argue that LLM behavior is partially driven by representation-based information processing, and then I describe and defend a series of practical techniques for investigating these representations and developing explanations on their basis. The resulting account provides a groundwork for future theorizing about language models and their successors.

> While recent advancements in foundation models have significantly impacted machine learning, rigorous tests on the performance of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remain largely underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study evaluating the zero-shot, long-horizon forecasting abilities of several leading TSFMs over two synthetic datasets constituting noisy periodic time series. We assess model efficacy across different noise levels, underlying frequencies, and sampling rates. As benchmarks for comparison, we choose two statistical techniques: a Fourier transform (FFT)-based approach and a linear autoregressive (AR) model. Our findings demonstrate that while for time series with bounded periods and higher sampling rates, TSFMs can match or outperform the statistical approaches, their forecasting abilities deteriorate with longer periods, higher noise levels, lower sampling rates and more complex shapes of the time series.

> Forecasting vehicle behavior within complex traffic environments is pivotal within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Though this technology plays a significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.

> The contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is crucial in sequential decision-making. A line of research, known as online clustering of bandits, extends contextual MAB by grouping similar users into clusters, utilizing shared features to improve learning efficiency. However, existing algorithms, which rely on the upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy, struggle to gather adequate statistical information to accurately identify unknown user clusters. As a result, their theoretical analyses require several strong assumptions about the "diversity" of contexts generated by the environment, leading to impractical settings, complicated analyses, and poor practical performance. Removing these assumptions has been a long-standing open problem in the clustering of bandits literature. In this paper, we provide two solutions to this open problem. First, following the i.i.d. context generation setting in existing studies, we propose two novel algorithms, UniCLUB and PhaseUniCLUB, which incorporate enhanced exploration mechanisms to accelerate cluster identification. Remarkably, our algorithms require substantially weaker assumptions while achieving regret bounds comparable to prior work. Second, inspired by the smoothed analysis framework, we propose a more practical setting that eliminates the requirement for i.i.d. context generation used in previous studies, thus enhancing the performance of existing algorithms for online clustering of bandits. Our technique can be applied to both graph-based and set-based clustering of bandits frameworks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms consistently outperform existing approaches.

> This paper explores the application of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for economic forecasting, focusing on predicting CPI inflation rates. The study explores a new approach that integrates HMM-derived hidden states and means as additional features for LSTM modeling, aiming to enhance the interpretability and predictive performance of the models. The research begins with data collection and preprocessing, followed by the implementation of the HMM to identify hidden states representing distinct economic conditions. Subsequently, LSTM models are trained using the original and augmented data sets, allowing for comparative analysis and evaluation. The results demonstrate that incorporating HMM-derived data improves the predictive accuracy of LSTM models, particularly in capturing complex temporal patterns and mitigating the impact of volatile economic conditions. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of Integrated Gradients for model interpretability and provides insights into the economic dynamics reflected in the forecasting outcomes.

> Nowadays, harmful effects of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent. A vital issue that must be addressed is the generation of energy from non-renewable and often polluting sources. For this reason, the development of renewable energy sources is of great importance. Unfortunately, too rapid spread of renewables can disrupt stability of the power system and lead to energy blackouts. One should not simply support it, without ensuring sustainability and understanding of the diffusion process. In this research, we propose a new agent-based model of diffusion of photovoltaic panels. It is an extension of the q-voter model that utilizes a multi-layer network structure. The novelty is that both opinion dynamics and diffusion of innovation are studied simultaneously on a multidimensional structure. The model is analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations and the mean-field approximation. The impact of parameters and specifications on the basic properties of the model is discussed. Firstly, we show that for a certain range of parameters, innovation always succeeds, regardless of the initial conditions. Secondly, that the mean-field approximation gives qualitatively the same results as computer simulations, even though it does not utilize knowledge of the network structure.

> With the widespread use of social media, user-generated content has surged on online platforms. When such content includes hateful, abusive, offensive, or cyberbullying behavior, it is classified as toxic speech, posing a significant threat to the online ecosystem's integrity and safety. While manual content moderation is still prevalent, the overwhelming volume of content and the psychological strain on human moderators underscore the need for automated toxic speech detection. Previously proposed detection methods often rely on large annotated datasets; however, acquiring such datasets is both costly and challenging in practice. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-guided firewall for toxic speech in few-shot scenarios, U-GIFT, that utilizes self-training to enhance detection performance even when labeled data is limited. Specifically, U-GIFT combines active learning with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to automatically identify high-quality samples from unlabeled data, prioritizing the selection of pseudo-labels with higher confidence for training based on uncertainty estimates derived from model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-GIFT significantly outperforms competitive baselines in few-shot detection scenarios. In the 5-shot setting, it achieves a 14.92\% performance improvement over the basic model. Importantly, U-GIFT is user-friendly and adaptable to various pre-trained language models (PLMs). It also exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sample imbalance and cross-domain settings, while showcasing strong generalization across various language applications. We believe that U-GIFT provides an efficient solution for few-shot toxic speech detection, offering substantial support for automated content moderation in cyberspace, thereby acting as a firewall to promote advancements in cybersecurity.

> Diffusion models have shown promising ability in generating high-quality time series (TS) data. Despite the initial success, existing works mostly focus on the authenticity of data at the individual level, but pay less attention to preserving the population-level properties on the entire dataset. Such population-level properties include value distributions for each dimension and distributions of certain functional dependencies (e.g., cross-correlation, CC) between different dimensions. For instance, when generating house energy consumption TS data, the value distributions of the outside temperature and the kitchen temperature should be preserved, as well as the distribution of CC between them. Preserving such TS population-level properties is critical in maintaining the statistical insights of the datasets, mitigating model bias, and augmenting downstream tasks like TS prediction. Yet, it is often overlooked by existing models. Hence, data generated by existing models often bear distribution shifts from the original data. We propose Population-aware Diffusion for Time Series (PaD-TS), a new TS generation model that better preserves the population-level properties. The key novelties of PaD-TS include 1) a new training method explicitly incorporating TS population-level property preservation, and 2) a new dual-channel encoder model architecture that better captures the TS data structure. Empirical results in major benchmark datasets show that PaD-TS can improve the average CC distribution shift score between real and synthetic data by 5.9x while maintaining a performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on individual-level authenticity.

Recent studies have applied machine learning to evaluate creativity in drawings, but not paintings. Our research addresses this gap by developing a CNN model to automatically assess the creativity of human paintings. Using a dataset of six hundred paintings by professionals and children, our model achieved 90% accuracy and faster evaluation times than human raters. This approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning in advancing artistic creativity assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional methods.

> Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is challenging in domains where preference data is unavailable. We address the problem of learning reward models for such target domains by leveraging feedback collected from simpler source domains, where human preferences are easier to obtain. Our key insight is that, while domains may differ significantly, human preferences convey \emph{domain-agnostic} concepts that can be effectively captured by a reward model. We propose \method, a framework that trains domain-invariant reward models by optimizing a dual loss: a domain loss that minimizes the divergence between source and target distribution, and a source loss that optimizes preferences on the source domain. We show \method is a general approach that we evaluate and analyze across 4 distinct settings: (1) Cross-lingual transfer (accuracy: $0.621 \rightarrow 0.661$), (2) Clean-to-noisy (accuracy: $0.671 \rightarrow 0.703$), (3) Few-shot-to-full transfer (accuracy: $0.845 \rightarrow 0.920$), and (4) Simple-to-complex tasks transfer (correlation: $0.508 \rightarrow 0.556$).

> Few-shot, fine-grained classification in computer vision poses significant challenges due to the need to differentiate subtle class distinctions with limited data. This paper presents a novel method that enhances the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model through adaptive prompt tuning, guided by real-time visual inputs. Unlike existing techniques such as Context Optimization (CoOp) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), which are constrained by static prompts or visual token reliance, the proposed approach leverages a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically refine text prompts for the image at hand. This enables an image-specific alignment of textual features with image patches extracted from the Vision Transformer, making the model more effective for datasets with high intra-class variance and low inter-class differences. The method is evaluated on several datasets, including CUBirds, Oxford Flowers, and FGVC Aircraft, showing significant performance gains over static prompt tuning approaches. To ensure these performance gains translate into trustworthy predictions, we integrate Monte-Carlo Dropout in our approach to improve the reliability of the model predictions and uncertainty estimates. This integration provides valuable insights into the model's predictive confidence, helping to identify when predictions can be trusted and when additional verification is necessary. This dynamic approach offers a robust solution, advancing the state-of-the-art for few-shot fine-grained classification.

> While many sophisticated exploration methods have been proposed, their lack of generality and high computational cost often lead researchers to favor simpler methods like $\epsilon$-greedy. Motivated by this, we introduce $\beta$-DQN, a simple and efficient exploration method that augments the standard DQN with a behavior function $\beta$. This function estimates the probability that each action has been taken at each state. By leveraging $\beta$, we generate a population of diverse policies that balance exploration between state-action coverage and overestimation bias correction. An adaptive meta-controller is designed to select an effective policy for each episode, enabling flexible and explainable exploration. $\beta$-DQN is straightforward to implement and adds minimal computational overhead to the standard DQN. Experiments on both simple and challenging exploration domains show that $\beta$-DQN outperforms existing baseline methods across a wide range of tasks, providing an effective solution for improving exploration in deep reinforcement learning.

> Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.

> Representational analysis explores how input data of a neural system are encoded in high dimensional spaces of its distributed neural activations, and how we can compare different systems, for instance, artificial neural networks and brains, on those grounds. While existing methods offer important insights, they typically do not account for local intrinsic geometrical properties within the high-dimensional representation spaces. To go beyond these limitations, we explore Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Ricci flow as tools to study the alignment of representations between humans and artificial neural systems on a geometric level. As a proof-of-principle study, we compared the representations of face stimuli between VGG-Face, a human-aligned version of VGG-Face, and corresponding human similarity judgments from a large online study. Using this discrete geometric framework, we were able to identify local structural similarities and differences by examining the distributions of node and edge curvature and higher-level properties by detecting and comparing community structure in the representational graphs.

> In current chip design processes, using multiple tools to obtain a gate-level netlist often results in the loss of source code correlation. SynAlign addresses this challenge by automating the alignment process, simplifying iterative design, reducing overhead, and maintaining correlation across various tools. This enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of chip design workflows.   Improving characteristics such as frequency through iterative design is essential for enhancing accelerators and chip designs. While synthesis tools produce netlists with critical path information, designers often lack the tools to trace these netlist cells back to their original source code. Mapping netlist components to source code provides early feedback on timing and power for frontend designers.   SynAlign automatically aligns post-optimized netlists with the original source code without altering compilers or synthesis processes. Its alignment strategy relies on the consistent design structure throughout the chip design cycle, even with changes in compiler flow. This consistency allows engineers to maintain a correlation between modified designs and the original source code across various tools. Remarkably, SynAlign can tolerate up to 61\% design net changes without impacting alignment accuracy.

> With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research in real-time decision-making scenarios and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.

> Undefined behavior in C often causes devastating security vulnerabilities. One practical mitigation is compartmentalization, which allows developers to structure large programs into mutually distrustful compartments with clearly specified privileges and interactions. In this paper we introduce SECOMP, a compiler for compartmentalized C code that comes with machine-checked proofs guaranteeing that the scope of undefined behavior is restricted to the compartments that encounter it and become dynamically compromised. These guarantees are formalized as the preservation of safety properties against adversarial contexts, a secure compilation criterion similar to full abstraction, and this is the first time such a strong criterion is proven for a mainstream programming language. To achieve this we extend the languages of the CompCert verified C compiler with isolated compartments that can only interact via procedure calls and returns, as specified by cross-compartment interfaces. We adapt the passes and optimizations of CompCert as well as their correctness proofs to this compartment-aware setting. We then use compiler correctness as an ingredient in a larger secure compilation proof that involves several proof engineering novelties, needed to scale formally secure compilation up to a C compiler.

- `2501.00930v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00930v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00930v1)

> This work introduces Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx), an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG), generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem, improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx) formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.

> The rapid evolution of modern malware presents significant challenges to the development of effective defense mechanisms. Traditional cyber deception techniques often rely on static or manually configured parameters, limiting their adaptability to dynamic and sophisticated threats. This study leverages Generative AI (GenAI) models to automate the creation of adaptive cyber deception ploys, focusing on structured prompt engineering (PE) to enhance relevance, actionability, and deployability. We introduce a systematic framework (SPADE) to address inherent challenges large language models (LLMs) pose to adaptive deceptions, including generalized outputs, ambiguity, under-utilization of contextual information, and scalability constraints. Evaluations across diverse malware scenarios using metrics such as Recall, Exact Match (EM), BLEU Score, and expert quality assessments identified ChatGPT-4o as the top performer. Additionally, it achieved high engagement (93%) and accuracy (96%) with minimal refinements. Gemini and ChatGPT-4o Mini demonstrated competitive performance, with Llama3.2 showing promise despite requiring further optimization. These findings highlight the transformative potential of GenAI in automating scalable, adaptive deception strategies and underscore the critical role of structured PE in advancing real-world cybersecurity applications.

> Recently, the advent of generative AI technologies has made transformational impacts on our daily lives, yet its application in scientific applications remains in its early stages. Data scarcity is a major, well-known barrier in data-driven scientific computing, so physics-guided generative AI holds significant promise. In scientific computing, most tasks study the conversion of multiple data modalities to describe physical phenomena, for example, spatial and waveform in seismic imaging, time and frequency in signal processing, and temporal and spectral in climate modeling; as such, multi-modal pairwise data generation is highly required instead of single-modal data generation, which is usually used in natural images (e.g., faces, scenery). Moreover, in real-world applications, the unbalance of available data in terms of modalities commonly exists; for example, the spatial data (i.e., velocity maps) in seismic imaging can be easily simulated, but real-world seismic waveform is largely lacking. While the most recent efforts enable the powerful diffusion model to generate multi-modal data, how to leverage the unbalanced available data is still unclear. In this work, we use seismic imaging in subsurface geophysics as a vehicle to present ``UB-Diff'', a novel diffusion model for multi-modal paired scientific data generation. One major innovation is a one-in-two-out encoder-decoder network structure, which can ensure pairwise data is obtained from a co-latent representation. Then, the co-latent representation will be used by the diffusion process for pairwise data generation. Experimental results on the OpenFWI dataset show that UB-Diff significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) score and pairwise evaluation, indicating the generation of reliable and useful multi-modal pairwise data.

> Shortcut learning, i.e., a model's reliance on undesired features not directly relevant to the task, is a major challenge that severely limits the applications of machine learning algorithms, particularly when deploying them to assist in making sensitive decisions, such as in medical diagnostics. In this work, we leverage recent advancements in machine learning to create an unsupervised framework that is capable of both detecting and mitigating shortcut learning in transformers. We validate our method on multiple datasets. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both worst-group accuracy (samples misclassified due to shortcuts) and average accuracy, while minimizing human annotation effort. Moreover, we demonstrate that the detected shortcuts are meaningful and informative to human experts, and that our framework is computationally efficient, allowing it to be run on consumer hardware.

> Evaluating early design concepts is crucial as it impacts quality and cost. This process is often hindered by vague and uncertain design information. This article introduces the SysML-based Simulated-Physical Systems Modelling Language (SPSysML). It is a Domain-Specification Language for evaluating component reusability in Cyber-Physical Systems incorporating Digital Twins and other simulated parts. The proposed factors assess the design quantitatively. SPSysML uses a requirement-based system structuring method to couple simulated and physical parts with requirements. SPSysML-based systems incorporate DTs that perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world. SPSysML validation is survey- and application-based. First, we develop a robotic system for an assisted living project. We propose an SPSysML application procedure called SPSysAP that manages the considered system development by evaluating the system designs with the proposed quantitative factors. As a result of the SPSysML application, we observed an integrity improvement between the simulated and physical parts of the system. Thus, more system components are shared between the simulated and physical setups. The system was deployed on the physical robot and two simulators based on ROS and ROS2. Additionally, we share a questionnaire for SPSysML assessment. The feedback that we already received is published in this article.

> Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in training data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them, like image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to predict accurately on \textit{atypical} examples (minority groups) in the training set but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information. Inspired by these findings, we articulate the hypothesis: the imbalanced group performance is a byproduct of ``noisy'' spurious memorization confined to a small set of neurons. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness to spurious correlation.

> Images generated by text-to-image (T2I) models often exhibit visual biases and stereotypes of concepts such as culture and profession. Existing quantitative measures of stereotypes are based on statistical parity that does not align with the sociological definition of stereotypes and, therefore, incorrectly categorizes biases as stereotypes. Instead of oversimplifying stereotypes as biases, we propose a quantitative measure of stereotypes that aligns with its sociological definition. We then propose OASIS to measure the stereotypes in a generated dataset and understand their origins within the T2I model. OASIS includes two scores to measure stereotypes from a generated image dataset: (M1) Stereotype Score to measure the distributional violation of stereotypical attributes, and (M2) WALS to measure spectral variance in the images along a stereotypical attribute. OASIS also includes two methods to understand the origins of stereotypes in T2I models: (U1) StOP to discover attributes that the T2I model internally associates with a given concept, and (U2) SPI to quantify the emergence of stereotypical attributes in the latent space of the T2I model during image generation. Despite the considerable progress in image fidelity, using OASIS, we conclude that newer T2I models such as FLUX.1 and SDv3 contain strong stereotypical predispositions about concepts and still generate images with widespread stereotypical attributes. Additionally, the quantity of stereotypes worsens for nationalities with lower Internet footprints.

> Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) are transforming multiple aspects of society, including education and foreign language learning. In the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), significant research has been conducted to investigate the applicability of GenAI as a learning aid and the potential negative impacts of new technologies. Critical questions remain about the future of AI, including whether improvements will continue at such a pace or stall and whether there is a true benefit to implementing GenAI in education, given the myriad costs and potential for negative impacts.   Apart from the ethical conundrums that GenAI presents in EFL education, there is growing consensus that learners and teachers must develop AI literacy skills to enable them to use and critically evaluate the purposes and outputs of these technologies. However, there are few formalised frameworks available to support the integration and development of AI literacy skills for EFL learners. In this article, we demonstrate how the use of a general, all-purposes framework (the AI Assessment Scale) can be tailored to the EFL writing and translation context, drawing on existing empirical research validating the scale and adaptations to other contexts, such as English for Academic Purposes. We begin by engaging with the literature regarding GenAI and EFL writing and translation, prior to explicating the use of three levels of the updated AIAS for structuring EFL writing instruction which promotes academic literacy and transparency and provides a clear framework for students and teachers.

> The proxy pattern is a well-known design pattern with numerous use cases in several sectors of the software industry. As such, the use of the proxy pattern is also a common approach in the development of complex decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the importance of proxy contracts, little is known about (i) how their prevalence changed over time, (ii) the ways in which developers integrate proxies in the design of DApps, and (iii) what proxy types are being most commonly leveraged by developers. This study bridges these gaps through a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum smart contracts, utilizing a dataset of 50 million contracts and 1.6 billion transactions as of September 2022. Our findings reveal that 14.2% of all deployed smart contracts are proxy contracts. We show that proxy contracts are being more actively used than non-proxy contracts. Also, the usage of proxy contracts in various contexts, transactions involving proxy contracts, and adoption of proxy contracts by users have shown an upward trend over time, peaking at the end of our study period. They are either deployed through off-chain scripts or on-chain factory contracts, with the former and latter being employed in 39.1% and 60.9% of identified usage contexts in turn. We found that while the majority (67.8%) of proxies act as an interceptor, 32.2% enables upgradeability. Proxy contracts are typically (79%) implemented based on known reference implementations with 29.4% being of type ERC-1167, a class of proxies that aims to cheaply reuse and clone contracts' functionality. Our evaluation shows that our proposed behavioral proxy detection method has a precision and recall of 100% in detecting active proxies. Finally, we derive a set of practical recommendations for developers and introduce open research questions to guide future research on the topic.

> Bayesian optimization (BO) is an effective paradigm for the optimization of expensive-to-sample systems. Standard BO learns the performance of a system $f(x)$ by using a Gaussian Process (GP) model; this treats the system as a black-box and limits its ability to exploit available structural knowledge (e.g., physics and sparse interconnections in a complex system). Grey-box modeling, wherein the performance function is treated as a composition of known and unknown intermediate functions $f(x, y(x))$ (where $y(x)$ is a GP model) offers a solution to this limitation; however, generating an analytical probability density for $f$ from the Gaussian density of $y(x)$ is often an intractable problem (e.g., when $f$ is nonlinear). Previous work has handled this issue by using sampling techniques or by solving an auxiliary problem over an augmented space where the values of $y(x)$ are constrained by confidence intervals derived from the GP models; such solutions are computationally intensive. In this work, we provide a detailed implementation of a recently proposed grey-box BO paradigm, BOIS, that uses adaptive linearizations of $f$ to obtain analytical expressions for the statistical moments of the composite function. We show that the BOIS approach enables the exploitation of structural knowledge, such as that arising in interconnected systems as well as systems that embed multiple GP models and combinations of physics and GP models. We benchmark the effectiveness of BOIS against standard BO and existing grey-box BO algorithms using a pair of case studies focused on chemical process optimization and design. Our results indicate that BOIS performs as well as or better than existing grey-box methods, while also being less computationally intensive.

> The spatio-temporal interpolation of large geophysical datasets has historically been addressed by Optimal Interpolation (OI) and more sophisticated equation-based or data-driven Data Assimilation (DA) techniques. Recent advances in the deep learning community enables to address the interpolation problem through a neural architecture incorporating a variational data assimilation framework. The reconstruction task is seen as a joint learning problem of the prior involved in the variational inner cost, seen as a projection operator of the state, and the gradient-based minimization of the latter. Both prior models and solvers are stated as neural networks with automatic differentiation which can be trained by minimizing a loss function, typically the mean squared error between some ground truth and the reconstruction. Such a strategy turns out to be very efficient to improve the mean state estimation, but still needs complementary developments to quantify its related uncertainty. In this work, we use the theory of Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) and Gaussian Processes (GP) to estimate both space-and time-varying covariance of the state. Our neural variational scheme is modified to embed an augmented state formulation with both state and SPDE parametrization to estimate. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework on a spatio-temporal GP driven by diffusion-based anisotropies and on realistic Sea Surface Height (SSH) datasets. We show how our solution reaches the OI baseline in the Gaussian case. For nonlinear dynamics, as almost always stated in DA, our solution outperforms OI, while allowing for fast and interpretable online parameter estimation.

> Researchers rely on academic Web search engines to find scientific sources, but search engine mechanisms may selectively present content that aligns with biases embedded in queries. This study examines whether confirmation biased queries prompted into Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar will yield results aligned with a query's bias. Six queries (topics across health and technology domains such as vaccines, Internet use) were analyzed for disparities in search results. We confirm that biased queries (targeting benefits or risks) affect search results in line with bias, with technology-related queries displaying more significant disparities. Overall, Semantic Scholar exhibited fewer disparities than Google Scholar. Topics rated as more polarizing did not consistently show more disparate results. Academic search results that perpetuate confirmation bias have strong implications for both researchers and citizens searching for evidence. More research is needed to explore how scientific inquiry and academic search engines interact.

> In the field of video compression, the pursuit for better quality at lower bit rates remains a long-lasting goal. Recent developments have demonstrated the potential of Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a promising alternative to traditional transform-based methodologies. Video INRs can be roughly divided into frame-wise and pixel-wise methods according to the structure the network outputs. While the pixel-based methods are better for upsampling and parallelization, frame-wise methods demonstrated better performance. We introduce CoordFlow, a novel pixel-wise INR for video compression. It yields state-of-the-art results compared to other pixel-wise INRs and on-par performance compared to leading frame-wise techniques. The method is based on the separation of the visual information into visually consistent layers, each represented by a dedicated network that compensates for the layer's motion. When integrated, a byproduct is an unsupervised segmentation of video sequence. Objects motion trajectories are implicitly utilized to compensate for visual-temporal redundancies. Additionally, the proposed method provides inherent video upsampling, stabilization, inpainting, and denoising capabilities.

> How should one leverage historical data when past observations are not perfectly indicative of the future, e.g., due to the presence of unobserved confounders which one cannot "correct" for? Motivated by this question, we study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. This work aims at analyzing the performance of central data-driven policies but also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous environments and understanding key drivers of performance. We establish a first result which allows to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric, we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by Sample Average Approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate through several widely-studied problems -- e.g., newsvendor, pricing -- how this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of alternative policies to achieve rate-optimality. We derive problem-dependent policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described above and provide initial results towards a principled approach for the design and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.

- *Santiago Aranguri, Francesco Insulla*

- `2412.07972v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07972v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07972v3)

> We analyze the training of a two-layer autoencoder used to parameterize a flow-based generative model for sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian mixture. Previous work shows that the phase where the relative probability between the modes is learned disappears as the dimension goes to infinity without an appropriate time schedule. We introduce a time dilation that solves this problem. This enables us to characterize the learned velocity field, finding a first phase where the probability of each mode is learned and a second phase where the variance of each mode is learned. We find that the autoencoder representing the velocity field learns to simplify by estimating only the parameters relevant to each phase. Turning to real data, we propose a method that, for a given feature, finds intervals of time where training improves accuracy the most on that feature. Since practitioners take a uniform distribution over training times, our method enables more efficient training. We provide preliminary experiments validating this approach.

> In light of Phillips' contention regarding the impracticality of Search Neutrality, asserting that non-epistemic factors presently dictate result prioritization, our objective in this study is to confront this constraint by questioning prevailing design practices in search engines. We posit that the concept of prioritization warrants scrutiny, along with the consistent hierarchical ordering that underlies this lack of neutrality. We introduce the term Search Plurality to encapsulate the idea of emphasizing the various means a query can be approached. This is demonstrated in a design that prioritizes the display of categories over specific search items, helping users grasp the breadth of their search. Whether a query allows for multiple interpretations or invites diverse opinions, the presentation of categories highlights the significance of organizing data based on relevance, importance, and relative significance, akin to traditional methods. However, unlike previous approaches, this method enriches our comprehension of the overall information landscape, countering the potential bias introduced by ranked lists.

> Recent works have shown that diffusion models can undergo phase transitions, the resolution of which is needed for accurately generating samples. This has motivated the use of different noise schedules, the two most common choices being referred to as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE). Here we revisit these schedules within the framework of stochastic interpolants. Using the Gaussian Mixture (GM) and Curie-Weiss (CW) data distributions as test case models, we first investigate the effect of the variance of the initial noise distribution and show that VP recovers the low-level feature (the distribution of each mode) but misses the high-level feature (the asymmetry between modes), whereas VE performs oppositely. We also show that this dichotomy, which happens when denoising by a constant amount in each step, can be avoided by using noise schedules specific to VP and VE that allow for the recovery of both high- and low-level features. Finally we show that these schedules yield generative models for the GM and CW model whose probability flow ODE can be discretized using $\Theta_d(1)$ steps in dimension $d$ instead of the $\Theta_d(\sqrt{d})$ steps required by constant denoising.

> In reinforcement learning, especially in sparse-reward domains, many environment steps are required to observe reward information. In order to increase the frequency of such observations, "potential-based reward shaping" (PBRS) has been proposed as a method of providing a more dense reward signal while leaving the optimal policy invariant. However, the required "potential function" must be carefully designed with task-dependent knowledge to not deter training performance. In this work, we propose a "bootstrapped" method of reward shaping, termed BSRS, in which the agent's current estimate of the state-value function acts as the potential function for PBRS. We provide convergence proofs for the tabular setting, give insights into training dynamics for deep RL, and show that the proposed method improves training speed in the Atari suite.

> Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column augmentation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation.

> Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a vital component in various everyday applications. Cross-corpus SER models are increasingly recognized for their ability to generalize performance. However, concerns arise regarding fairness across demographics in diverse corpora. Existing fairness research often focuses solely on corpus-specific fairness, neglecting its generalizability in cross-corpus scenarios. Our study focuses on this underexplored area, examining the gender fairness generalizability in cross-corpus SER scenarios. We emphasize that the performance of cross-corpus SER models and their fairness are two distinct considerations. Moreover, we propose the approach of a combined fairness adaptation mechanism to enhance gender fairness in the SER transfer learning tasks by addressing both source and target genders. Our findings bring one of the first insights into the generalizability of gender fairness in cross-corpus SER systems.

> To address the growing size of AI model training data and the lack of a universal data selection methodology-factors that significantly drive up training costs -- this paper presents the General Information Metrics Evaluation (GIME) method. GIME leverages general information metrics from Objective Information Theory (OIT), including volume, delay, scope, granularity, variety, duration, sampling rate, aggregation, coverage, distortion, and mismatch to optimize dataset selection for training purposes. Comprehensive experiments conducted across diverse domains, such as CTR Prediction, Civil Case Prediction, and Weather Forecasting, demonstrate that GIME effectively preserves model performance while substantially reducing both training time and costs. Additionally, applying GIME within the Judicial AI Program led to a remarkable 39.56% reduction in total model training expenses, underscoring its potential to support efficient and sustainable AI development.

> Flight test analysis often requires predefined test points with arbitrarily tight tolerances, leading to extensive and resource-intensive experimental campaigns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to flight test analysis using Gaussian processes (GPs) with physics-informed mean functions to estimate aerodynamic quantities from arbitrary flight test data, validated using real T-38 aircraft data collected in collaboration with the United States Air Force Test Pilot School. We demonstrate our method by estimating the pitching moment coefficient without requiring predefined or repeated flight test points, significantly reducing the need for extensive experimental campaigns. Our approach incorporates aerodynamic models as priors within the GP framework, enhancing predictive accuracy across diverse flight conditions and providing robust uncertainty quantification. Key contributions include the integration of physics-based priors in a probabilistic model, which allows for precise computation from arbitrary flight test maneuvers, and the demonstration of our method capturing relevant dynamic characteristics such as short-period mode behavior. The proposed framework offers a scalable and generalizable solution for efficient data-driven flight test analysis and is able to accurately predict the short period frequency and damping for the T-38 across several Mach and dynamic pressure profiles.

> Data is essential for secondary use, but ensuring its privacy while allowing such use is a critical challenge. Various techniques have been proposed to address privacy concerns in data sharing and publishing. However, these methods often degrade data utility, impacting the performance of machine learning (ML) models. Our research identifies key limitations in existing optimization models for privacy preservation, particularly in handling categorical variables, assessing data utility, and evaluating effectiveness across diverse datasets. We propose a novel multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes information loss and maximizes protection against attacks. This model is empirically validated using diverse datasets and compared with two existing algorithms. We assess information loss, the number of individuals subject to linkage or homogeneity attacks, and ML performance after anonymization. The results indicate that our model achieves lower information loss and more effectively mitigates the risk of attacks, reducing the number of individuals susceptible to these attacks compared to alternative algorithms in some cases. Additionally, our model maintains comparative ML performance relative to the original data or data anonymized by other methods. Our findings highlight significant improvements in privacy protection and ML model performance, offering a comprehensive framework for balancing privacy and utility in data sharing.

> Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine.

> Cloud computing has revolutionized the provisioning of computing resources, offering scalable, flexible, and on-demand services to meet the diverse requirements of modern applications. At the heart of efficient cloud operations are job scheduling and resource management, which are critical for optimizing system performance and ensuring timely and cost-effective service delivery. However, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of cloud environments presents significant challenges for these tasks, as workloads and resource availability can fluctuate unpredictably. Traditional approaches, including heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, often struggle to adapt to these real-time changes due to their reliance on static models or predefined rules. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges by enabling systems to learn and adapt policies based on continuous observations of the environment, facilitating intelligent and responsive decision-making. This survey provides a comprehensive review of DRL-based algorithms for job scheduling and resource management in cloud computing, analyzing their methodologies, performance metrics, and practical applications. We also highlight emerging trends and future research directions, offering valuable insights into leveraging DRL to advance both job scheduling and resource management in cloud computing.

> This paper studies an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system for low-altitude economy (LAE), where a ground base station (GBS) provides communication and navigation services for authorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while sensing the low-altitude airspace to monitor the unauthorized mobile target. The expected communication sum-rate over a given flight period is maximized by jointly optimizing the beamforming at the GBS and UAVs' trajectories, subject to the constraints on the average signal-to-noise ratio requirement for sensing, the flight mission and collision avoidance of UAVs, as well as the maximum transmit power at the GBS. Typically, this is a sequential decision-making problem with the given flight mission. Thus, we transform it to a specific Markov decision process (MDP) model called episode task. Based on this modeling, we propose a novel LAE-oriented ISAC scheme, referred to as Deep LAE-ISAC (DeepLSC), by leveraging the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. In DeepLSC, a reward function and a new action selection policy termed constrained noise-exploration policy are judiciously designed to fulfill various constraints. To enable efficient learning in episode tasks, we develop a hierarchical experience replay mechanism, where the gist is to employ all experiences generated within each episode to jointly train the neural network. Besides, to enhance the convergence speed of DeepLSC, a symmetric experience augmentation mechanism, which simultaneously permutes the indexes of all variables to enrich available experience sets, is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with benchmarks, DeepLSC yields a higher sum-rate while meeting the preset constraints, achieves faster convergence, and is more robust against different settings.

> Predicting Bitcoin price remains a challenging problem due to the high volatility and complex non-linear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.

> The application of machine learning to the study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impacts on Earth has seen significant growth recently. Understanding and forecasting CME geoeffectiveness is crucial for protecting infrastructure in space and ensuring the resilience of technological systems on Earth. Here we present GeoCME, a deep-learning framework designed to predict, deterministically or probabilistically, whether a CME event that arrives at Earth will cause a geomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm is defined as a disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere during which the minimum Dst index value is less than -50 nT. GeoCME is trained on observations from the instruments including LASCO C2, EIT and MDI on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), focusing on a dataset that includes 136 halo/partial halo CMEs in Solar Cycle 23. Using ensemble and transfer learning techniques, GeoCME is capable of extracting features hidden in the SOHO observations and making predictions based on the learned features. Our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of GeoCME, achieving a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.807 and a true skill statistics score of 0.714 when the tool is used as a deterministic prediction model. When the tool is used as a probabilistic forecasting model, it achieves a Brier score of 0.094 and a Brier skill score of 0.493. These results are promising, showing that the proposed GeoCME can help enhance our understanding of CME-triggered solar-terrestrial interactions.

> We propose the Hyperbolic Tangent Exponential Linear Unit (TeLU), a neural network hidden activation function defined as TeLU(x)=xtanh(exp(x)). TeLU's design is grounded in the core principles of key activation functions, achieving strong convergence by closely approximating the identity function in its active region while effectively mitigating the vanishing gradient problem in its saturating region. Its simple formulation enhances computational efficiency, leading to improvements in scalability and convergence speed. Unlike many modern activation functions, TeLU seamlessly combines the simplicity and effectiveness of ReLU with the smoothness and analytic properties essential for learning stability in deep neural networks. TeLU's ability to mimic the behavior and optimal hyperparameter settings of ReLU, while introducing the benefits of smoothness and curvature, makes it an ideal drop-in replacement. Its analytic nature positions TeLU as a powerful universal approximator, enhancing both robustness and generalization across a multitude of experiments. We rigorously validate these claims through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating TeLU's performance across challenging benchmarks; including ResNet18 on ImageNet, Dynamic-Pooling Transformers on Text8, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on the Penn TreeBank dataset. These results highlight TeLU's potential to set a new standard in activation functions, driving more efficient and stable learning in deep neural networks, thereby accelerating scientific discoveries across various fields.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that exhibit transferability across various models. Numerous approaches are proposed to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples, including advanced optimization, data augmentation, and model modifications. However, these methods still show limited transferability, particularly in cross-architecture scenarios, such as from CNN to ViT. To achieve high transferability, we propose a technique termed Spatial Adversarial Alignment (SAA), which employs an alignment loss and leverages a witness model to fine-tune the surrogate model. Specifically, SAA consists of two key parts: spatial-aware alignment and adversarial-aware alignment. First, we minimize the divergences of features between the two models in both global and local regions, facilitating spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a self-adversarial strategy that leverages adversarial examples to impose further constraints, aligning features from an adversarial perspective. Through this alignment, the surrogate model is trained to concentrate on the common features extracted by the witness model. This facilitates adversarial attacks on these shared features, thereby yielding perturbations that exhibit enhanced transferability. Extensive experiments on various architectures on ImageNet show that aligned surrogate models based on SAA can provide higher transferable adversarial examples, especially in cross-architecture attacks.

> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.   In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.

> Deep Metric Learning (DML) has shown remarkable successes in many domains by taking advantage of powerful deep neural networks. Deep neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks and could be easily fooled by adversarial examples. The current progress on this robustness issue is mainly about deep classification models but pays little attention to DML models. Existing works fail to thoroughly inspect the robustness of DML and neglect an important DML scenario, the clustering-based inference. In this work, we first point out the robustness issue of DML models in clustering-based inference scenarios. We find that, for the clustering-based inference, existing defenses designed DML are unable to be reused and the adaptions of defenses designed for deep classification models cannot achieve satisfactory robustness performance. To alleviate the hazard of adversarial examples, we propose a new defense, the Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT), which exploits ensemble learning and adversarial training. EAT promotes the diversity of the ensemble, encouraging each model in the ensemble to have different robustness features, and employs a self-transferring mechanism to make full use of the robustness statistics of the whole ensemble in the update of every single model. We evaluate the EAT method on three widely-used datasets with two popular model architectures. The results show that the proposed EAT method greatly outperforms the adaptions of defenses designed for deep classification models.

> Reasoning is fundamental to human intelligence, and critical for problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking. Reasoning refers to drawing new conclusions based on existing knowledge, which can support various applications like clinical diagnosis, basic education, and financial analysis. Though a good number of surveys have been proposed for reviewing reasoning-related methods, none of them has systematically investigated these methods from the viewpoint of their dependent knowledge base. Both the scenarios to which the knowledge bases are applied and their storage formats are significantly different. Hence, investigating reasoning methods from the knowledge base perspective helps us better understand the challenges and future directions. To fill this gap, this paper first classifies the knowledge base into symbolic and parametric ones. The former explicitly stores information in human-readable symbols, and the latter implicitly encodes knowledge within parameters. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of reasoning methods using symbolic knowledge bases, parametric knowledge bases, and both of them. Finally, we identify the future direction toward enhancing reasoning capabilities to bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence.

> With the advent of vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems, such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) and other automated driving features, the potential for cyberattacks on these automated vehicles (AVs) has emerged. While overt attacks that force vehicles to collide may be easily identified, more insidious attacks, which only slightly alter driving behavior, can result in network-wide increases in congestion, fuel consumption, and even crash risk without being easily detected. To address the detection of such attacks, we first present a traffic model framework for three types of potential cyberattacks: malicious manipulation of vehicle control commands, false data injection attacks on sensor measurements, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We then investigate the impacts of these attacks at both the individual vehicle (micro) and traffic flow (macro) levels. A novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based anomaly detection model is proposed for real-time identification of such attacks using vehicle trajectory data. We provide numerical evidence {to demonstrate} the efficacy of our machine learning approach in detecting cyberattacks on ACC-equipped vehicles. The proposed method is compared against some recently proposed neural network models and observed to have higher accuracy in identifying anomalous driving behaviors of ACC vehicles.

> Cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to their tendency to embed Western-centric biases from training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness issues in cross-cultural contexts. Recent approaches, such as role-assignment and few-shot learning, often struggle with reliable cultural alignment as they heavily rely on pre-trained knowledge, lack scalability, and fail to capture nuanced cultural values effectively. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with in-context learning to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. Subsequently, we curated several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. ValuesRAG consistently outperforms baseline methods, both in the main experiment and in the ablation study where only the values summary was provided, highlighting ValuesRAG's potential to foster culturally aligned AI systems and enhance the inclusivity of AI-driven applications.

> We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates forward and inverse causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of the operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in a doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described.

> In this work, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of a two-stage pipeline to evaluate literary machine translation, in a fine-grained manner, from English to Korean. The results show that our framework provides fine-grained, interpretable metrics suited for literary translation and obtains a higher correlation with human judgment than traditional machine translation metrics. Nonetheless, it still fails to match inter-human agreement, especially in metrics like Korean Honorifics. We also observe that LLMs tend to favor translations generated by other LLMs, and we highlight the necessity of developing more sophisticated evaluation methods to ensure accurate and culturally sensitive machine translation of literary works.

> This paper introduces Conformal Thresholded Intervals (CTI), a novel conformal regression method that aims to produce the smallest possible prediction set with guaranteed coverage. Unlike existing methods that rely on nested conformal frameworks and full conditional distribution estimation, CTI estimates the conditional probability density for a new response to fall into each interquantile interval using off-the-shelf multi-output quantile regression. By leveraging the inverse relationship between interval length and probability density, CTI constructs prediction sets by thresholding the estimated conditional interquantile intervals based on their length. The optimal threshold is determined using a calibration set to ensure marginal coverage, effectively balancing the trade-off between prediction set size and coverage. CTI's approach is computationally efficient and avoids the complexity of estimating the full conditional distribution. The method is theoretically grounded, with provable guarantees for marginal coverage and achieving the smallest prediction size given by Neyman-Pearson . Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CTI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art conformal regression methods across various datasets, consistently producing smaller prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage level. The proposed method offers a simple yet effective solution for reliable uncertainty quantification in regression tasks, making it an attractive choice for practitioners seeking accurate and efficient conformal prediction.

> As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.

> Transformer-based LLMs have achieved exceptional performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, the standard self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic time complexity and linearly increased cache size. Sliding window attention (SWA) solves this problem by restricting the attention range to a fixed-size local context window. Nevertheless, SWA employs a uniform window size for each head in each layer, making it inefficient in capturing context of varying scales. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Multi-Scale Window Attention (MSWA) which applies diverse window sizes across heads and layers in the Transformer. It not only allows for different window sizes among heads within the same layer but also progressively increases window size allocation from shallow to deep layers, thus enabling the model to capture contextual information with different lengths and distances. Experimental results on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks substantiate that MSWA outperforms traditional local attention in both effectiveness and efficiency.

- `2501.01042v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01042v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01042v1)

> Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models--a common and practical real world scenario--remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal model (IMM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and temporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. In addition, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rates of 55.48% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for VideoQA tasks, respectively. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

> Uncertainty quantification is essential in decision-making, especially when joint distributions of random variables are involved. While conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with valid coverage guarantees, it traditionally focuses on single predictions. This paper introduces novel conformal prediction methods for estimating the sum or average of unknown labels over specific index sets. We develop conformal prediction intervals for single target to the prediction interval for sum of multiple targets. Under permutation invariant assumptions, we prove the validity of our proposed method. We also apply our algorithms on class average estimation and path cost prediction tasks, and we show that our method outperforms existing conformalized approaches as well as non-conformal approaches.

> Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in various tasks, they present potential safety risks, such as `jailbreaks', where malicious inputs can coerce LLMs into generating harmful content bypassing safety alignments. In this paper, we delve into the ethical biases in LLMs and examine how those biases could be exploited for jailbreaks. Notably, these biases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by 20\% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16\% between white and black keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We introduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by these safety-induced biases. BiasJailbreak generates biased keywords automatically by asking the target LLM itself, and utilizes the keywords to generate harmful output. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method BiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts prior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text generation. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually lead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more secure and unbiased. To enable further research and improvements, we open-source our code and artifacts of BiasJailbreak, providing the community with tools to better understand and mitigate safety-induced biases in LLMs.

> Sepsis is a severe condition responsible for many deaths in the United States and worldwide, making accurate prediction of outcomes crucial for timely and effective treatment. Previous studies employing machine learning faced limitations in feature selection and model interpretability, reducing their clinical applicability. This research aimed to develop an interpretable and accurate machine learning model to predict in-hospital sepsis mortality, addressing these gaps. Using ICU patient records from the MIMIC-III database, we extracted relevant data through a combination of literature review, clinical input refinement, and Random Forest-based feature selection, identifying the top 35 features. Data preprocessing included cleaning, imputation, standardization, and applying the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, resulting in a dataset of 4,683 patients with 17,429 admissions. Five models-Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor-were developed and evaluated. The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.90, AUROC of 0.97, precision of 0.93, recall of 0.91, and F1-score of 0.92. These findings underscore the potential of data-driven machine learning approaches to improve critical care, offering clinicians a powerful tool for predicting in-hospital sepsis mortality and enhancing patient outcomes.

> Current large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce accurate responses on the first attempt for complex reasoning tasks like code generation. Prior research tackles this challenge by generating multiple candidate solutions and validating them with LLM-generated unit tests. The execution results of unit tests serve as reward signals to identify correct solutions. As LLMs always confidently make mistakes, these unit tests are not reliable, thereby diminishing the quality of reward signals. Motivated by the observation that scaling the number of solutions improves LLM performance, we explore the impact of scaling unit tests to enhance reward signal quality. Our pioneer experiment reveals a positive correlation between the number of unit tests and reward signal quality, with greater benefits observed in more challenging problems. Based on these insights, we propose CodeRM-8B, a lightweight yet effective unit test generator that enables efficient and high-quality unit test scaling. Additionally, we implement a dynamic scaling mechanism that adapts the number of unit tests based on problem difficulty, further improving efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves performance across various models on three benchmarks (e.g., with gains of 18.43% for Llama3-8B and 3.42% for GPT-4o-mini on HumanEval Plus).

> Multi-task semantic communication can serve multiple learning tasks using a shared encoder model. Existing models have overlooked the intricate relationships between features extracted during an encoding process of tasks. This paper presents a new graph attention inter-block (GAI) module to the encoder/transmitter of a multi-task semantic communication system, which enriches the features for multiple tasks by embedding the intermediate outputs of encoding in the features, compared to the existing techniques. The key idea is that we interpret the outputs of the intermediate feature extraction blocks of the encoder as the nodes of a graph to capture the correlations of the intermediate features. Another important aspect is that we refine the node representation using a graph attention mechanism to extract the correlations and a multi-layer perceptron network to associate the node representations with different tasks. Consequently, the intermediate features are weighted and embedded into the features transmitted for executing multiple tasks at the receiver. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses the most competitive and publicly available models by 11.4% on the CityScapes 2Task dataset and outperforms the established state-of-the-art by 3.97% on the NYU V2 3Task dataset, respectively, when the bandwidth ratio of the communication channel (i.e., compression level for transmission over the channel) is as constrained as 1 12 .

> Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex relationships between objects across various fields. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.

> Recent studies have highlighted significant fairness issues in Graph Transformer (GT) models, particularly against subgroups defined by sensitive features. Additionally, GTs are computationally intensive and memory-demanding, limiting their application to large-scale graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that graph partitioning can enhance the fairness of GT models while reducing computational complexity. To understand this improvement, we conducted a theoretical investigation into the root causes of fairness issues in GT models. We found that the sensitive features of higher-order nodes disproportionately influence lower-order nodes, resulting in sensitive feature bias. We propose Fairness-aware scalable GT based on Graph Partitioning (FairGP), which partitions the graph to minimize the negative impact of higher-order nodes. By optimizing attention mechanisms, FairGP mitigates the bias introduced by global attention, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive empirical evaluations on six real-world datasets validate the superior performance of FairGP in achieving fairness compared to state-of-the-art methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGP.

> Large language models are increasingly being integrated into applications that shape the production and discovery of societal knowledge such as search, online education, and travel planning. As a result, language models will shape how people learn about, perceive and interact with global cultures making it important to consider whose knowledge systems and perspectives are represented in models. Recognizing this importance, increasingly work in Machine Learning and NLP has focused on evaluating gaps in global cultural representational distribution within outputs. However, more work is needed on developing benchmarks for cross-cultural impacts of language models that stem from a nuanced sociologically-aware conceptualization of cultural impact or harm. We join this line of work arguing for the need of metricizable evaluations of language technologies that interrogate and account for historical power inequities and differential impacts of representation on global cultures, particularly for cultures already under-represented in the digital corpora. We look at two concepts of erasure: omission: where cultures are not represented at all and simplification i.e. when cultural complexity is erased by presenting one-dimensional views of a rich culture. The former focuses on whether something is represented, and the latter on how it is represented. We focus our analysis on two task contexts with the potential to influence global cultural production. First, we probe representations that a language model produces about different places around the world when asked to describe these contexts. Second, we analyze the cultures represented in the travel recommendations produced by a set of language model applications. Our study shows ways in which the NLP community and application developers can begin to operationalize complex socio-cultural considerations into standard evaluations and benchmarks.

> The growing necessity for enhanced processing capabilities in edge devices with limited resources has led us to develop effective methods for improving high-performance computing (HPC) applications. In this paper, we introduce LASP (Lightweight Autotuning of Scientific Application Parameters), a novel strategy designed to address the parameter search space challenge in edge devices. Our strategy employs a multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique focused on online exploration and exploitation. Notably, LASP takes a dynamic approach, adapting seamlessly to changing environments. We tested LASP with four HPC applications: Lulesh, Kripke, Clomp, and Hypre. Its lightweight nature makes it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices. By employing the MAB framework to efficiently navigate the search space, we achieved significant performance improvements while adhering to the stringent computational limits of edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LASP in optimizing parameter search on edge devices.

> The Transformer architecture is widely applied in sequence modeling applications, yet the theoretical understanding of its working principles remains limited. In this work, we investigate the approximation rate for single-layer Transformers with one head. We consider a class of non-linear relationships and identify a novel notion of complexity measures to establish an explicit Jackson-type approximation rate estimate for the Transformer. This rate reveals the structural properties of the Transformer and suggests the types of sequential relationships it is best suited for approximating. In particular, the results on approximation rates enable us to concretely analyze the differences between the Transformer and classical sequence modeling methods, such as recurrent neural networks.

Our uncertainty evaluation experiments reveal a strong correlation between high uncertainty and hallucinations. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms encode signals indicative of contextual utilization, validated through probing analysis. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Attention-Guided Context Decoding (DAGCD), a lightweight framework that integrates attention distributions and uncertainty signals in a single-pass decoding process. Experiments across QA datasets demonstrate DAGCD's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in faithfulness and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.

> The nature of modern data is increasingly real-time, making outlier detection crucial in any data-related field, such as finance for fraud detection and healthcare for monitoring patient vitals. Traditional outlier detection methods, such as the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm, struggle with real-time data due to the need for extensive recalculations with each new data point, limiting their application in real-time environments. While the Incremental LOF (ILOF) algorithm has been developed to tackle the challenges of online anomaly detection, it remains computationally expensive when processing large streams of data points, and its detection performance may degrade after a certain threshold of points have streamed in. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of LOF algorithms for online anomaly detection, named the Efficient Incremental LOF (EILOF) algorithm. The EILOF algorithm only computes the LOF scores of new points without altering the LOF scores of existing data points. Although exact LOF scores have not yet been computed for the existing points in the new algorithm, datasets often contain noise, and minor deviations in LOF score calculations do not necessarily degrade detection performance. In fact, such deviations can sometimes enhance outlier detection. We systematically tested this approach on both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that EILOF outperforms ILOF as the volume of streaming data increases across various scenarios. The EILOF algorithm not only significantly reduces computational costs, but also systematically improves detection accuracy when the number of additional points increases compared to the ILOF algorithm.

> Proteins are sequences of amino acids that serve as the basic building blocks of living organisms. Despite rapidly growing databases documenting structural and functional information for various protein sequences, our understanding of proteins remains limited because of the large possible sequence space and the complex inter- and intra-molecular forces. Deep learning, which is characterized by its ability to learn relevant features directly from large datasets, has demonstrated remarkable performance in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. It has also been increasingly applied in recent years to the data-rich domain of protein sequences with great success, most notably with Alphafold2's breakout performance in the protein structure prediction. The performance improvements achieved by deep learning unlocks new possibilities in the field of protein bioinformatics, including protein design, one of the most difficult but useful tasks. In this paper, we broadly categorize problems in protein bioinformatics into three main categories: 1) structural prediction, 2) functional prediction, and 3) protein design, and review the progress achieved from using deep learning methodologies in each of them. We expand on the main challenges of the protein design problem and highlight how advances in structural and functional prediction have directly contributed to design tasks. Finally, we conclude by identifying important topics and future research directions.

> In the realm of neural architecture design, achieving high performance is largely reliant on the manual expertise of researchers. Despite the emergence of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) as a promising technique for automating this process, current NAS methods still require human input to expand the search space and cannot generate new architectures. This paper explores the potential of Transformers in comprehending neural architectures and their performance, with the objective of establishing the foundation for utilizing Transformers to generate novel networks. We propose the Token-based Architecture Transformer (TART), which predicts neural network performance without the need to train candidate networks. TART attains state-of-the-art performance on the DeepNets-1M dataset for performance prediction tasks without edge information, indicating the potential of Transformers to aid in discovering novel and high-performing neural architectures.

> Embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing universal text embedding models that can generalize across tasks (e.g., MTEB). However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite its importance and practicality. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets covering both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -> Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, which encodes text or images independently without any task instruction, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on SoTA VLMs like Phi-3.5-V, LLaVA-1.6 and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. Our results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB. We show that VLMs are secretly strong embedding models.

> Ensuring reliable ATM services is essential for modern banking, directly impacting customer satisfaction and the operational efficiency of financial institutions. This study introduces a data fusion approach that utilizes multi-classifier fusion techniques, with a special focus on the Stacking Classifier, to enhance the reliability of ATM networks. To address class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, enabling balanced learning for both frequent and rare events. The proposed framework integrates diverse classification models - Random Forest, LightGBM, and CatBoost - within a Stacking Classifier, achieving a dramatic reduction in false alarms from 3.56 percent to just 0.71 percent, along with an outstanding overall accuracy of 99.29 percent. This multi-classifier fusion method synthesizes the strengths of individual models, leading to significant cost savings and improved operational decision-making. By demonstrating the power of machine learning and data fusion in optimizing ATM status detection, this research provides practical and scalable solutions for financial institutions aiming to enhance their ATM network performance and customer satisfaction.

> Self-Admitted Technical Debt, or SATD, is a self-admission of technical debt present in a software system. To effectively manage SATD, developers need to estimate its priority and assess the effort required to fix the described technical debt. About a quarter of descriptions of SATD in software systems express some form of negativity or negative emotions when describing technical debt. In this paper, we report on an experiment conducted with 59 respondents to study whether negativity expressed in the description of SATD \textbf{actually} affects the prioritization of SATD. The respondents are a mix of professional developers and students, and in the experiment, we asked participants to prioritize four vignettes: two expressing negativity and two expressing neutral sentiment. To ensure realism, vignettes were based on existing SATD. We find that negativity causes between one-third and half of developers to prioritize SATD, in which negativity is expressed as having more priority. Developers affected by negativity when prioritizing SATD are twice as likely to increase their estimation of urgency and 1.5 times as likely to increase their estimation of importance and effort for SATD compared to the likelihood of decreasing these prioritization scores. Our findings show how developers actively use negativity in SATD to determine how urgently a particular instance of TD should be addressed. However, our study also describes a gap in the actions and belief of developers. Even if 33% to 50% use negativity to prioritize SATD, 67% of developers believe that using negativity as a proxy for priority is unacceptable. Therefore, we would not recommend using negativity as a proxy for priority. However, we also recognize that developers might unavoidably express negativity when describing technical debt.

> Automatic text summarization, particularly headline generation, remains a critical yet underexplored area for Bengali religious news. Existing approaches to headline generation typically rely solely on the article content, overlooking crucial contextual features such as sentiment, category, and aspect. This limitation significantly hinders their effectiveness and overall performance. This study addresses this limitation by introducing a novel corpus, BeliN (Bengali Religious News) - comprising religious news articles from prominent Bangladeshi online newspapers, and MultiGen - a contextual multi-input feature fusion headline generation approach. Leveraging transformer-based pre-trained language models such as BanglaT5, mBART, mT5, and mT0, MultiGen integrates additional contextual features - including category, aspect, and sentiment - with the news content. This fusion enables the model to capture critical contextual information often overlooked by traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MultiGen over the baseline approach that uses only news content, achieving a BLEU score of 18.61 and ROUGE-L score of 24.19, compared to baseline approach scores of 16.08 and 23.08, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating contextual features in headline generation for low-resource languages. By bridging linguistic and cultural gaps, this research advances natural language processing for Bengali and other underrepresented languages. To promote reproducibility and further exploration, the dataset and implementation code are publicly accessible at https://github.com/akabircs/BeliN.

> This article provides a comprehensive exploration of submodular maximization problems, focusing on those subject to uniform and partition matroids. Crucial for a wide array of applications in fields ranging from computer science to systems engineering, submodular maximization entails selecting elements from a discrete set to optimize a submodular utility function under certain constraints. We explore the foundational aspects of submodular functions and matroids, outlining their core properties and illustrating their application through various optimization scenarios. Central to our exposition is the discussion on algorithmic strategies, particularly the sequential greedy algorithm and its efficacy under matroid constraints. Additionally, we extend our analysis to distributed submodular maximization, highlighting the challenges and solutions for large-scale, distributed optimization problems. This work aims to succinctly bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications in submodular maximization, providing a solid foundation for researchers navigating this intricate domain.

> Graph generation is a critical task in numerous domains, including molecular design and social network analysis, due to its ability to model complex relationships and structured data. While most modern graph generative models utilize adjacency matrix representations, this work revisits an alternative approach that represents graphs as sequences of node set and edge set. We advocate for this approach due to its efficient encoding of graphs and propose a novel representation. Based on this representation, we introduce the Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer (G2PT), an auto-regressive model that learns graph structures via next-token prediction. To further exploit G2PT's capabilities as a general-purpose foundation model, we explore fine-tuning strategies for two downstream applications: goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets. Results indicate that G2PT achieves superior generative performance on both generic graph and molecule datasets. Furthermore, G2PT exhibits strong adaptability and versatility in downstream tasks from molecular design to property prediction.

> In response to the increasing ransomware threat, this study presents a novel detection system that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By leveraging Sysmon logs, the system enables real-time analysis on Windows-based endpoints. Our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional models by employing batch-based incremental learning, allowing the system to continuously adapt to new ransomware variants without requiring complete retraining. The proposed model achieved an impressive average F2-score of 99.61\%, with low false positive and false negative rates of 0.17\% and 4.69\%, respectively, within a highly imbalanced dataset. This demonstrates exceptional accuracy in identifying malicious behaviour. The dynamic detection capabilities of Sysmon enhance the model's effectiveness by providing a reliable stream of security events, mitigating the vulnerabilities associated with static detection methods. Furthermore, the parallel processing of LSTM modules, combined with attention mechanisms, significantly improves training efficiency and reduces latency, making our system well-suited for real-world applications. These findings underscore the potential of our CNN-LSTM framework as a robust solution for real-time ransomware detection, ensuring adaptability and resilience in the face of evolving cyber threats.

> Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a pivotal technique for uncovering the intrinsic information within data and enhancing the interpretability of AI models. However, current state-of-the-art (sota) SR methods struggle to perform correct recovery of symbolic expressions from high-noise data. To address this issue, we introduce a novel noise-resilient SR (NRSR) method capable of recovering expressions from high-noise data. Our method leverages a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach in conjunction with a designed noise-resilient gating module (NGM) to learn symbolic selection policies. The gating module can dynamically filter the meaningless information from high-noise data, thereby demonstrating a high noise-resilient capability for the SR process. And we also design a mixed path entropy (MPE) bonus term in the RL process to increase the exploration capabilities of the policy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several popular baselines on benchmarks with high-noise data. Furthermore, our method also can achieve sota performance on benchmarks with clean data, showcasing its robustness and efficacy in SR tasks.

> In the face of increasing cyber threats, particularly ransomware attacks, there is a pressing need for advanced detection and analysis systems that adapt to evolving malware behaviours. Throughout the literature, using machine learning (ML) to obviate ransomware attacks has increased in popularity. Unfortunately, most of these proposals leverage non-incremental learning approaches that require the underlying models to be updated from scratch to detect new ransomware, wasting time and resources. This approach is problematic because it leaves sensitive data vulnerable to attack during retraining, as newly emerging ransomware strains may go undetected until the model is updated. Furthermore, most of these approaches are not designed to detect ransomware in real-time data streams, limiting their effectiveness in complex network environments. To address this challenge, we present the Sysmon Incremental Learning System for Ransomware Analysis and Detection (SILRAD), which enables continuous updates to the underlying model and effectively closes the training gap. By leveraging the capabilities of Sysmon for detailed monitoring of system activities, our approach integrates online incremental learning techniques to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of ransomware detection. The most valuable features for detection were selected using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), and concept drift detection was implemented through the ADWIN algorithm, ensuring that the model remains responsive to changes in ransomware behaviour. We compared our results to other popular techniques, such as Hoeffding Trees (HT) and Leveraging Bagging Classifier (LB), observing a detection accuracy of 98.89% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) rate of 94.11%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our technique.

> Model extraction attacks are one type of inference-time attacks that approximate the functionality and performance of a black-box victim model by launching a certain number of queries to the model and then leveraging the model's predictions to train a substitute model. These attacks pose severe security threats to production models and MLaaS platforms and could cause significant monetary losses to the model owners. A body of work has proposed to defend machine learning models against model extraction attacks, including both active defense methods that modify the model's outputs or increase the query overhead to avoid extraction and passive defense methods that detect malicious queries or leverage watermarks to perform post-verification. In this work, we introduce a new defense paradigm called attack as defense which modifies the model's output to be poisonous such that any malicious users that attempt to use the output to train a substitute model will be poisoned. To this end, we propose a novel lightweight backdoor attack method dubbed HoneypotNet that replaces the classification layer of the victim model with a honeypot layer and then fine-tunes the honeypot layer with a shadow model (to simulate model extraction) via bi-level optimization to modify its output to be poisonous while remaining the original performance. We empirically demonstrate on four commonly used benchmark datasets that HoneypotNet can inject backdoors into substitute models with a high success rate. The injected backdoor not only facilitates ownership verification but also disrupts the functionality of substitute models, serving as a significant deterrent to model extraction attacks.

> Understanding communication and information processing among brain regions of interest (ROIs) is highly dependent on long-range connectivity, which plays a crucial role in facilitating diverse functional neural integration across the entire brain. However, previous studies generally focused on the short-range dependencies within brain networks while neglecting the long-range dependencies, limiting an integrated understanding of brain-wide communication. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Long-range aware TransformER (ALTER), a brain graph transformer to capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs utilizing biased random walk. Specifically, we present a novel long-range aware strategy to explicitly capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs. By guiding the walker towards the next hop with higher correlation value, our strategy simulates the real-world brain-wide communication. Furthermore, by employing the transformer framework, ALERT adaptively integrates both short- and long-range dependencies between brain ROIs, enabling an integrated understanding of multi-level communication across the entire brain. Extensive experiments on ABIDE and ADNI datasets demonstrate that ALTER consistently outperforms generalized state-of-the-art graph learning methods (including SAN, Graphormer, GraphTrans, and LRGNN) and other graph learning based brain network analysis methods (including FBNETGEN, BrainNetGNN, BrainGNN, and BrainNETTF) in neurological disease diagnosis. Cases of long-range dependencies are also presented to further illustrate the effectiveness of ALTER. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/yushuowiki/ALTER}.

> Scripted agents have predominantly won the five previous iterations of the IEEE microRTS ($\mu$RTS) competitions hosted at CIG and CoG. Despite Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms making significant strides in real-time strategy (RTS) games, their adoption in this primarily academic competition has been limited due to the considerable training resources required and the complexity inherent in creating and debugging such agents. RAISocketAI is the first DRL agent to win the IEEE microRTS competition. In a benchmark without performance constraints, RAISocketAI regularly defeated the two prior competition winners. This first competition-winning DRL submission can be a benchmark for future microRTS competitions and a starting point for future DRL research. Iteratively fine-tuning the base policy and transfer learning to specific maps were critical to RAISocketAI's winning performance. These strategies can be used to economically train future DRL agents. Further work in Imitation Learning using Behavior Cloning and fine-tuning these models with DRL has proven promising as an efficient way to bootstrap models with demonstrated, competitive behaviors.

> Identifying the emotional state from speech is essential for the natural interaction of the machine with the speaker. However, extracting effective features for emotion recognition is difficult, as emotions are ambiguous. We propose a novel approach to learn discriminative features from variable length spectrograms for emotion recognition by cooperating softmax cross-entropy loss and center loss together. The softmax cross-entropy loss enables features from different emotion categories separable, and center loss efficiently pulls the features belonging to the same emotion category to their center. By combining the two losses together, the discriminative power will be highly enhanced, which leads to network learning more effective features for emotion recognition. As demonstrated by the experimental results, after introducing center loss, both the unweighted accuracy and weighted accuracy are improved by over 3\% on Mel-spectrogram input, and more than 4\% on Short Time Fourier Transform spectrogram input.

> Modern software systems are often highly configurable to tailor varied requirements from diverse stakeholders. Understanding the mapping between configurations and the desired performance attributes plays a fundamental role in advancing the controllability and tuning of the underlying system, yet has long been a dark hole of knowledge due to its black-box nature. While there have been previous efforts in performance analysis for these systems, they analyze the configurations as isolated data points without considering their inherent spatial relationships. This renders them incapable of interrogating many important aspects of the configuration space like local optima. In this work, we advocate a novel perspective to rethink performance analysis -- modeling the configuration space as a structured ``landscape''. To support this proposition, we designed \our, an open-source, graph data mining empowered fitness landscape analysis (FLA) framework. By applying this framework to $86$M benchmarked configurations from $32$ running workloads of $3$ real-world systems, we arrived at $6$ main findings, which together constitute a holistic picture of the landscape topography, with thorough discussions about their implications on both configuration tuning and performance modeling.

> The burgeoning landscape of text-to-image models, exemplified by innovations such as Midjourney and DALLE 3, has revolutionized content creation across diverse sectors. However, these advancements bring forth critical ethical concerns, particularly with the misuse of open-source models to generate content that violates societal norms. Addressing this, we introduce Ethical-Lens, a framework designed to facilitate the value-aligned usage of text-to-image tools without necessitating internal model revision. Ethical-Lens ensures value alignment in text-to-image models across toxicity and bias dimensions by refining user commands and rectifying model outputs. Systematic evaluation metrics, combining GPT4-V, HEIM, and FairFace scores, assess alignment capability. Our experiments reveal that Ethical-Lens enhances alignment capabilities to levels comparable with or superior to commercial models like DALLE 3, ensuring user-generated content adheres to ethical standards while maintaining image quality. This study indicates the potential of Ethical-Lens to ensure the sustainable development of open-source text-to-image tools and their beneficial integration into society.

> Transferable adversarial examples highlight the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to imperceptible perturbations across various real-world applications. While there have been notable advancements in untargeted transferable attacks, targeted transferable attacks remain a significant challenge. In this work, we focus on generative approaches for targeted transferable attacks. Current generative attacks focus on reducing overfitting to surrogate models and the source data domain, but they often overlook the importance of enhancing transferability through additional semantics. To address this issue, we introduce a novel plug-and-play module into the general generator architecture to enhance adversarial transferability. Specifically, we propose a \emph{Semantic Injection Module} (SIM) that utilizes the semantics contained in an additional guiding image to improve transferability. The guiding image provides a simple yet effective method to incorporate target semantics from the target class to create targeted and highly transferable attacks. Additionally, we propose new loss formulations that can integrate the semantic injection module more effectively for both targeted and untargeted attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments under both targeted and untargeted attack settings to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.

> Source-Free Domain Generalization (SFDG) aims to develop a model that performs on unseen domains without relying on any source domains. However, the implementation remains constrained due to the unavailability of training data. Research on SFDG focus on knowledge transfer of multi-modal models and style synthesis based on joint space of multiple modalities, thus eliminating the dependency on source domain images. However, existing works primarily work for multi-domain and less-category configuration, but performance on multi-domain and multi-category configuration is relatively poor. In addition, the efficiency of style synthesis also deteriorates in multi-category scenarios. How to efficiently synthesize sufficiently diverse data and apply it to multi-category configuration is a direction with greater practical value. In this paper, we propose a method called BatStyler, which is utilized to improve the capability of style synthesis in multi-category scenarios. BatStyler consists of two modules: Coarse Semantic Generation and Uniform Style Generation modules. The Coarse Semantic Generation module extracts coarse-grained semantics to prevent the compression of space for style diversity learning in multi-category configuration, while the Uniform Style Generation module provides a template of styles that are uniformly distributed in space and implements parallel training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits comparable performance on less-category datasets, while surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multi-category datasets.

> Continual Learning (CL) for malware classification tackles the rapidly evolving nature of malware threats and the frequent emergence of new types. Generative Replay (GR)-based CL systems utilize a generative model to produce synthetic versions of past data, which are then combined with new data to retrain the primary model. Traditional machine learning techniques in this domain often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, where a model's performance on old data degrades over time.   In this paper, we introduce a GR-based CL system that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with feature matching loss to generate high-quality malware samples. Additionally, we implement innovative selection schemes for replay samples based on the model's hidden representations.   Our comprehensive evaluation across Windows and Android malware datasets in a class-incremental learning scenario -- where new classes are introduced continuously over multiple tasks -- demonstrates substantial performance improvements over previous methods. For example, our system achieves an average accuracy of 55% on Windows malware samples, significantly outperforming other GR-based models by 28%. This study provides practical insights for advancing GR-based malware classification systems. The implementation is available at \url {https://github.com/MalwareReplayGAN/MalCL}\footnote{The code will be made public upon the presentation of the paper}.

> Mechanism design in resource allocation studies dividing limited resources among self-interested agents whose satisfaction with the allocation depends on privately held utilities. We consider the problem in a payment-free setting, with the aim of maximizing social welfare while enforcing incentive compatibility (IC), i.e., agents cannot inflate allocations by misreporting their utilities. The well-known proportional fairness (PF) mechanism achieves the maximum possible social welfare but incurs an undesirably high exploitability (the maximum unilateral inflation in utility from misreport and a measure of deviation from IC). In fact, it is known that no mechanism can achieve the maximum social welfare and exact incentive compatibility (IC) simultaneously without the use of monetary incentives (Cole et al., 2013). Motivated by this fact, we propose learning an approximate mechanism that desirably trades off the competing objectives. Our main contribution is to design an innovative neural network architecture tailored to the resource allocation problem, which we name Regularized Proportional Fairness Network (RPF-Net). RPF-Net regularizes the output of the PF mechanism by a learned function approximator of the most exploitable allocation, with the aim of reducing the incentive for any agent to misreport. We derive generalization bounds that guarantee the mechanism performance when trained under finite and out-of-distribution samples and experimentally demonstrate the merits of the proposed mechanism compared to the state-of-the-art.

> Rapid developments of AI tools are expected to offer unprecedented assistance to the research of natural science including chemistry. However, neither existing unimodal task-specific specialist models nor emerging general large multimodal models (LMM) can cover the wide range of chemical data modality and task categories. To address the real demands of chemists, a cross-modal Chemical General Intelligence (CGI) system, which serves as a truly practical and useful research assistant utilizing the great potential of LMMs, is in great need. In this work, we introduce the first Cross-modal Dialogue Foundation Model for Chemistry (ChemDFM-X). Diverse multimodal data are generated from an initial modality by approximate calculations and task-specific model predictions. This strategy creates sufficient chemical training corpora, while significantly reducing excessive expense, resulting in an instruction-tuning dataset containing 7.6M data. After instruction finetuning, ChemDFM-X is evaluated on extensive experiments of different chemical tasks with various data modalities. The results demonstrate the capacity of ChemDFM-X for multimodal and inter-modal knowledge comprehension. ChemDFM-X marks a significant milestone toward aligning all modalities in chemistry, a step closer to CGI.

- `2501.01117v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01117v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01117v1)

> This research presents a robust approach to classifying COVID-19 cough sounds using cutting-edge machine-learning techniques. Leveraging deep neural decision trees and deep neural decision forests, our methodology demonstrates consistent performance across diverse cough sound datasets. We begin with a comprehensive extraction of features to capture a wide range of audio features from individuals, whether COVID-19 positive or negative. To determine the most important features, we use recursive feature elimination along with cross-validation. Bayesian optimization fine-tunes hyper-parameters of deep neural decision tree and deep neural decision forest models. Additionally, we integrate the SMOTE during training to ensure a balanced representation of positive and negative data. Model performance refinement is achieved through threshold optimization, maximizing the ROC-AUC score. Our approach undergoes a comprehensive evaluation in five datasets: Cambridge, Coswara, COUGHVID, Virufy, and the combined Virufy with the NoCoCoDa dataset. Consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach yields notable AUC scores of 0.97, 0.98, 0.92, 0.93, 0.99, and 0.99 across the respective datasets. Merging all datasets into a combined dataset, our method, using a deep neural decision forest classifier, achieves an AUC of 0.97. Also, our study includes a comprehensive cross-datasets analysis, revealing demographic and geographic differences in the cough sounds associated with COVID-19. These differences highlight the challenges in transferring learned features across diverse datasets and underscore the potential benefits of dataset integration, improving generalizability and enhancing COVID-19 detection from audio signals.

> Efficient data selection is essential for improving the training efficiency of deep neural networks and reducing the associated annotation costs. However, traditional methods tend to be computationally expensive, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. We introduce PruneFuse, a novel method that combines pruning and network fusion to enhance data selection and accelerate network training. In PruneFuse, the original dense network is pruned to generate a smaller surrogate model that efficiently selects the most informative samples from the dataset. Once this iterative data selection selects sufficient samples, the insights learned from the pruned model are seamlessly integrated with the dense model through network fusion, providing an optimized initialization that accelerates training. Extensive experimentation on various datasets demonstrates that PruneFuse significantly reduces computational costs for data selection, achieves better performance than baselines, and accelerates the overall training process.

> Multimodal learning with incomplete modality is practical and challenging. Recently, researchers have focused on enhancing the robustness of pre-trained MultiModal Transformers (MMTs) under missing modality conditions by applying learnable prompts. However, these prompt-based methods face several limitations: (1) incomplete modalities provide restricted modal cues for task-specific inference, (2) dummy imputation for missing content causes information loss and introduces noise, and (3) static prompts are instance-agnostic, offering limited knowledge for instances with various missing conditions. To address these issues, we propose RAGPT, a novel Retrieval-AuGmented dynamic Prompt Tuning framework. RAGPT comprises three modules: (I) the multi-channel retriever, which identifies similar instances through a within-modality retrieval strategy, (II) the missing modality generator, which recovers missing information using retrieved contexts, and (III) the context-aware prompter, which captures contextual knowledge from relevant instances and generates dynamic prompts to largely enhance the MMT's robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that RAGPT consistently outperforms all competitive baselines in handling incomplete modality problems. The code of our work and prompt-based baselines is available at https://github.com/Jian-Lang/RAGPT.

> Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has been attracting attention by methods for modeling multi-turn contexts. The multi-turn input to a pretraining model implicitly assumes that the current turn and other turns are distinguished during the training process by inserting special tokens into the input sequence. This paper proposes a priority-based attention method to distinguish each turn explicitly by adding dialogue features into the attention mechanism, called Turn Emphasis with Dialogue (TED). It has a priority for each turn according to turn position and speaker information as dialogue features. It takes multi-head self-attention between turn-based vectors for multi-turn input and adjusts attention scores with the dialogue features. We evaluate TED on four typical benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that TED has high overall performance in all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP with numerous turns.

> Graphs are data structures used to represent irregular networks and are prevalent in numerous real-world applications. Previous methods directly model graph structures and achieve significant success. However, these methods encounter bottlenecks due to the inherent irregularity of graphs. An innovative solution is converting graphs into textual representations, thereby harnessing the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and comprehend graphs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of methodologies for applying LLMs to graphs, termed LLM4graph. The core of LLM4graph lies in transforming graphs into texts for LLMs to understand and analyze. Thus, we propose a novel taxonomy of LLM4graph methods in the view of the transformation. Specifically, existing methods can be divided into two paradigms: Graph2text and Graph2token, which transform graphs into texts or tokens as the input of LLMs, respectively. We point out four challenges during the transformation to systematically present existing methods in a problem-oriented perspective. For practical concerns, we provide a guideline for researchers on selecting appropriate models and LLMs for different graphs and hardware constraints. We also identify five future research directions for LLM4graph.

> Developing effective path representations has become increasingly essential across various fields within intelligent transportation. Although pre-trained path representation learning models have shown improved performance, they predominantly focus on the topological structures from single modality data, i.e., road networks, overlooking the geometric and contextual features associated with path-related images, e.g., remote sensing images. Similar to human understanding, integrating information from multiple modalities can provide a more comprehensive view, enhancing both representation accuracy and generalization. However, variations in information granularity impede the semantic alignment of road network-based paths (road paths) and image-based paths (image paths), while the heterogeneity of multi-modal data poses substantial challenges for effective fusion and utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning Framework (MM-Path), which can learn a generic path representation by integrating modalities from both road paths and image paths. To enhance the alignment of multi-modal data, we develop a multi-granularity alignment strategy that systematically associates nodes, road sub-paths, and road paths with their corresponding image patches, ensuring the synchronization of both detailed local information and broader global contexts. To address the heterogeneity of multi-modal data effectively, we introduce a graph-based cross-modal residual fusion component designed to comprehensively fuse information across different modalities and granularities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets under two downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed MM-Path. The code is available at: https://github.com/decisionintelligence/MM-Path.

> Learning from noisy labels is a critical challenge in machine learning, with vast implications for numerous real-world scenarios. While supervised contrastive learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool for navigating label noise, many existing solutions remain heuristic, often devoid of a systematic theoretical foundation for crafting robust supervised contrastive losses. To address the gap, in this paper, we propose a unified theoretical framework for robust losses under the pairwise contrastive paradigm. In particular, we for the first time derive a general robust condition for arbitrary contrastive losses, which serves as a criterion to verify the theoretical robustness of a supervised contrastive loss against label noise. The theory indicates that the popular InfoNCE loss is in fact non-robust, and accordingly inspires us to develop a robust version of InfoNCE, termed Symmetric InfoNCE (SymNCE). Moreover, we highlight that our theory is an inclusive framework that provides explanations to prior robust techniques such as nearest-neighbor (NN) sample selection and robust contrastive loss. Validation experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SymNCE against label noise.

> Privacy regulations mandate that developers must provide authentic and comprehensive privacy notices, e.g., privacy policies or labels, to inform users of their apps' privacy practices. However, due to a lack of knowledge of privacy requirements, developers often struggle to create accurate privacy notices, especially for sophisticated mobile apps with complex features and in crowded development teams. To address these challenges, we introduce Privacy Bills of Materials (PriBOM), a systematic software engineering approach that leverages different development team roles to better capture and coordinate mobile app privacy information. PriBOM facilitates transparency-centric privacy documentation and specific privacy notice creation, enabling traceability and trackability of privacy practices. We present a pre-fill of PriBOM based on static analysis and privacy notice analysis techniques. We demonstrate the perceived usefulness of PriBOM through a human evaluation with 150 diverse participants. Our findings suggest that PriBOM could serve as a significant solution for providing privacy support in DevOps for mobile apps.

> Multi-view learning (MVL) leverages multiple sources or views of data to enhance machine learning model performance and robustness. This approach has been successfully used in the Earth Observation (EO) domain, where views have a heterogeneous nature and can be affected by missing data. Despite the negative effect that missing data has on model predictions, the ML literature has used it as an augmentation technique to improve model generalization, like masking the input data. Inspired by this, we introduce novel methods for EO applications tailored to MVL with missing views. Our methods integrate the combination of a set to simulate all combinations of missing views as different training samples. Instead of replacing missing data with a numerical value, we use dynamic merge functions, like average, and more complex ones like Transformer. This allows the MVL model to entirely ignore the missing views, enhancing its predictive robustness. We experiment on four EO datasets with temporal and static views, including state-of-the-art methods from the EO domain. The results indicate that our methods improve model robustness under conditions of moderate missingness, and improve the predictive performance when all views are present. The proposed methods offer a single adaptive solution to operate effectively with any combination of available views.

> Multi-agent reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework for enabling agents to learn complex, coordinated behaviors but faces persistent challenges regarding its generalization, scalability and sample efficiency. Recent advancements have sought to alleviate those issues by embedding intrinsic symmetries of the systems in the policy. Yet, most dynamical systems exhibit little to no symmetries to exploit. This paper presents a novel framework for embedding extrinsic symmetries in multi-agent system dynamics that enables the use of symmetry-enhanced methods to address systems with insufficient intrinsic symmetries, expanding the scope of equivariant learning to a wide variety of MARL problems. Central to our framework is the Group Equivariant Graphormer, a group-modular architecture specifically designed for distributed swarming tasks. Extensive experiments on a swarm of symmetry-breaking quadrotors validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its potential for improved generalization and zero-shot scalability. Our method achieves significant reductions in collision rates and enhances task success rates across a diverse range of scenarios and varying swarm sizes.

> This survey gives an overview of Monte Carlo methodologies using surrogate models, for dealing with densities which are intractable, costly, and/or noisy. This type of problem can be found in numerous real-world scenarios, including stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning, where each evaluation of a density function may incur some computationally-expensive or even physical (real-world activity) cost, likely to give different results each time. The surrogate model does not incur this cost, but there are important trade-offs and considerations involved in the choice and design of such methodologies. We classify the different methodologies into three main classes and describe specific instances of algorithms under a unified notation. A modular scheme which encompasses the considered methods is also presented. A range of application scenarios is discussed, with special attention to the likelihood-free setting and reinforcement learning. Several numerical comparisons are also provided.

> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in various natural language processing tasks. However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.

> Factorization machine (FM) variants are widely used for large scale real-time content recommendation systems, since they offer an excellent balance between model accuracy and low computational costs for training and inference. These systems are trained on tabular data with both numerical and categorical columns. Incorporating numerical columns poses a challenge, and they are typically incorporated using a scalar transformation or binning, which can be either learned or chosen a-priori. In this work, we provide a systematic and theoretically-justified way to incorporate numerical features into FM variants by encoding them into a vector of function values for a set of functions of one's choice.   We view factorization machines as approximators of segmentized functions, namely, functions from a field's value to the real numbers, assuming the remaining fields are assigned some given constants, which we refer to as the segment. From this perspective, we show that our technique yields a model that learns segmentized functions of the numerical feature spanned by the set of functions of one's choice, namely, the spanning coefficients vary between segments. Hence, to improve model accuracy we advocate the use of functions known to have strong approximation power, and offer the B-Spline basis due to its well-known approximation power, availability in software libraries, and efficiency. Our technique preserves fast training and inference, and requires only a small modification of the computational graph of an FM model. Therefore, it is easy to incorporate into an existing system to improve its performance. Finally, we back our claims with a set of experiments, including synthetic, performance evaluation on several data-sets, and an A/B test on a real online advertising system which shows improved performance.

> Text clustering remains valuable in real-world applications where manual labeling is cost-prohibitive. It facilitates efficient organization and analysis of information by grouping similar texts based on their representations. However, implementing this approach necessitates fine-tuned embedders for downstream data and sophisticated similarity metrics. To address this issue, this study presents a novel framework for text clustering that effectively leverages the in-context learning capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of fine-tuning embedders, we propose to transform the text clustering into a classification task via LLM. First, we prompt LLM to generate potential labels for a given dataset. Second, after integrating similar labels generated by the LLM, we prompt the LLM to assign the most appropriate label to each sample in the dataset. Our framework has been experimentally proven to achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art clustering methods that employ embeddings, without requiring complex fine-tuning or clustering algorithms. We make our code available to the public for utilization at https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/Text-Clustering-via-LLM.

> In this paper we address the problem of performing Bayesian inference for the parameters of a nonlinear multi-output model and the covariance matrix of the different output signals. We propose an adaptive importance sampling (AIS) scheme for multivariate Bayesian inversion problems, which is based in two main ideas: the variables of interest are split in two blocks and the inference takes advantage of known analytical optimization formulas. We estimate both the unknown parameters of the multivariate non-linear model and the covariance matrix of the noise. In the first part of the proposed inference scheme, a novel AIS technique called adaptive target adaptive importance sampling (ATAIS) is designed, which alternates iteratively between an IS technique over the parameters of the non-linear model and a frequentist approach for the covariance matrix of the noise. In the second part of the proposed inference scheme, a prior density over the covariance matrix is considered and the cloud of samples obtained by ATAIS are recycled and re-weighted to obtain a complete Bayesian study over the model parameters and covariance matrix. ATAIS is the main contribution of the work. Additionally, the inverted layered importance sampling (ILIS) is presented as a possible compelling algorithm (but based on a conceptually simpler idea). Different numerical examples show the benefits of the proposed approaches

> While generative models such as text-to-image, large language models and text-to-video have seen significant progress, the extension to text-to-virtual-reality remains largely unexplored, due to a deficit in training data and the complexity of achieving realistic depth and motion in virtual environments. This paper proposes an approach to coalesce existing generative systems to form a stereoscopic virtual reality video from text.   Carried out in three main stages, we start with a base text-to-image model that captures context from an input text. We then employ Stable Diffusion on the rudimentary image produced, to generate frames with enhanced realism and overall quality. These frames are processed with depth estimation algorithms to create left-eye and right-eye views, which are stitched side-by-side to create an immersive viewing experience. Such systems would be highly beneficial in virtual reality production, since filming and scene building often require extensive hours of work and post-production effort.   We utilize image evaluation techniques, specifically Fr\'echet Inception Distance and CLIP Score, to assess the visual quality of frames produced for the video. These quantitative measures establish the proficiency of the proposed method.   Our work highlights the exciting possibilities of using natural language-driven graphics in fields like virtual reality simulations.

> Lung ultrasound is a growing modality in clinics for diagnosing and monitoring acute and chronic lung diseases due to its low cost and accessibility. Lung ultrasound works by emitting diagnostic pulses, receiving pressure waves and converting them into radio frequency (RF) data, which are then processed into B-mode images with beamformers for radiologists to interpret. However, unlike conventional ultrasound for soft tissue anatomical imaging, lung ultrasound interpretation is complicated by complex reverberations from the pleural interface caused by the inability of ultrasound to penetrate air. The indirect B-mode images make interpretation highly dependent on reader expertise, requiring years of training, which limits its widespread use despite its potential for high accuracy in skilled hands.   To address these challenges and democratize ultrasound lung imaging as a reliable diagnostic tool, we propose LUNA, an AI model that directly reconstructs lung aeration maps from RF data, bypassing the need for traditional beamformers and indirect interpretation of B-mode images. LUNA uses a Fourier neural operator, which processes RF data efficiently in Fourier space, enabling accurate reconstruction of lung aeration maps. LUNA offers a quantitative, reader-independent alternative to traditional semi-quantitative lung ultrasound scoring methods. The development of LUNA involves synthetic and real data: We simulate synthetic data with an experimentally validated approach and scan ex vivo swine lungs as real data. Trained on abundant simulated data and fine-tuned with a small amount of real-world data, LUNA achieves robust performance, demonstrated by an aeration estimation error of 9% in ex-vivo lung scans. We demonstrate the potential of reconstructing lung aeration maps from RF data, providing a foundation for improving lung ultrasound reproducibility and diagnostic utility.

> This study focuses on a method for detecting and classifying distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, such as SYN Flooding, ACK Flooding, HTTP Flooding, and UDP Flooding, using neural networks. Machine learning, particularly neural networks, is highly effective in detecting malicious traffic. A dataset containing normal traffic and various DDoS attacks was used to train a neural network model with a 24-106-5 architecture. The model achieved high Accuracy (99.35%), Precision (99.32%), Recall (99.54%), and F-score (0.99) in the classification task. All major attack types were correctly identified. The model was also further tested in the lab using virtual infrastructures to generate normal and DDoS traffic. The results showed that the model can accurately classify attacks under near-real-world conditions, demonstrating 95.05% accuracy and balanced F-score scores for all attack types. This confirms that neural networks are an effective tool for detecting DDoS attacks in modern information security systems.

> Palmprint recognition has emerged as a prominent biometric technology, widely applied in diverse scenarios. Traditional handcrafted methods for palmprint recognition often fall short in representation capability, as they heavily depend on researchers' prior knowledge. Deep learning (DL) has been introduced to address this limitation, leveraging its remarkable successes across various domains.

This paper bridges that gap by thoroughly reviewing recent advancements in DL-powered palmprint recognition. The paper systematically examines progress across key tasks, including region-of-interest segmentation, feature extraction, and security/privacy-oriented challenges. Beyond highlighting these advancements, the paper identifies current challenges and uncovers promising opportunities for future research. By consolidating state-of-the-art progress, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, enabling them to stay abreast of cutting-edge technologies and drive innovation in palmprint recognition.

- `2307.15398v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15398v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15398v5)

> We investigate the role of the initial screening order (ISO) in candidate screening. The ISO refers to the order in which the screener searches the candidate pool when selecting $k$ candidates. Today, it is common for the ISO to be the product of an information access system, such as an online platform or a database query. The ISO has been largely overlooked in the literature, despite its impact on the optimality and fairness of the selected $k$ candidates, especially under a human screener. We define two problem formulations describing the search behavior of the screener given an ISO: the best-$k$, where it selects the top $k$ candidates; and the good-$k$, where it selects the first good-enough $k$ candidates. To study the impact of the ISO, we introduce a human-like screener and compare it to its algorithmic counterpart, where the human-like screener is conceived to be inconsistent over time. Our analysis, in particular, shows that the ISO, under a human-like screener solving for the good-$k$ problem, hinders individual fairness despite meeting group fairness, and hampers the optimality of the selected $k$ candidates. This is due to position bias, where a candidate's evaluation is affected by its position within the ISO. We report extensive simulated experiments exploring the parameters of the best-$k$ and good-$k$ problems for both screeners. Our simulation framework is flexible enough to account for multiple candidate screening tasks, being an alternative to running real-world procedures.

> While 2D pose estimation has advanced our ability to interpret body movements in animals and primates, it is limited by the lack of depth information, constraining its application range. 3D pose estimation provides a more comprehensive solution by incorporating spatial depth, yet creating extensive 3D pose datasets for animals is challenging due to their dynamic and unpredictable behaviours in natural settings. To address this, we propose a hybrid approach that utilizes rigged avatars and the pipeline to generate synthetic datasets to acquire the necessary 3D annotations for training. Our method introduces a simple attention-based MLP network for converting 2D poses to 3D, designed to be independent of the input image to ensure scalability for poses in natural environments. Additionally, we identify that existing anatomical keypoint detectors are insufficient for accurate pose retargeting onto arbitrary avatars. To overcome this, we present a lookup table based on a deep pose estimation method using a synthetic collection of diverse actions rigged avatars perform. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this lookup table-based retargeting approach. Overall, we propose a comprehensive framework with systematically synthesized datasets for lifting poses from 2D to 3D and then utilize this to re-target motion from wild settings onto arbitrary avatars.

<summary>2025-01-02 10:10:23 - Improving Graph Neural Network Training Efficiency By Using Top Non-Robust Samples In The Training Set</summary>

- *Yongyu Wang*

- `2412.14738v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14738v4)

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise from both the graph structure and the data features, which can significantly degrade their performance in common tasks such as classification and prediction. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for constructing training sets by identifying training samples that are particularly sensitive to noise for a given model. These samples are then used to enhance the model's ability to handle noise-prone instances effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve training efficiency.

> While transformers demonstrate outstanding performance across various audio tasks, their application to neural vocoders remains challenging. Neural vocoders require the generation of long audio signals at the sample level, which demands high temporal resolution. This results in significant computational costs for attention map generation and limits their ability to efficiently process both global and local information. Additionally, the sequential nature of sample generation in neural vocoders poses difficulties for real-time processing, making the direct adoption of transformers impractical. To address these challenges, we propose RingFormer, a neural vocoder that incorporates the ring attention mechanism into a lightweight transformer variant, the convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer). Ring attention effectively captures local details while integrating global information, making it well-suited for processing long sequences and enabling real-time audio generation. RingFormer is trained using adversarial training with two discriminators. The proposed model is applied to the decoder of the text-to-speech model VITS and compared with state-of-the-art vocoders such as HiFi-GAN, iSTFT-Net, and BigVGAN under identical conditions using various objective and subjective metrics. Experimental results show that RingFormer achieves comparable or superior performance to existing models, particularly excelling in real-time audio generation. Our code and audio samples are available on GitHub.

- `2501.01183v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01183v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01183v1)

> Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-risking condition characterized by bleeding within the brain parenchyma. ICU readmission in ICH patients is a critical outcome, reflecting both clinical severity and resource utilization. Accurate prediction of ICU readmission risk is crucial for guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing healthcare resources. This study utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) databases, which contain comprehensive clinical and demographic data on ICU patients. Patients with ICH were identified from both databases. Various clinical, laboratory, and demographic features were extracted for analysis based on both overview literature and experts' opinions. Preprocessing methods like imputing and sampling were applied to improve the performance of our models. Machine learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost, and Random Forest, were employed to develop predictive models for ICU readmission risk. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The developed models demonstrated robust predictive accuracy for ICU readmission in ICH patients, with key predictors including demographic information, clinical parameters, and laboratory measurements. Our study provides a predictive framework for ICU readmission risk in ICH patients, which can aid in clinical decision-making and improve resource allocation in intensive care settings.

- `2501.01187v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01187v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01187v1)

> Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) enables clients to collaboratively train deep learning models without sharing private datasets, but faces privacy leakage risks due to gradient leakage attacks. Prevailing methods leverage secure aggregation strategies to enhance PPML, where clients leverage masks and secret sharing to further protect gradient data while tolerating participant dropouts. These methods, however, require frequent inter-client communication to negotiate keys and perform secret sharing, leading to substantial communication overhead. To tackle this issue, we propose NET-SA, an efficient secure aggregation architecture for PPML based on in-network computing. NET-SA employs seed homomorphic pseudorandom generators for local gradient masking and utilizes programmable switches for seed aggregation. Accurate and secure gradient aggregation is then performed on the central server based on masked gradients and aggregated seeds. This design effectively reduces communication overhead due to eliminating the communication-intensive phases of seed agreement and secret sharing, with enhanced dropout tolerance due to overcoming the threshold limit of secret sharing. Extensive experiments on server clusters and Intel Tofino programmable switch demonstrate that NET-SA achieves up to 77x and 12x enhancements in runtime and 2x decrease in total client communication cost compared with state-of-the-art methods.

> Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.

> Watermarking deep neural network (DNN) models has attracted a great deal of attention and interest in recent years because of the increasing demand to protect the intellectual property of DNN models. Many practical algorithms have been proposed by covertly embedding a secret watermark into a given DNN model through either parametric/structural modulation or backdooring against intellectual property infringement from the attacker while preserving the model performance on the original task. Despite the performance of these approaches, the lack of basic research restricts the algorithmic design to either a trial-based method or a data-driven technique. This has motivated the authors in this paper to introduce a game between the model attacker and the model defender for trigger-based black-box model watermarking. For each of the two players, we construct the payoff function and determine the optimal response, which enriches the theoretical foundation of model watermarking and may inspire us to develop novel schemes in the future.

> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark. The open-sourced code is publicly available at https://github.com/titurte/FALCON.

> The development of deep learning has facilitated the application of person re-identification (ReID) technology in intelligent security. Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrians across infrared and visible modality images enabling 24-hour surveillance. Current studies relying on unsupervised modality transformations as well as inefficient embedding constraints to bridge the spectral differences between infrared and visible images, however, limit their potential performance. To tackle the limitations of the above approaches, this paper introduces a simple yet effective Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-anchor Guidance Network, named SEPG-Net. Specifically, we propose a more homogeneous spectral enhancement scheme based on frequency domain information and greyscale space, which avoids the information loss typically caused by inefficient modality transformations. Further, a Pseudo Anchor-guided Bidirectional Aggregation (PABA) loss is introduced to bridge local modality discrepancies while better preserving discriminative identity embeddings. Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEPG-Net against other state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/1024AILab/ReID-SEPG.

> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder symptoms of which includes repetitive behaviour and lack of social and communication skills. Even though these symptoms can be seen very clearly in social but a large number of individuals with ASD remain undiagnosed. In this paper, we worked on a methodology for the detection of ASD from a 3-dimensional walking video dataset, utilizing supervised machine learning (ML) classification algorithms and nature-inspired optimization algorithms for feature extraction from the dataset. The proposed methodology involves the classification of ASD using a supervised ML classification algorithm and extracting important and relevant features from the dataset using nature-inspired optimization algorithms. We also included the ranking coefficients to find the initial leading particle. This selection of particle significantly reduces the computation time and hence, improves the total efficiency and accuracy for ASD detection. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, we deployed various combinationsalgorithms of classification algorithm and nature-inspired algorithms resulting in an outstanding classification accuracy of $100\%$ using the random forest classification algorithm and gravitational search algorithm for feature selection. The application of the proposed methodology with different datasets would enhance the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methodology. Due to high accuracy and less total computation time, the proposed methodology will offer a significant contribution to the medical and academic fields, providing a foundation for future research and advancements in ASD diagnosis.

> Federated heavy hitter analytics enables service providers to better understand the preferences of cross-party users by analyzing the most frequent items. As with federated learning, it faces challenges of privacy concerns, statistical heterogeneity, and expensive communication. Local differential privacy (LDP), as the de facto standard for privacy-preserving data collection, solves the privacy challenge by letting each user perturb her data locally and report the sanitized version. However, in federated settings, applying LDP complicates the other two challenges, due to the deteriorated utility by the injected LDP noise or increasing communication/computation costs by perturbation mechanism. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel target-aligning prefix tree mechanism satisfying $\epsilon$-LDP, for federated heavy hitter analytics. In particular, we propose an adaptive extension strategy to address the inconsistencies between covering necessary prefixes and estimating heavy hitters within a party to enhance the utility. We also present a consensus-based pruning strategy that utilizes noisy prior knowledge from other parties to further align the inconsistency between finding heavy hitters in each party and providing reasonable frequency information to identify the global ones. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first solution to the federated heavy hitter analytics in a cross-party setting while satisfying the stringent $\epsilon$-LDP. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-Agent LLMs in supporting these senior design projects undertaken by engineering students, which often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework where distinct LLM agents represent different expert perspectives, such as problem formulation agents, system complexity agents, societal and ethical agents, or project managers, thus facilitating a holistic problem-solving approach. This implementation leverages standard multi-agent system (MAS) concepts such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation, incorporating prompt engineering to develop diverse personas for each agent. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues to simulate human engineering teams, guided by principles from swarm AI to efficiently balance individual contributions towards a unified solution. We adapt these techniques to create a collaboration structure for LLM agents, encouraging interdisciplinary reasoning and negotiation similar to real-world senior design projects. To assess the efficacy of this framework, we collected six proposals of engineering and computer science of...

- `2501.03259v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03259v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03259v1)

> As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama 3 become integral to educational contexts, concerns are mounting over the cultural biases, power imbalances, and ethical limitations embedded within these technologies. Though generative AI tools aim to enhance learning experiences, they often reflect values rooted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) cultural paradigms, potentially sidelining diverse global perspectives. This paper proposes a framework to assess and mitigate cultural bias within LLMs through the lens of applied multiplexity. Multiplexity, inspired by Senturk et al. and rooted in Islamic and other wisdom traditions, emphasizes the coexistence of diverse cultural viewpoints, supporting a multi-layered epistemology that integrates both empirical sciences and normative values. Our analysis reveals that LLMs frequently exhibit cultural polarization, with biases appearing in both overt responses and subtle contextual cues. To address inherent biases and incorporate multiplexity in LLMs, we propose two strategies: \textit{Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs}, which embed multiplex principles directly into the system prompt, influencing LLM outputs at a foundational level and independent of individual prompts, and \textit{Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs}, where multiple LLM agents, each representing distinct cultural viewpoints, collaboratively generate a balanced, synthesized response. Our findings demonstrate that as mitigation strategies evolve from contextual prompting to MAS-implementation, cultural inclusivity markedly improves, evidenced by a significant rise in the Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) and a PDS Entropy increase from 3.25\% at baseline to 98\% with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs. Sentiment analysis further shows a shift towards positive sentiment across cultures,...

> This paper presents Ego-Centric Intersection-over-Union (EC-IoU), addressing the limitation of the standard IoU measure in characterizing safety-related performance for object detectors in navigating contexts. Concretely, we propose a weighting mechanism to refine IoU, allowing it to assign a higher score to a prediction that covers closer points of a ground-truth object from the ego agent's perspective. The proposed EC-IoU measure can be used in typical evaluation processes to select object detectors with better safety-related performance for downstream tasks. It can also be integrated into common loss functions for model fine-tuning. While geared towards safety, our experiment with the KITTI dataset demonstrates the performance of a model trained on EC-IoU can be better than that of a variant trained on IoU in terms of mean Average Precision as well.

> Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.

> Precipitation results from complex processes across many scales, making its accurate simulation in Earth system models (ESMs) challenging. Existing post-processing methods can improve ESM simulations locally, but cannot correct errors in modelled spatial patterns. Here we propose a framework based on physically constrained generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve local distributions and spatial structure simultaneously. We apply our approach to the computationally efficient ESM CM2Mc-LPJmL. Our method outperforms existing ones in correcting local distributions, and leads to strongly improved spatial patterns especially regarding the intermittency of daily precipitation. Notably, a double-peaked Intertropical Convergence Zone, a common problem in ESMs, is removed. Enforcing a physical constraint to preserve global precipitation sums, the GAN can generalize to future climate scenarios unseen during training. Feature attribution shows that the GAN identifies regions where the ESM exhibits strong biases. Our method constitutes a general framework for correcting ESM variables and enables realistic simulations at a fraction of the computational costs.

> Deep learning models (DLMs) achieve increasingly high performance both on structured and unstructured data. They significantly extended applicability of machine learning to various domains. Their success in making predictions, detecting patterns and generating new data made significant impact on science and industry. Despite these accomplishments, DLMs are difficult to explain because of their enormous size. In this work, we propose a novel framework for post-hoc explaining and relating DLMs using redescriptions. The framework allows cohort analysis of arbitrary DLMs by identifying statistically significant redescriptions of neuron activations. It allows coupling neurons to a set of target labels or sets of descriptive attributes, relating layers within a single DLM or associating different DLMs. The proposed framework is independent of the artificial neural network architecture and can work with more complex target labels (e.g. multi-label or multi-target scenario). Additionally, it can emulate both pedagogical and decompositional approach to rule extraction. The aforementioned properties of the proposed framework can increase explainability and interpretability of arbitrary DLMs by providing different information compared to existing explainable-AI approaches.

> Interactive preference learning systems infer human preferences by presenting queries as pairs of options and collecting binary choices. Although binary choices are simple and widely used, they provide limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which are inversely related to preference strength, as an additional signal. We propose a computationally efficient method that combines choices and response times to estimate human utility functions, grounded in the EZ diffusion model from psychology. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that for queries with strong preferences, response times complement choices by providing extra information about preference strength, leading to significantly improved utility estimation. We incorporate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that using response times significantly accelerates preference learning compared to choice-only approaches.

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity across a variety of tasks. However, reasoning remains a challenge for LLMs. To improve LLMs' reasoning ability, process supervision has proven to be better than outcome supervision. In this work, we study using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate process supervision data with LLMs themselves for training them. We sample reasoning steps with an LLM and assign each step a score that captures its "relative correctness," and the LLM is then trained by minimizing weighted log-likelihood of generating the reasoning steps. This generate-then-train process is repeated iteratively until convergence.Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods considerably improve the performance of LLMs on two mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, models trained on one dataset also exhibit improved performance on the other, showing the transferability of the enhanced reasoning ability.

> Balancing predictive power and interpretability has long been a challenging research area, particularly in powerful yet complex models like neural networks, where nonlinearity obstructs direct interpretation. This paper introduces a novel approach to constructing an explainable neural network that harmonizes predictiveness and explainability. Our model, termed SparXnet, is designed as a linear combination of a sparse set of jointly learned features, each derived from a different trainable function applied to a single 1-dimensional input feature. Leveraging the ability to learn arbitrarily complex relationships, our neural network architecture enables automatic selection of a sparse set of important features, with the final prediction being a linear combination of rescaled versions of these features. We demonstrate the ability to select significant features while maintaining comparable predictive performance and direct interpretability through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. We also provide theoretical analysis on the generalization bounds of our framework, which is favorably linear in the number of selected features and only logarithmic in the number of input features. We further lift any dependence of sample complexity on the number of parameters or the architectural details under very mild conditions. Our research paves the way for further research on sparse and explainable neural networks with guarantee.

> Ensuring safety in the aviation industry is critical, even minor anomalies can lead to severe consequences. This study evaluates the performance of four different models for DP (deep learning), including: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (sRNN), on a multi-class classification task involving Commercial, Military, and Private categories using the Socrata aviation dataset of 4,864 records. The models were assessed using a classification report, confusion matrix analysis, accuracy metrics, validation loss and accuracy curves. Among the models, BLSTM achieved the highest overall accuracy of 72%, demonstrating superior performance in stability and balanced classification, while LSTM followed closely with 71%, excelling in recall for the Commercial class. CNN and sRNN exhibited lower accuracies of 67% and 69%, with significant misclassifications in the Private class. While the results highlight the strengths of BLSTM and LSTM in handling sequential dependencies and complex classification tasks, all models faced challenges with class imbalance, particularly in predicting the Military and Private categories. Addressing these limitations through data augmentation, advanced feature engineering, and ensemble learning techniques could enhance classification accuracy and robustness. This study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate architectures for domain specific tasks

> Mission-critical system, such as satellite systems, healthcare systems, and nuclear power plant control systems, undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet specific operational requirements throughout their operation. This includes Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT), which aims to ensure that the system functions correctly under real-world operational conditions. In satellite development, In-Orbit Testing (IOT) is a crucial OAT activity performed regularly and as needed after deployment in orbit to check the satellite's performance and ensure that operational requirements are met. The scheduling of an IOT campaign, which executes multiple IOT procedures, is an important yet challenging problem, as it accounts for various factors, including satellite visibility, antenna usage costs, testing time periods, and operational constraints. To address the IOT scheduling problem, we propose a multi-objective approach to generate near-optimal IOT schedules, accounting for operational costs, fragmentation (i.e., the splitting of tests), and resource efficiency, which align with practitioners' objectives for IOT scheduling. Our industrial case study with SES Techcom shows significant improvements, as follows: an average improvement of 49.4% in the cost objective, 60.4% in the fragmentation objective, and 30% in the resource usage objective, compared to our baselines. Additionally, our approach improves cost efficiency by 538% and resource usage efficiency by 39.42% compared to manually constructed schedules provided by practitioners, while requiring only 12.5% of the time needed for manual IOT scheduling.

The study examines each technique's ability to unveil latent thematic structures within the data, providing safety professionals with a systematic approach to gain actionable insights.

> Merging multiple expert models offers a promising approach for performing multi-task learning without accessing their original data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate task conflicts by sparsifying task vectors or promoting orthogonality among them. However, they overlook the fundamental requirement of model merging: ensuring the merged model performs comparably to task-specific models on respective tasks. We find these methods inevitably discard task-specific information that, while causing conflicts, is crucial for performance. Based on our findings, we frame model merging as a constrained optimization problem ($\textit{i.e.}$, minimizing the gap between the merged model and individual models, subject to the constraint of retaining shared knowledge) and solve it via adaptive projective gradient descent. Specifically, we align the merged model with individual models by decomposing and reconstituting the loss function, alleviating conflicts through $\textit{data-free}$ optimization of task vectors. To retain shared knowledge, we optimize this objective by projecting gradients within a $\textit{shared subspace}$ spanning all tasks. Moreover, we view merging coefficients as adaptive learning rates and propose a task-aware, training-free strategy. Experiments show that our plug-and-play approach consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse architectures and tasks in both vision and NLP domains.

> End-to-end image and video codecs are becoming increasingly competitive, compared to traditional compression techniques that have been developed through decades of manual engineering efforts. These trainable codecs have many advantages over traditional techniques, such as their straightforward adaptation to perceptual distortion metrics and high performance in specific fields thanks to their learning ability. However, current state-of-the-art neural codecs do not fully exploit the benefits of vector quantization and the existence of the entropy gradient in decoding devices. In this paper, we propose to leverage these two properties (vector quantization and entropy gradient) to improve the performance of off-the-shelf codecs. Firstly, we demonstrate that using non-uniform scalar quantization cannot improve performance over uniform quantization. We thus suggest using predefined optimal uniform vector quantization to improve performance. Secondly, we show that the entropy gradient, available at the decoder, is correlated with the reconstruction error gradient, which is not available at the decoder. We therefore use the former as a proxy to enhance compression performance. Our experimental results show that these approaches save between 1 to 3% of the rate for the same quality across various pretrained methods. In addition, the entropy gradient based solution improves traditional codec performance significantly as well.

> In recent years, a plethora of database management systems have surfaced to meet the demands of various scenarios. Emerging database systems, such as time-series and streaming database systems, are tailored to specific use cases requiring enhanced functionality and performance. However, as they are typically less mature, there can be bugs that either cause incorrect results or errors impacting reliability. To tackle this, we propose enhanced differential testing to uncover various bugs in emerging SQL-like database systems. The challenge is how to deal with differences of these emerging databases. Our insight is that many emerging database systems are conceptually extensions of relational database systems, making it possible to reveal logic bugs leveraging existing relational, known-reliable database systems. However, due to inevitable syntax or semantics gaps, it remains challenging to scale differential testing to various emerging database systems. We enhance differential testing for emerging database systems with three steps: (i) identifying shared clauses; (ii) extending shared clauses via mapping new features back to existing clauses of relational database systems; and (iii) generating differential inputs using extended shared clauses. We implemented our approach in a tool called SQLxDiff and applied it to four popular emerging database systems. In total, we found 57 unknown bugs, of which 17 were logic bugs and 40 were internal errors. Overall, vendors fixed 50 bugs and confirmed 5. Our results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of SQLxDiff in detecting bugs in emerging database systems, which has the potential to improve the reliability of their applications.

> Structured product data, in the form of attribute-value pairs, is essential for e-commerce platforms to support features such as faceted product search and attribute-based product comparison. However, vendors often provide unstructured product descriptions, making attribute value extraction necessary to ensure data consistency and usability. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for product attribute value extraction in few-shot scenarios. Recent research has shown that self-refinement techniques can improve the performance of LLMs on tasks such as code generation and text-to-SQL translation. For other tasks, the application of these techniques has resulted in increased costs due to processing additional tokens, without achieving any improvement in performance. This paper investigates applying two self-refinement techniques, error-based prompt rewriting and self-correction, to the product attribute value extraction task. The self-refinement techniques are evaluated across zero-shot, few-shot in-context learning, and fine-tuning scenarios using GPT-4o. The experiments show that both self-refinement techniques have only a marginal impact on the model's performance across the different scenarios, while significantly increasing processing costs. For scenarios with training data, fine-tuning yields the highest performance, while the ramp-up costs of fine-tuning are balanced out as the amount of product descriptions increases.

> Remote sensing (RS) change detection incurs a high cost because of false negatives, which are more costly than false positives. Existing frameworks, struggling to improve the Precision metric to reduce the cost of false positive, still have limitations in focusing on the change of interest, which leads to missed detections and discontinuity issues. This work tackles these issues by enhancing feature learning capabilities and integrating the frequency components of feature information, with a strategy to incrementally boost the Recall value. We propose an enhanced hybrid of CNN and Transformer network (EHCTNet) for effectively mining the change information of interest. Firstly, a dual branch feature extraction module is used to extract the multi scale features of RS images. Secondly, the frequency component of these features is exploited by a refined module I. Thirdly, an enhanced token mining module based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network is utilized to derive semantic information. Finally, the semantic change information's frequency component, beneficial for final detection, is mined from the refined module II. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EHCTNet in comprehending complex changes of interest. The visualization outcomes show that EHCTNet detects more intact and continuous changed areas and perceives more accurate neighboring distinction than state of the art models.

> Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data generation. In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative modelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.

> The representations of conditional entropy and conditional mutual information are significant in explaining the unique effects among variables. While previous studies based on conditional contrastive sampling have effectively removed information regarding discrete sensitive variables, they have not yet extended their scope to continuous cases. This paper introduces Information Subtraction, a framework designed to generate representations that preserve desired information while eliminating the undesired. We implement a generative-based architecture that outputs these representations by simultaneously maximizing an information term and minimizing another. With its flexibility in disentangling information, we can iteratively apply Information Subtraction to represent arbitrary information components between continuous variables, thereby explaining the various relationships that exist between them. Our results highlight the representations' ability to provide semantic features of conditional entropy. By subtracting sensitive and domain-specific information, our framework demonstrates effective performance in fair learning and domain generalization.

> Human action understanding is crucial for the advancement of multimodal systems. While recent developments, driven by powerful large language models (LLMs), aim to be general enough to cover a wide range of categories, they often overlook the need for more specific capabilities. In this work, we address the more challenging task of Fine-grained Action Recognition (FAR), which focuses on detailed semantic labels within shorter temporal duration (e.g., "salto backward tucked with 1 turn"). Given the high costs of annotating fine-grained labels and the substantial data needed for fine-tuning LLMs, we propose to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our framework, SeFAR, incorporates several innovative designs to tackle these challenges. Specifically, to capture sufficient visual details, we construct Dual-level temporal elements as more effective representations, based on which we design a new strong augmentation strategy for the Teacher-Student learning paradigm through involving moderate temporal perturbation. Furthermore, to handle the high uncertainty within the teacher model's predictions for FAR, we propose the Adaptive Regulation to stabilize the learning process. Experiments show that SeFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FAR datasets, FineGym and FineDiving, across various data scopes. It also outperforms other semi-supervised methods on two classical coarse-grained datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51. Further analysis and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our designs. Additionally, we show that the features extracted by our SeFAR could largely promote the ability of multimodal foundation models to understand fine-grained and domain-specific semantics.

> Active Learning (AL) for regression has been systematically under-researched due to the increased difficulty of measuring uncertainty in regression models. Since normalizing flows offer a full predictive distribution instead of a point forecast, they facilitate direct usage of known heuristics for AL like Entropy or Least-Confident sampling. However, we show that most of these heuristics do not work well for normalizing flows in pool-based AL and we need more sophisticated algorithms to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. In this work we propose BALSA, an adaptation of the BALD algorithm, tailored for regression with normalizing flows. With this work we extend current research on uncertainty quantification with normalizing flows \cite{berry2023normalizing, berry2023escaping} to real world data and pool-based AL with multiple acquisition functions and query sizes. We report SOTA results for BALSA across 4 different datasets and 2 different architectures.

> Hyperparameter optimization plays a pivotal role in enhancing the predictive performance and generalization capabilities of ML models. However, in many applications, we do not only care about predictive performance but also about additional objectives such as inference time, memory, or energy consumption. In such multi-objective scenarios, determining the importance of hyperparameters poses a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between the conflicting objectives. In this paper, we propose the first method for assessing the importance of hyperparameters in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization. Our approach leverages surrogate-based hyperparameter importance measures, i.e., fANOVA and ablation paths, to provide insights into the impact of hyperparameters on the optimization objectives. Specifically, we compute the a-priori scalarization of the objectives and determine the importance of the hyperparameters for different objective tradeoffs. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets with three different objective pairs, each combined with accuracy, namely time, demographic parity loss, and energy consumption, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. Our findings not only offer valuable guidance for hyperparameter tuning in multi-objective optimization tasks but also contribute to advancing the understanding of hyperparameter importance in complex optimization scenarios.

> In recent years, toxic content and hate speech have become widespread phenomena on the internet. Moderators of online newspapers and forums are now required, partly due to legal regulations, to carefully review and, if necessary, delete reader comments. This is a labor-intensive process. Some providers of large language models already offer solutions for automated hate speech detection or the identification of toxic content. These include GPT-4o from OpenAI, Jigsaw's (Google) Perspective API, and OpenAI's Moderation API. Based on the selected German test dataset HOCON34k, which was specifically created for developing tools to detect hate speech in reader comments of online newspapers, these solutions are compared with each other and against the HOCON34k baseline. The test dataset contains 1,592 annotated text samples. For GPT-4o, three different promptings are used, employing a Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot approach. The results of the experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o outperforms both the Perspective API and the Moderation API, and exceeds the HOCON34k baseline by approximately 5 percentage points, as measured by a combined metric of MCC and F2-score.

> In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm for solving reinforcement learning problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. Recent findings highlight that LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment. This paper is the first to investigate LLMs as in-context decision-makers under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based reinforcement learning setting that extends the classic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model by querying for preference feedback. We compare GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-Preview against nine well-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that our top-performing LLM, GPT-4 Turbo, has the zero-shot relative decision-making ability to achieve surprisingly low weak regret across all the DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithms with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of our framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs used for in-context decision-making.

> The integration of bots in Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) fosters efficiency and automation. However, their use is also associated with predatory trading and market manipulation, and can pose threats to system integrity. It is therefore essential to understand the extent of bot deployment in DLTs; despite this, current detection systems are predominantly rule-based and lack flexibility. In this study, we present a novel approach that utilizes machine learning for the detection of financial bots on the Ethereum platform. First, we systematize existing scientific literature and collect anecdotal evidence to establish a taxonomy for financial bots, comprising 7 categories and 24 subcategories. Next, we create a ground-truth dataset consisting of 133 human and 137 bot addresses. Third, we employ both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to detect bots deployed on Ethereum. The highest-performing clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an average cluster purity of 82.6%, while the highest-performing model for binary classification is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83%. Our machine learning-based detection mechanism contributes to understanding the Ethereum ecosystem dynamics by providing additional insights into the current bot landscape.

> Powered by their superior performance, deep neural networks (DNNs) have found widespread applications across various domains. Many deep learning (DL) models are now embedded in mobile apps, making them more accessible to end users through on-device DL. However, deploying on-device DL to users' smartphones simultaneously introduces several security threats. One primary threat is backdoor attacks. Extensive research has explored backdoor attacks for several years and has proposed numerous attack approaches. However, few studies have investigated backdoor attacks on DL models deployed in the real world, or they have shown obvious deficiencies in effectiveness and stealthiness. In this work, we explore more effective and stealthy backdoor attacks on real-world DL models extracted from mobile apps. Our main justification is that imperceptible and sample-specific backdoor triggers generated by DNN-based steganography can enhance the efficacy of backdoor attacks on real-world models. We first confirm the effectiveness of steganography-based backdoor attacks on four state-of-the-art DNN models. Subsequently, we systematically evaluate and analyze the stealthiness of the attacks to ensure they are difficult to perceive. Finally, we implement the backdoor attacks on real-world models and compare our approach with three baseline methods. We collect 38,387 mobile apps, extract 89 DL models from them, and analyze these models to obtain the prerequisite model information for the attacks. After identifying the target models, our approach achieves an average of 12.50% higher attack success rate than DeepPayload while better maintaining the normal performance of the models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method enables more effective, robust, and stealthy backdoor attacks on real-world models.

> Self-Correction aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and self-refine their initial responses without external feedback. However, LLMs often fail to effectively self-verify and generate correct feedback, further misleading refinement and leading to the failure of self-correction, especially in complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Program-driven Self-Correction (ProgCo). First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then, program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with real program tools.

> While exploration in single-agent reinforcement learning has been studied extensively in recent years, considerably less work has focused on its counterpart in multi-agent reinforcement learning. To address this issue, this work proposes a peer-incentivized reward function inspired by previous research on intrinsic curiosity and influence-based rewards. The \textit{PIMAEX} reward, short for Peer-Incentivized Multi-Agent Exploration, aims to improve exploration in the multi-agent setting by encouraging agents to exert influence over each other to increase the likelihood of encountering novel states. We evaluate the \textit{PIMAEX} reward in conjunction with \textit{PIMAEX-Communication}, a multi-agent training algorithm that employs a communication channel for agents to influence one another. The evaluation is conducted in the \textit{Consume/Explore} environment, a partially observable environment with deceptive rewards, specifically designed to challenge the exploration vs.\ exploitation dilemma and the credit-assignment problem. The results empirically demonstrate that agents using the \textit{PIMAEX} reward with \textit{PIMAEX-Communication} outperform those that do not.

> Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is becoming increasingly more important in times of autonomous driving and other smart industrial applications. Simultaneously a promising new approach to Reinforcement Learning arises using the inherent properties of quantum mechanics, reducing the trainable parameters of a model significantly. However, gradient-based Multi-Agent Quantum Reinforcement Learning methods often have to struggle with barren plateaus, holding them back from matching the performance of classical approaches. While gradient free Quantum Reinforcement Learning methods may alleviate some of these challenges, they too are not immune to the difficulties posed by barren plateaus. We build upon an existing approach for gradient free Quantum Reinforcement Learning and propose three genetic variations with Variational Quantum Circuits for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our genetic variations in the Coin Game environment and also compare them to classical approaches. We showed that our Variational Quantum Circuit approaches perform significantly better compared to a neural network with a similar amount of trainable parameters. Compared to the larger neural network, our approaches archive similar results using $97.88\%$ less parameters.

> The increasing complexity of modern processor and IP designs presents significant challenges in identifying and mitigating hardware flaws early in the IC design cycle. Traditional hardware fuzzing techniques, inspired by software testing, have shown promise but face scalability issues, especially at the gate-level netlist where bugs introduced during synthesis are often missed by RTL-level verification due to longer simulation times.   To address this, we introduce GraphFuzz, a graph-based hardware fuzzer designed for gate-level netlist verification. In this approach, hardware designs are modeled as graph nodes, with gate behaviors encoded as features. By leveraging graph learning algorithms, GraphFuzz efficiently detects hardware vulnerabilities by analyzing node patterns. Our evaluation across benchmark circuits and open-source processors demonstrates an average prediction accuracy of 80% and bug detection accuracy of 70%, highlighting the potential of graph-based methods for enhancing hardware verification.

> Marketing mix modeling (MMM) is a widely used method to assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and optimize marketing strategies. Bayesian MMM is an advanced approach that allows for the incorporation of prior information, uncertainty quantification, and probabilistic predictions (1). In this paper, we describe the process of building a Bayesian MMM model for the online insurance company Lemonade. We first collected data on Lemonade's marketing activities, such as online advertising, social media, and brand marketing, as well as performance data. We then used a Bayesian framework to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel on total performance, while accounting for various factors such as seasonality, market trends, and macroeconomic indicators. To validate the model, we compared its predictions with the actual performance data from A/B-testing and sliding window holdout data (2). The results showed that the predicted contribution of each marketing channel is aligned with A/B test performance and is actionable. Furthermore, we conducted several scenario analyses using convex optimization to test the sensitivity of the model to different assumptions and to evaluate the impact of changes in the marketing mix on sales. The insights gained from the model allowed Lemonade to adjust their marketing strategy and allocate their budget more effectively. Our case study demonstrates the benefits of using Bayesian MMM for marketing attribution and optimization in a data-driven company like Lemonade. The approach is flexible, interpretable, and can provide valuable insights for decision-making.

> Bone non-union is among the most severe complications associated with trauma surgery, occurring in 10-30% of cases after long bone fractures. Treating non-unions requires a high level of surgical expertise and often involves multiple revision surgeries, sometimes even leading to amputation. Thus, more accurate prognosis is crucial for patient well-being. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) hold promise for developing models to predict non-union healing, even when working with smaller datasets, a commonly encountered challenge in clinical domains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ML in identifying candidates at risk of failed non-union healing, we applied three ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and XGBoost) to the clinical dataset TRUFFLE, which includes 797 patients with long bone non-union. The models provided prediction results with 70% sensitivity, and the specificities of 66% (XGBoost), 49% (support vector machine), and 43% (logistic regression). These findings offer valuable clinical insights because they enable early identification of patients at risk of failed non-union healing after the initial surgical revision treatment protocol.

- `2501.02014v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02014v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02014v1)

> Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss and the accumulation of abnormal synuclein. PD presents both motor and non-motor symptoms that progressively impair daily functioning. The severity of these symptoms is typically assessed using the MDS-UPDRS rating scale, which is subjective and dependent on the physician's experience. Additionally, PD shares symptoms with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), complicating accurate diagnosis. To address these diagnostic challenges, we propose a machine learning-based system for differential diagnosis of PD, PSP, MSA, and healthy controls (HC). This system utilizes a kinematic feature-based hierarchical feature extraction and selection approach. Initially, 18 kinematic features are extracted, including two newly proposed features: Thumb-to-index vector velocity and acceleration, which provide insights into motor control patterns. In addition, 41 statistical features were extracted here from each kinematic feature, including some new approaches such as Average Absolute Change, Rhythm, Amplitude, Frequency, Standard Deviation of Frequency, and Slope. Feature selection is performed using One-way ANOVA to rank features, followed by Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) to identify the most relevant ones, aiming to reduce the computational complexity. The final feature set is used for classification, achieving a classification accuracy of 66.67% for each dataset and 88.89% for each patient, with particularly high performance for the MSA and HC groups using the SVM algorithm. This system shows potential as a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool in clinical practice, though further data collection and refinement are needed to enhance its reliability.

> Soft sensing of hard-to-measure variables is often crucial in industrial processes. Current practices rely heavily on conventional modeling techniques that show success in improving accuracy. However, they overlook the non-linear nature, dynamics characteristics, and non-Euclidean dependencies between complex process variables. To tackle these challenges, we present a framework known as a Knowledge discovery graph Attention Network for effective Soft sensing (KANS). Unlike the existing deep learning soft sensor models, KANS can discover the intrinsic correlations and irregular relationships between the multivariate industrial processes without a predefined topology. First, an unsupervised graph structure learning method is introduced, incorporating the cosine similarity between different sensor embedding to capture the correlations between sensors. Next, we present a graph attention-based representation learning that can compute the multivariate data parallelly to enhance the model in learning complex sensor nodes and edges. To fully explore KANS, knowledge discovery analysis has also been conducted to demonstrate the interpretability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that KANS significantly outperforms all the baselines and state-of-the-art methods in soft sensing performance. Furthermore, the analysis shows that KANS can find sensors closely related to different process variables without domain knowledge, significantly improving soft sensing accuracy.

> Higher-order sensor networks are more accurate in characterizing the nonlinear dynamics of sensory time-series data in modern industrial settings by allowing multi-node connections beyond simple pairwise graph edges. In light of this, we propose a deep spatio-temporal hypergraph convolutional neural network for soft sensing (ST-HCSS). In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes. Our results validate the superiority of ST-HCSS compared to existing state-of-the-art soft sensors, and demonstrates that the learned hypergraph feature representations aligns well with the sensor data correlations.

> Label corruption, where training samples are mislabeled due to non-expert annotation or adversarial attacks, significantly degrades model performance. Acquiring large, perfectly labeled datasets is costly, and retraining models from scratch is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Scaled Activation Projection (SAP), a novel SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)-based corrective machine unlearning algorithm. SAP mitigates label noise by identifying a small subset of trusted samples using cross-entropy loss and projecting model weights onto a clean activation space estimated using SVD on these trusted samples. This process suppresses the noise introduced in activations due to the mislabeled samples. In our experiments, we demonstrate SAP's effectiveness on synthetic noise with different settings and real-world label noise. SAP applied to the CIFAR dataset with 25% synthetic corruption show upto 6% generalization improvements. Additionally, SAP can improve the generalization over noise robust training approaches on CIFAR dataset by ~3.2% on average. Further, we observe generalization improvements of 2.31% for a Vision Transformer model trained on naturally corrupted Clothing1M.

> In the realm of time series analysis, tackling the phenomenon of concept drift poses a significant challenge. Concept drift -- characterized by the evolving statistical properties of time series data, affects the reliability and accuracy of conventional analysis models. This is particularly evident in co-evolving scenarios where interactions among variables are crucial. This paper presents Drift2Matrix, a novel framework that leverages kernel-induced self-representation for adaptive responses to concept drift in time series. Drift2Matrix employs a kernel-based learning mechanism to generate a representation matrix, encapsulating the inherent dynamics of co-evolving time series. This matrix serves as a key tool for identification and adaptation to concept drift by observing its temporal variations. Furthermore, Drift2Matrix effectively identifies prevailing patterns and offers insights into emerging trends through pattern evolution analysis. Our empirical evaluation of Drift2Matrix across various datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in handling the complexities of concept drift. This approach introduces a novel perspective in the theoretical domain of co-evolving time series analysis, enhancing adaptability and accuracy in the face of dynamic data environments.

> Despite recent advances in AI, the development of systems capable of executing complex, multi-step reasoning tasks involving multiple tools remains a significant challenge. Current benchmarks fall short in capturing the real-world complexity of tool-use reasoning, where verifying the correctness of not only the final answer but also the intermediate steps is important for evaluation, development, and identifying failures during inference time. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolComp, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate multi-step tool-use reasoning. ToolComp is developed through a collaboration between models and human annotators, featuring human-edited/verified prompts, final answers, and process supervision labels, allowing for the evaluation of both final outcomes and intermediate reasoning. Evaluation across six different model families demonstrates the challenging nature of our dataset, with the majority of models achieving less than 50% accuracy. Additionally, we generate synthetic training data to compare the performance of outcome-supervised reward models (ORMs) with process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to assess their ability to improve complex tool-use reasoning as evaluated by ToolComp. Our results show that PRMs generalize significantly better than ORMs, achieving a 19% and 11% improvement in rank@1 accuracy for ranking base and fine-tuned model trajectories, respectively. These findings highlight the critical role of process supervision in both the evaluation and training of AI models, paving the way for more robust and capable systems in complex, multi-step tool-use tasks.

- `2501.02018v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02018v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02018v1)

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks, or adversarial attacks used to illicit high risk behavior from a model. Jailbreaks have been exploited by cybercriminals and blackhat actors to cause significant harm, highlighting the critical need to safeguard widely-deployed models. Safeguarding approaches, which include fine-tuning models or having LLMs "self-reflect", may lengthen the inference time of a model, incur a computational penalty, reduce the semantic fluency of an output, and restrict ``normal'' model behavior. Importantly, these Safety-Performance Trade-offs (SPTs) remain an understudied area. In this work, we introduce a novel safeguard, called SafeNudge, that combines Controlled Text Generation with "nudging", or using text interventions to change the behavior of a model. SafeNudge triggers during text-generation while a jailbreak attack is being executed, and can reduce successful jailbreak attempts by 30% by guiding the LLM towards a safe responses. It adds minimal latency to inference and has a negligible impact on the semantic fluency of outputs. Further, we allow for tunable SPTs. SafeNudge is open-source and available through https://pypi.org/, and is compatible with models loaded with the Hugging Face "transformers" library.

- `2501.01291v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01291v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01291v1)

> Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other methods in simulations.

> Recently, the increasing deployment of LEO satellite systems has enabled various space analytics (e.g., crop and climate monitoring), which heavily relies on the advancements in deep learning (DL). However, the intermittent connectivity between LEO satellites and ground station (GS) significantly hinders the timely transmission of raw data to GS for centralized learning, while the scaled-up DL models hamper distributed learning on resource-constrained LEO satellites. Though split learning (SL) can be a potential solution to these problems by partitioning a model and offloading primary training workload to GS, the labor-intensive labeling process remains an obstacle, with intermittent connectivity and data heterogeneity being other challenges. In this paper, we propose LEO-Split, a semi-supervised (SS) SL design tailored for satellite networks to combat these challenges. Leveraging SS learning to handle (labeled) data scarcity, we construct an auxiliary model to tackle the training failure of the satellite-GS non-contact time. Moreover, we propose a pseudo-labeling algorithm to rectify data imbalances across satellites. Lastly, an adaptive activation interpolation scheme is devised to prevent the overfitting of server-side sub-model training at GS. Extensive experiments with real-world LEO satellite traces (e.g., Starlink) demonstrate that our LEO-Split framework achieves superior performance compared to state-ofthe-art benchmarks.

> Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to ground a local visual region via natural language, is a task that heavily relies on multimodal alignment. Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER. Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by an aligned prior, and Local Convolution Adapters to extract precise local semantics for better visual perception. Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that MaPPER achieves the best accuracy compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods with only 1.41% tunable backbone parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/liuting20/MaPPER.

> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting the attention of healthcare professionals for their potential to assist in diagnostic assessments, which could alleviate the strain on the healthcare system caused by a high patient load and a shortage of providers. For LLMs to be effective in supporting diagnostic assessments, it is essential that they closely replicate the standard diagnostic procedures used by clinicians. In this paper, we specifically examine the diagnostic assessment processes described in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for major depressive disorder (MDD) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We investigate various prompting and fine-tuning techniques to guide both proprietary and open-source LLMs in adhering to these processes, and we evaluate the agreement between LLM-generated diagnostic outcomes and expert-validated ground truth. For fine-tuning, we utilize the Mentalllama and Llama models, while for prompting, we experiment with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as llama-3.1-8b and mixtral-8x7b.

> Many critical decisions, such as personalized medical diagnoses and product pricing, are made based on insights gained from designing, observing, and analyzing a series of experiments. This highlights the crucial role of experimental design, which goes beyond merely collecting information on system parameters as in traditional Bayesian experimental design (BED), but also plays a key part in facilitating downstream decision-making. Most recent BED methods use an amortized policy network to rapidly design experiments. However, the information gathered through these methods is suboptimal for down-the-line decision-making, as the experiments are not inherently designed with downstream objectives in mind. In this paper, we present an amortized decision-aware BED framework that prioritizes maximizing downstream decision utility. We introduce a novel architecture, the Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP), capable of instantly proposing the next experimental design, whilst inferring the downstream decision, thus effectively amortizing both tasks within a unified workflow. We demonstrate the performance of our method across several tasks, showing that it can deliver informative designs and facilitate accurate decision-making.

> Modeling the associations between real world entities from their multivariate cross-sectional profiles can provide cues into the concerted working of these entities as a system. Several techniques have been proposed for deciphering these associations including constraint-based Bayesian structure learning (BSL) algorithms that model them as directed acyclic graphs. Benchmarking these algorithms have typically focused on assessing the variation in performance measures such as sensitivity as a function of the dimensionality represented by the number of nodes in the DAG, and sample size. The present study elucidates the importance of network topology in benchmarking exercises. More specifically, it investigates variations in sensitivity across distinct network topologies while constraining the nodes, edges, and sample-size to be identical, eliminating these as potential confounders. Sensitivity of three popular constraint-based BSL algorithms (Peter-Clarke, Grow-Shrink, Incremental Association Markov Blanket) in learning the network structure from multivariate cross-sectional profiles sampled from network models with sub-linear, linear, and super-linear DAG topologies generated using preferential attachment is investigated. Results across linear and nonlinear models revealed statistically significant $(\alpha=0.05)$ decrease in sensitivity estimates from sub-linear to super-linear topology constitutively across the three algorithms. These results are demonstrated on networks with nodes $(N_{nods}=48,64)$, noise strengths $(\sigma =3,6)$ and sample size $(N = 2^{10})$. The findings elucidate the importance of accommodating the network topology in constraint-based BSL benchmarking exercises.

> In this study, we introduce the Multi-Head Explainer (MHEX), a versatile and modular framework that enhances both the explainability and accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models. MHEX consists of three core components: an Attention Gate that dynamically highlights task-relevant features, Deep Supervision that guides early layers to capture fine-grained details pertinent to the target class, and an Equivalent Matrix that unifies refined local and global representations to generate comprehensive saliency maps. Our approach demonstrates superior compatibility, enabling effortless integration into existing residual networks like ResNet and Transformer architectures such as BERT with minimal modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets in medical imaging and text classification show that MHEX not only improves classification accuracy but also produces highly interpretable and detailed saliency scores.

> We study the classical Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem with accept/reject decisions and $T$ IID arrivals. We consider a distributional form where each arrival must fall under a finite number of possible categories, each with a deterministic resource consumption vector, but a random value distributed continuously over an interval. We develop an online algorithm that achieves $O(\log^2 T)$ regret under this model, with the only (necessary) assumption being that the probability densities are bounded away from 0. We derive a second result that achieves $O(\log T)$ regret under an additional assumption of second-order growth. To our knowledge, these are the first results achieving logarithmic-level regret in an NRM model with continuous values that do not require any kind of "non-degeneracy" assumptions. Our results are achieved via new techniques including a new method of bounding myopic regret, a "semi-fluid" relaxation of the offline allocation, and an improved bound on the "dual convergence".

> Controllability has become a crucial aspect of trustworthy machine learning, enabling learners to meet predefined targets and adapt dynamically at test time without requiring retraining as the targets shift. We provide a formal definition of controllable learning (CL), and discuss its applications in information retrieval (IR) where information needs are often complex and dynamic. The survey categorizes CL according to what is controllable (e.g., multiple objectives, user portrait, scenario adaptation), who controls (users or platforms), how control is implemented (e.g., rule-based method, Pareto optimization, hypernetwork and others), and where to implement control (e.g., pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing methods). Then, we identify challenges faced by CL across training, evaluation, task setting, and deployment in online environments. Additionally, we outline promising directions for CL in theoretical analysis, efficient computation, empowering large language models, application scenarios and evaluation frameworks.

> Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations.

> Unsupervised contrastive learning has shown significant performance improvements in recent years, often approaching or even rivaling supervised learning in various tasks. However, its learning mechanism is fundamentally different from that of supervised learning. Previous works have shown that difficult-to-learn examples (well-recognized in supervised learning as examples around the decision boundary), which are essential in supervised learning, contribute minimally in unsupervised settings. In this paper, perhaps surprisingly, we find that the direct removal of difficult-to-learn examples, although reduces the sample size, can boost the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. To uncover the reasons behind this, we develop a theoretical framework modeling the similarity between different pairs of samples. Guided by this theoretical framework, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis revealing that the presence of difficult-to-learn examples negatively affects the generalization of contrastive learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the removal of these examples, and techniques such as margin tuning and temperature scaling can enhance its generalization bounds, thereby improving performance. Empirically, we propose a simple and efficient mechanism for selecting difficult-to-learn examples and validate the effectiveness of the aforementioned methods, which substantiates the reliability of our proposed theoretical framework.

> When conducting large-scale studies that collect brain MR images from multiple facilities, the impact of differences in imaging equipment and protocols at each site cannot be ignored, and this domain gap has become a significant issue in recent years. In this study, we propose a new low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning.   In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI), SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search accuracy.

> Test cases are essential for validating the reliability and quality of software applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate useful test cases for given source code. However, the existing work primarily relies on human-written plain prompts, which often leads to suboptimal results since the performance of LLMs can be highly influenced by the prompts. Moreover, these approaches use the same prompt for all LLMs, overlooking the fact that different LLMs might be best suited to different prompts. Given the wide variety of possible prompt formulations, automatically discovering the optimal prompt for each LLM presents a significant challenge. Although there are methods on automated prompt optimization in the natural language processing field, they are hard to produce effective prompts for the test case generation task. First, the methods iteratively optimize prompts by simply combining and mutating existing ones without proper guidance, resulting in prompts that lack diversity and tend to repeat the same errors in the generated test cases. Second, the prompts are generally lack of domain contextual knowledge, limiting LLMs' performance in the task.

> This paper focuses on developing translation models and related applications for 36 Indian languages, including Assamese, Awadhi, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Braj, Bodo, Dogri, English, Konkani, Gondi, Gujarati, Hindi, Hinglish, Ho, Kannada, Kangri, Kashmiri (Arabic and Devanagari), Khasi, Mizo, Magahi, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Manipuri (Bengali and Meitei), Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sinhala, Sindhi (Arabic and Devanagari), Tamil, Tulu, Telugu, and Urdu. Achieving this requires parallel and other types of corpora for all 36 * 36 language pairs, addressing challenges like script variations, phonetic differences, and syntactic diversity. For instance, languages like Kashmiri and Sindhi, which use multiple scripts, demand script normalization for alignment, while low-resource languages such as Khasi and Santali require synthetic data augmentation to ensure sufficient coverage and quality.   To address these challenges, this work proposes strategies for corpus creation by leveraging existing resources, developing parallel datasets, generating domain-specific corpora, and utilizing synthetic data techniques. Additionally, it evaluates machine translation across various dimensions, including standard and discourse-level translation, domain-specific translation, reference-based and reference-free evaluation, error analysis, and automatic post-editing. By integrating these elements, the study establishes a comprehensive framework to improve machine translation quality and enable better cross-lingual communication in India's linguistically diverse ecosystem.

> Understanding how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and apply knowledge remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel framework, K-(CSA)^2, which categorizes LLM knowledge along two dimensions: correctness and confidence. The framework defines six categories of knowledge, ranging from highly confident correctness to confidently held misconceptions, enabling a nuanced evaluation of model comprehension beyond binary accuracy. Using this framework, we demonstrate how techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and reinforcement learning with human feedback fundamentally alter the knowledge structures of internal (pre-trained) and external (context-dependent) knowledge in LLMs. CoT particularly enhances base model performance and shows synergistic benefits when applied to aligned LLMs. Moreover, our layer-wise analysis reveals that higher layers in LLMs encode more high-confidence knowledge, while low-confidence knowledge tends to emerge in middle-to-lower layers.

> Numerous studies have investigated methods for jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful content. Typically, these methods are evaluated using datasets of malicious prompts designed to bypass security policies established by LLM providers. However, the generally broad scope and open-ended nature of existing datasets can complicate the assessment of jailbreaking effectiveness, particularly in specific domains, notably cybersecurity. To address this issue, we present and publicly release CySecBench, a comprehensive dataset containing 12662 prompts specifically designed to evaluate jailbreaking techniques in the cybersecurity domain. The dataset is organized into 10 distinct attack-type categories, featuring close-ended prompts to enable a more consistent and accurate assessment of jailbreaking attempts. Furthermore, we detail our methodology for dataset generation and filtration, which can be adapted to create similar datasets in other domains. To demonstrate the utility of CySecBench, we propose and evaluate a jailbreaking approach based on prompt obfuscation. Our experimental results show that this method successfully elicits harmful content from commercial black-box LLMs, achieving Success Rates (SRs) of 65% with ChatGPT and 88% with Gemini; in contrast, Claude demonstrated greater resilience with a jailbreaking SR of 17%. Compared to existing benchmark approaches, our method shows superior performance, highlighting the value of domain-specific evaluation datasets for assessing LLM security measures. Moreover, when evaluated using prompts from a widely used dataset (i.e., AdvBench), it achieved an SR of 78.5%, higher than the state-of-the-art methods.

> Effective process monitoring is increasingly vital in industrial automation for ensuring operational safety, necessitating both high accuracy and efficiency. Although Transformers have demonstrated success in various fields, their canonical form based on the self-attention mechanism is inadequate for process monitoring due to two primary limitations: (1) the step-wise correlations captured by self-attention mechanism are difficult to capture discriminative patterns in monitoring logs due to the lacking semantics of each step, thus compromising accuracy; (2) the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention hampers efficiency. To address these issues, we propose DeepFilter, a Transformer-style framework for process monitoring. The core innovation is an efficient filtering layer that excel capturing long-term and periodic patterns with reduced complexity. Equipping with the global filtering layer, DeepFilter enhances both accuracy and efficiency, meeting the stringent demands of process monitoring. Experimental results on real-world process monitoring datasets validate DeepFilter's superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

> Tabular data is prevalent across diverse domains in machine learning. While classical methods like tree-based models have long been effective, Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based methods have recently demonstrated promising performance. However, the diverse characteristics of methods and the inherent heterogeneity of tabular datasets make understanding and interpreting tabular methods both challenging and prone to unstable observations. In this paper, we conduct in-depth evaluations and comprehensive analyses of tabular methods, with a particular focus on DNN-based models, using a benchmark of over 300 tabular datasets spanning a wide range of task types, sizes, and domains. First, we perform an extensive comparison of 32 state-of-the-art deep and tree-based methods, evaluating their average performance across multiple criteria. Although method ranks vary across datasets, we empirically find that top-performing methods tend to concentrate within a small subset of tabular models, regardless of the criteria used. Next, we investigate whether the training dynamics of deep tabular models can be predicted based on dataset properties. This approach not only offers insights into the behavior of deep tabular methods but also identifies a core set of "meta-features" that reflect dataset heterogeneity. The other subset includes datasets where method ranks are consistent with the overall benchmark, acting as a reliable probe for further tabular analysis.

> Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating machine learning algorithm performance, facilitating comparison and identifying superior solutions. However, biases within datasets can lead models to learn shortcut patterns, resulting in inaccurate assessments and hindering real-world applicability. This paper addresses the issue of entity bias in relation extraction tasks, where models tend to rely on entity mentions rather than context. We propose a debiased relation extraction benchmark DREB that breaks the pseudo-correlation between entity mentions and relation types through entity replacement. DREB utilizes Bias Evaluator and PPL Evaluator to ensure low bias and high naturalness, providing a reliable and accurate assessment of model generalization in entity bias scenarios. To establish a new baseline on DREB, we introduce MixDebias, a debiasing method combining data-level and model training-level techniques. MixDebias effectively improves model performance on DREB while maintaining performance on the original dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MixDebias compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for improving the generalization ability of relation extraction models. We will release DREB and MixDebias publicly.

> We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture, frequently reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) error between 15% to 35% on select datasets. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.

> In the training of large language models, parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA optimize memory usage and reduce communication overhead and memory usage during the fine-tuning phase. However, applying such techniques directly during the pre-training phase results in poor performance, primarily because the premature implementation of low-rank training significantly reduces model accuracy. Existing methods like ReLoRA and GaLore have attempted to address this challenge by updating the low-rank subspace. However, they still fall short of achieving the accuracy of full-rank training. Specifically, ReLoRA restricts the frequency of updates to preserve optimizer states consistency, hindering its ability to closely approximate full-rank training behavior. Meanwhile, GaLore relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to approximate the full-rank space, which introduces accuracy loss during the approximation process. In this paper, we introduce SwitchLoRA, a parameter-efficient training technique that frequently and smoothly replaces the trainable parameters of LoRA adapters with alternative parameters. SwitchLoRA updates the low-rank subspace incrementally, targeting only a few dimensions at a time to minimize the impact on optimizer states. This allows a higher update frequency, thereby enhancing accuracy by enabling the updated parameters to more closely mimic full-rank behavior during the pre-training phase. Our results demonstrate that SwitchLoRA actually surpasses full-rank training, reducing perplexity from 15.23 to 15.01 on the LLaMA 1.3B model, while also cutting communication overhead by 54\% and memory usage by 13\%. Furthermore, after full fine-tuning the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model and the full-rank pre-trained model on the GLUE benchmark, the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model showed an average accuracy gain of about 1\% over the full-rank pre-trained model.

> A recent theory shows that a multi-player decentralized partially observable Markov decision process can be transformed into an equivalent single-player game, enabling the application of \citeauthor{bellman}'s principle of optimality to solve the single-player game by breaking it down into single-stage subgames. However, this approach entangles the decision variables of all players at each single-stage subgame, resulting in backups with a double-exponential complexity. This paper demonstrates how to disentangle these decision variables while maintaining optimality under hierarchical information sharing, a prominent management style in our society. To achieve this, we apply the principle of optimality to solve any single-stage subgame by breaking it down further into smaller subgames, enabling us to make single-player decisions at a time. Our approach reveals that extensive-form games always exist with solutions to a single-stage subgame, significantly reducing time complexity. Our experimental results show that the algorithms leveraging these findings can scale up to much larger multi-player games without compromising optimality.

> 3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.

> Fairness research in machine learning often centers on ensuring equitable performance of individual models. However, real-world recommendation systems are built on multiple models and even multiple stages, from candidate retrieval to scoring and serving, which raises challenges for responsible development and deployment. This system-level view, as highlighted by regulations like the EU AI Act, necessitates moving beyond auditing individual models as independent entities. We propose a holistic framework for modeling system-level fairness, focusing on the end-utility delivered to diverse user groups, and consider interactions between components such as retrieval and scoring models. We provide formal insights on the limitations of focusing solely on model-level fairness and highlight the need for alternative tools that account for heterogeneity in user preferences. To mitigate system-level disparities, we adapt closed-box optimization tools (e.g., BayesOpt) to jointly optimize utility and equity. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic and real datasets, underscoring the need for a system-level framework.

> People have a variety of preferences for how robots behave. To understand and reason about these preferences, robots aim to learn a reward function that describes how aligned robot behaviors are with a user's preferences. Good representations of a robot's behavior can significantly reduce the time and effort required for a user to teach the robot their preferences. Specifying these representations -- what "features" of the robot's behavior matter to users -- remains a difficult problem; Features learned from raw data lack semantic meaning and features learned from user data require users to engage in tedious labeling processes. Our key insight is that users tasked with customizing a robot are intrinsically motivated to produce labels through exploratory search; they explore behaviors that they find interesting and ignore behaviors that are irrelevant. To harness this novel data source of exploratory actions, we propose contrastive learning from exploratory actions (CLEA) to learn trajectory features that are aligned with features that users care about. We learned CLEA features from exploratory actions users performed in an open-ended signal design activity (N=25) with a Kuri robot, and evaluated CLEA features through a second user study with a different set of users (N=42). CLEA features outperformed self-supervised features when eliciting user preferences over four metrics: completeness, simplicity, minimality, and explainability.

In this work, we specifically target the translation challenges posed by attributive nouns in Chinese, which frequently cause ambiguities in English translation. By manually inserting the omitted particle X ('DE'). In news article titles from the Penn Chinese Discourse Treebank, we developed a targeted dataset to fine-tune Hugging Face Chinese to English translation models, specifically improving how this critical function word is handled. This focused approach not only complements the broader strategies suggested by previous studies but also offers a practical enhancement by specifically addressing a common error type in Chinese-English translation.

> Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.

> Task Arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet effective method to merge models without additional training. However, by treating entire networks as flat parameter vectors, it overlooks key structural information and is susceptible to task interference. In this paper, we study task vectors at the layer level, focusing on task layer matrices and their singular value decomposition. In particular, we concentrate on the resulting singular vectors, which we refer to as Task Singular Vectors (TSV). Recognizing that layer task matrices are often low-rank, we propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a simple procedure that compresses them to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. We further leverage this low-rank space to define a new measure of task interference based on the interaction of singular vectors from different tasks. Building on these findings, we introduce TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that combines compression with interference reduction, significantly outperforming existing methods.

> Existing Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs), which encapsulate extensive medical knowledge, demonstrate excellent capabilities in understanding medical images and responding to human queries based on these images. However, there remain challenges in visual localization in medical images, which is crucial for abnormality detection and interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a novel UMed-LVLM designed with Unveiling Medical abnormalities. Specifically, we collect a Medical Abnormalities Unveiling (MAU) dataset and propose a two-stage training method for UMed-LVLM training. To collect MAU dataset, we propose a prompt method utilizing the GPT-4V to generate diagnoses based on identified abnormal areas in medical images. Moreover, the two-stage training method includes Abnormal-Aware Instruction Tuning and Abnormal-Aware Rewarding, comprising Abnormal Localization Rewarding and Vision Relevance Rewarding. Experimental results demonstrate that our UMed-LVLM surpasses existing Med-LVLMs in identifying and understanding medical abnormality. In addition, this work shows that enhancing the abnormality detection capabilities of Med-LVLMs significantly improves their understanding of medical images and generalization capability.

> Decision trees are widely adopted machine learning models due to their simplicity and explainability. However, as training data size grows, standard methods become increasingly slow, scaling polynomially with the number of training examples. In this work, we introduce Des-q, a novel quantum algorithm to construct and retrain decision trees for regression and binary classification tasks. Assuming the data stream produces small, periodic increments of new training examples, Des-q significantly reduces the tree retraining time. Des-q achieves a logarithmic complexity in the combined total number of old and new examples, even accounting for the time needed to load the new samples into quantum-accessible memory. Our approach to grow the tree from any given node involves performing piecewise linear splits to generate multiple hyperplanes, thus partitioning the input feature space into distinct regions. To determine the suitable anchor points for these splits, we develop an efficient quantum-supervised clustering method, building upon the q-means algorithm introduced by Kerenidis et al. We benchmark the simulated version of Des-q against the state-of-the-art classical methods on multiple data sets and observe that our algorithm exhibits similar performance to the state-of-the-art decision trees while significantly speeding up the periodic tree retraining.

> Natural language serves as a common and straightforward signal for humans to interact seamlessly with machines. Recognizing the importance of this interface, the machine learning community is investing considerable effort in generating data that is semantically coherent with textual instructions. While strides have been made in text-to-data generation spanning image editing, audio synthesis, video creation, and beyond, low-resource areas characterized by expensive annotations or complex data structures, such as molecules, motion dynamics, and time series, often lack textual labels. This deficiency impedes supervised learning, thereby constraining the application of advanced generative models for text-to-data tasks. In response to these challenges in the low-resource scenario, we propose Text2Data, a novel approach that utilizes unlabeled data to understand the underlying data distribution through an unsupervised diffusion model. Subsequently, it undergoes controllable finetuning via a novel constraint optimization-based learning objective that ensures controllability and effectively counteracts catastrophic forgetting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Text2Data is able to achieve enhanced performance regarding controllability across various modalities, including molecules, motions and time series, when compared to existing baselines.

> Accurate prediction of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structure remains an unsolved challenge. Determining RNA 3D structures is crucial for understanding their functions and informing RNA-targeting drug development and synthetic biology design. The structural flexibility of RNA, which leads to scarcity of experimentally determined data, complicates computational prediction efforts. Here, we present RhoFold+, an RNA language model-based deep learning method that accurately predicts 3D structures of single-chain RNAs from sequences. By integrating an RNA language model pre-trained on ~23.7 million RNA sequences and leveraging techniques to address data scarcity, RhoFold+ offers a fully automated end-to-end pipeline for RNA 3D structure prediction. Retrospective evaluations on RNA-Puzzles and CASP15 natural RNA targets demonstrate RhoFold+'s superiority over existing methods, including human expert groups. Its efficacy and generalizability are further validated through cross-family and cross-type assessments, as well as time-censored benchmarks. Additionally, RhoFold+ predicts RNA secondary structures and inter-helical angles, providing empirically verifiable features that broaden its applicability to RNA structure and function studies.

> Open-set recognition (OSR), the identification of novel categories, can be a critical component when deploying classification models in real-world applications. Recent work has shown that familiarity-based scoring rules such as the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) or the Maximum Logit Score (MLS) are strong baselines when the closed-set accuracy is high. However, one of the potential weaknesses of familiarity-based OSR are adversarial attacks. Here, we study gradient-based adversarial attacks on familiarity scores for both types of attacks, False Familiarity and False Novelty attacks, and evaluate their effectiveness in informed and uninformed settings on TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we explore how novel and familiar samples react to adversarial attacks and formulate the adversarial reaction score as an alternative OSR scoring rule, which shows a high correlation with the MLS familiarity score.

> Graph classification plays a pivotal role in various domains, including pathology, where images can be represented as graphs.In this domain, images can be represented as graphs, where nodes might represent individual nuclei, and edges capture the spatial or functional relationships between them. Often, the overall label of the graph, such as a cancer type or disease state, is determined by patterns within smaller, localized regions of the image. This work introduces a weakly-supervised graph classification framework leveraging two subgraph extraction techniques: (1) Sliding-window approach (2) BFS-based approach. Subgraphs are processed using a Graph Attention Network (GAT), which employs attention mechanisms to identify the most informative subgraphs for classification. Weak supervision is achieved by propagating graph-level labels to subgraphs, eliminating the need for detailed subgraph annotations.

> Transformer-based models for time series forecasting (TSF) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their effectiveness and versatility. However, these models often require extensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) to achieve the best possible performance, and a unified pipeline for HPO in transformer-based TSF remains lacking. In this paper, we present one such pipeline and conduct extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer-based TSF models. These experiments are conducted on standard benchmark datasets to evaluate and compare the performance of different models, generating practical insights and examples. Our pipeline is generalizable beyond transformer-based architectures and can be applied to other SOTA models, such as Mamba and TimeMixer, as demonstrated in our experiments. The goal of this work is to provide valuable guidance to both industry practitioners and academic researchers in efficiently identifying optimal hyperparameters suited to their specific domain applications.

Materials and Methods: The proposed method, deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS), extends the deep image prior (DIP) by introducing group sparsity to frame-specific code vectors, enabling the discovery of a low-dimensional manifold for capturing temporal variations. \discus was validated using four studies: (I) simulation of a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom to demonstrate its manifold discovery capabilities, (II) comparison with compressed sensing and DIP-based methods using simulated single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image series from six distinct digital cardiac phantoms in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), (III) evaluation on retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, and (IV) evaluation on prospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, assessed via blind scoring from two expert readers. Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV). Discussion: An unsupervised image reconstruction method is presented and validated on simulated and measured data. These developments can benefit applications where acquiring fully sampled data is challenging.

> Label noise refers to incorrect labels in a dataset caused by human errors or collection defects, which is common in real-world applications and can significantly reduce the accuracy of models. This report explores how to estimate noise transition matrices and construct deep learning classifiers that are robust against label noise. In cases where the transition matrix is known, we apply forward correction and importance reweighting methods to correct the impact of label noise using the transition matrix. When the transition matrix is unknown or inaccurate, we use the anchor point assumption and T-Revision series methods to estimate or correct the noise matrix. In this study, we further improved the T-Revision method by developing T-Revision-Alpha and T-Revision-Softmax to enhance stability and robustness. Additionally, we designed and implemented two baseline classifiers, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and ResNet-18, based on the cross-entropy loss function. We compared the performance of these methods on predicting clean labels and estimating transition matrices using the FashionMINIST dataset with known noise transition matrices. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, where the noise transition matrix is unknown, we estimated the noise matrix and evaluated the ability of the methods to predict clean labels.

> Multimodal data fusion is essential for applications requiring the integration of diverse data sources, especially in the presence of incomplete or sparsely available modalities. This paper presents a comparative study of three multimodal embedding techniques, Modal Channel Attention (MCA), Zorro, and Everything at Once (EAO), to evaluate their performance on sparsely multimodal data. MCA introduces fusion embeddings for all combinations of input modalities and uses attention masking to create distinct attention channels, enabling flexible and efficient data fusion. Experiments on two datasets with four modalities each, CMU-MOSEI and TCGA, demonstrate that MCA outperforms Zorro across ranking, recall, regression, and classification tasks and outperforms EAO across regression and classification tasks. MCA achieves superior performance by maintaining robust uniformity across unimodal and fusion embeddings. While EAO performs best in ranking metrics due to its approach of forming fusion embeddings post-inference, it underperforms in downstream tasks requiring multimodal interactions. These results highlight the importance of contrasting all modality combinations in constructing embedding spaces and offers insights into the design of multimodal architectures for real-world applications with incomplete data.

> Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.

> Personalizing text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects across diverse scenes and styles is a rapidly advancing field. Current approaches often face challenges in maintaining a balance between identity preservation and alignment with the input text prompt. Some methods rely on a single textual token to represent a subject, which limits expressiveness, while others employ richer representations but disrupt the model's prior, diminishing prompt alignment. In this work, we introduce Nested Attention, a novel mechanism that injects a rich and expressive image representation into the model's existing cross-attention layers. Our key idea is to generate query-dependent subject values, derived from nested attention layers that learn to select relevant subject features for each region in the generated image. We integrate these nested layers into an encoder-based personalization method, and show that they enable high identity preservation while adhering to input text prompts. Our approach is general and can be trained on various domains. Additionally, its prior preservation allows us to combine multiple personalized subjects from different domains in a single image.

- *Seunghyun Lee, Yuqi Gu*

- `2501.01414v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01414v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01414v1)

> In the era of generative AI, deep generative models (DGMs) with latent representations have gained tremendous popularity. Despite their impressive empirical performance, the statistical properties of these models remain underexplored. DGMs are often overparametrized, non-identifiable, and uninterpretable black boxes, raising serious concerns when deploying them in high-stakes applications. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretable deep generative modeling framework for rich data types with discrete latent layers, called Deep Discrete Encoders (DDEs). A DDE is a directed graphical model with multiple binary latent layers. Theoretically, we propose transparent identifiability conditions for DDEs, which imply progressively smaller sizes of the latent layers as they go deeper. Identifiability ensures consistent parameter estimation and inspires an interpretable design of the deep architecture. Computationally, we propose a scalable estimation pipeline of a layerwise nonlinear spectral initialization followed by a penalized stochastic approximation EM algorithm. This procedure can efficiently estimate models with exponentially many latent components. Extensive simulation studies validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the proposed algorithms' excellent performance. We apply DDEs to three diverse real datasets for hierarchical topic modeling, image representation learning, response time modeling in educational testing, and obtain interpretable findings.

> Split computing ($\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep learning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak sensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers through channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on split computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods to multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase runtime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head supervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental results show that the multi-task supervised compression model either outperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of predictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets while learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our models reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of mobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.

> This work aims to predict the popularity of short videos using the videos themselves and their related features. Popularity is measured by four key engagement metrics: view count, like count, comment count, and share count. This study employs video classification models with different architectures and training methods as backbone networks to extract video modality features. Meanwhile, the cleaned video captions are incorporated into a carefully designed prompt framework, along with the video, as input for video-to-text generation models, which generate detailed text-based video content understanding. These texts are then encoded into vectors using a pre-trained BERT model. Based on the six sets of vectors mentioned above, a neural network is trained for each of the four prediction metrics. Moreover, the study conducts data mining and feature engineering based on the video and tabular data, constructing practical features such as the total frequency of hashtag appearances, the total frequency of mention appearances, video duration, frame count, frame rate, and total time online. Multiple machine learning models are trained, and the most stable model, XGBoost, is selected. Finally, the predictions from the neural network and XGBoost models are averaged to obtain the final result.

> We introduce a method for composing object-level visual prompts within a text-to-image diffusion model. Our approach addresses the task of generating semantically coherent compositions across diverse scenes and styles, similar to the versatility and expressiveness offered by text prompts. A key challenge in this task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input visual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention mechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual representations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck for layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder that captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from these complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual prompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and composition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional guidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness. Results show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that preserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the creative potential of text-to-image generation.

> The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.

> Debris disks, which consist of dust, planetesimals, planets, and gas, offer a unique window into the mineralogical composition of their parent bodies, especially during the critical phase of terrestrial planet formation spanning 10 to a few hundred million years. Observations from the $\textit{Spitzer}$ Space Telescope have unveiled thousands of debris disks, yet systematic studies remain scarce, let alone those with unsupervised clustering techniques. This study introduces $\texttt{CLUES}$ (CLustering UnsupErvised with Sequencer), a novel, non-parametric, fully-interpretable machine-learning spectral analysis tool designed to analyze and classify the spectral data of debris disks. $\texttt{CLUES}$ combines multiple unsupervised clustering methods with multi-scale distance measures to discern new groupings and trends, offering insights into compositional diversity and geophysical processes within these disks. Our analysis allows us to explore a vast parameter space in debris disk mineralogy and also offers broader applications in fields such as protoplanetary disks and solar system objects. This paper details the methodology, implementation, and initial results of $\texttt{CLUES}$, setting the stage for more detailed follow-up studies focusing on debris disk mineralogy and demographics.

> We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier.

> Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a widely used driver assistance technology for maintaining the desired speed and safe distance to the leading vehicle. This paper evaluates the security of the deep neural network (DNN) based ACC systems under runtime stealthy perception attacks that strategically inject perturbations into camera data to cause forward collisions. We present a context-aware strategy for the selection of the most critical times for triggering the attacks and a novel optimization-based method for the adaptive generation of image perturbations at runtime. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed attack using an actual vehicle, a publicly available driving dataset, and a realistic simulation platform with the control software from a production ACC system, a physical-world driving simulator, and interventions by the human driver and safety features such as Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS). Experimental results show that the proposed attack achieves 142.9 times higher success rate in causing hazards and 82.6% higher evasion rate than baselines, while being stealthy and robust to real-world factors and dynamic changes in the environment. This study highlights the role of human drivers and basic safety mechanisms in preventing attacks.

Our theory observes knowledge transfer in VQCs and provides a heuristic interpretation for the mechanism. An analytical fine-tuning method is derived to attain the optimal transition for adaptations of similar domains.

> As machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become more widespread, concerns about their environmental impact are increasing due to the resource-intensive nature of training and inference processes. Green AI advocates for reducing computational demands while still maintaining accuracy. Although various strategies for creating sustainable ML systems have been identified, their real-world implementation is still underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by studying 168 open-source ML projects on GitHub. It employs a novel large language model (LLM)-based mining mechanism to identify and analyze green strategies. The findings reveal the adoption of established tactics that offer significant environmental benefits. This provides practical insights for developers and paves the way for future automation of sustainable practices in ML systems.

> The Main Control Room of the Fermilab accelerator complex continuously gathers extensive time-series data from thousands of sensors monitoring the beam. However, unplanned events such as trips or voltage fluctuations often result in beam outages, causing operational downtime. This downtime not only consumes operator effort in diagnosing and addressing the issue but also leads to unnecessary energy consumption by idle machines awaiting beam restoration. The current threshold-based alarm system is reactive and faces challenges including frequent false alarms and inconsistent outage-cause labeling. To address these limitations, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages predictive analytics and automated labeling. Using data from $2,703$ Linac devices and $80$ operator-labeled outages, we evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including recurrent, attention-based, and linear models, for beam outage prediction. Additionally, we assess a Random Forest-based labeling system for providing consistent, confidence-scored outage annotations. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures for beam outage prediction and identify critical gaps that must be addressed to fully harness AI for transitioning downtime handling from reactive to predictive, ultimately reducing downtime and improving decision-making in accelerator management.

> Brain age is the estimate of biological age derived from neuroimaging datasets using machine learning algorithms. Increasing \textit{brain age gap} characterized by an elevated brain age relative to the chronological age can reflect increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Hence, brain age gap is a promising biomarker for monitoring brain health. However, black-box machine learning approaches to brain age gap prediction have limited practical utility. Recent studies on coVariance neural networks (VNN) have proposed a relatively transparent deep learning pipeline for neuroimaging data analyses, which possesses two key features: (i) inherent \textit{anatomically interpretablity} of derived biomarkers; and (ii) a methodologically interpretable perspective based on \textit{linkage with eigenvectors of anatomic covariance matrix}. In this paper, we apply the VNN-based approach to study brain age gap using cortical thickness features for various prevalent neurodegenerative conditions. Our results reveal distinct anatomic patterns for brain age gap in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical Parkinsonian disorders. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distinct anatomic patterns of brain age gap are linked with the differences in how VNN leverages the eigenspectrum of the anatomic covariance matrix, thus lending explainability to the reported results.

> Accelerating machine learning inference has been an active research area in recent years. In this context, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have demonstrated compelling performance by providing massive parallelism in deep neural networks (DNNs). Neural networks (NNs) are computationally intensive during inference, as they require massive amounts of multiplication and addition, which makes their implementations costly. Numerous studies have recently addressed this challenge to some extent using a combination of sparsity induction, quantization, and transformation of neurons or sub-networks into lookup tables (LUTs) on FPGAs. Gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are a high-accuracy alternative to DNNs in a wide range of regression and classification tasks, particularly for tabular datasets. The basic building block of GBDTs is a decision tree, which resembles the structure of binary decision diagrams. FPGA design flows are heavily optimized to implement such a structure efficiently. In addition to decision trees, GBDTs perform simple operations during inference, including comparison and addition. We present TreeLUT as an open-source tool for implementing GBDTs using an efficient quantization scheme, hardware architecture, and pipelining strategy. It primarily utilizes LUTs with no BRAMs or DSPs on FPGAs, resulting in high efficiency. We show the effectiveness of TreeLUT using multiple classification datasets, commonly used to evaluate ultra-low area and latency architectures. Using these benchmarks, we compare our implementation results with existing DNN and GBDT methods, such as DWN, PolyLUT-Add, NeuraLUT, LogicNets, FINN, hls4ml, and others. Our results show that TreeLUT significantly improves hardware utilization, latency, and throughput at competitive accuracy compared to previous works.

> Motivated by deep learning regimes with multiple interacting yet distinct model components, we introduce learning diagrams, graphical depictions of training setups that capture parameterized learning as data rather than code. A learning diagram compiles to a unique loss function on which component models are trained. The result of training on this loss is a collection of models whose predictions ``agree" with one another. We show that a number of popular learning setups such as few-shot multi-task learning, knowledge distillation, and multi-modal learning can be depicted as learning diagrams. We further implement learning diagrams in a library that allows users to build diagrams of PyTorch and Flux.jl models. By implementing some classic machine learning use cases, we demonstrate how learning diagrams allow practitioners to build complicated models as compositions of smaller components, identify relationships between workflows, and manipulate models during or after training. Leveraging a category theoretic framework, we introduce a rigorous semantics for learning diagrams that puts such operations on a firm mathematical foundation.

> Explainable AI (XAI) has seen a surge in recent interest with the proliferation of powerful but intractable black-box models. Moreover, XAI has come under fire for techniques that may not offer reliable explanations. As many of the methods in XAI are themselves models, adversarial examples have been prominent in the literature surrounding the effectiveness of XAI, with the objective of these examples being to alter the explanation while maintaining the output of the original model. For explanations in natural language, it is natural to use measures found in the domain of information retrieval for use with ranked lists to guide the adversarial XAI process. We show that the standard implementation of these measures are poorly suited for the comparison of explanations in adversarial XAI and amend them by using information that is discarded, the synonymity of perturbed words. This synonymity weighting produces more accurate estimates of the actual weakness of XAI methods to adversarial examples.

> In the many years since the inception of wearable sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), a wide variety of methods have been introduced and evaluated for their ability to recognize activities. Substantial gains have been made since the days of hand-crafting heuristics as features, yet, progress has seemingly stalled on many popular benchmarks, with performance falling short of what may be considered 'sufficient'-- despite the increase in computational power and scale of sensor data, as well as rising complexity in techniques being employed. The HAR community approaches a new paradigm shift, this time incorporating world knowledge from foundational models. In this paper, we take stock of sensor-based HAR -- surveying it from its beginnings to the current state of the field, and charting its future. This is accompanied by a hands-on tutorial, through which we guide practitioners in developing HAR systems for real-world application scenarios. We provide a compendium for novices and experts alike, of methods that aim at finally solving the activity recognition problem.

> We consider the problem of transfer learning in outlier detection where target abnormal data is rare. While transfer learning has been considered extensively in traditional balanced classification, the problem of transfer in outlier detection and more generally in imbalanced classification settings has received less attention. We propose a general meta-algorithm which is shown theoretically to yield strong guarantees w.r.t. to a range of changes in abnormal distribution, and at the same time amenable to practical implementation. We then investigate different instantiations of this general meta-algorithm, e.g., based on multi-layer neural networks, and show empirically that they outperform natural extensions of transfer methods for traditional balanced classification settings (which are the only solutions available at the moment).

> Large language models trained on web-scale corpora can memorize undesirable datapoints such as incorrect facts, copyrighted content or sensitive data. Recently, many machine unlearning algorithms have been proposed that aim to `erase' these datapoints from trained models -- that is, revert model behavior to be similar to a model that had never been trained on these datapoints. However, evaluating the success of unlearning algorithms remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose the RESTOR framework for machine unlearning, which evaluates the ability of unlearning algorithms to perform targeted data erasure from models, by evaluating the ability of models to forget the knowledge introduced in these data points, while simultaneously recovering the model's knowledge state had it not encountered these datapoints. RESTOR helps uncover several novel insights about popular unlearning algorithms, and the mechanisms through which they operate -- for instance, identifying that some algorithms merely emphasize forgetting, and that localizing unlearning targets can enhance unlearning performance.

> This paper discusses how to generate general graph node embeddings from knowledge graph representations. The embedded space is composed of a number of sub-features to mimic both local affinity and remote structural relevance. These sub-feature dimensions are defined by several indicators that we speculate to catch nodal similarities, such as hop-based topological patterns, the number of overlapping labels, the transitional probabilities (markov-chain probabilities), and the cluster indices computed by our recursive spectral bisection (RSB) algorithm. These measures are flattened over the one dimensional vector space into their respective sub-component ranges such that the entire set of vector similarity functions could be used for finding similar nodes. The error is defined by the sum of pairwise square differences across a randomly selected sample of graph nodes between the assumed embeddings and the ground truth estimates as our novel loss function. The ground truth is estimated to be a combination of pairwise Jaccard similarity and the number of overlapping labels. Finally, we demonstrate a multi-variate stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm to compute the weighing factors among sub-vector spaces to minimize the average error using a random sampling logic.

<summary>2025-01-02 21:00:19 - A Metasemantic-Metapragmatic Framework for Taxonomizing Multimodal Communicative Alignment</summary>

- *Eugene Yu Ji*

- `2501.01535v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01535v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01535v1)

> Drawing on contemporary pragmatist philosophy and linguistic theories on cognition, meaning, and communication, this paper presents a dynamic, metasemantic-metapragmatic taxonomy for grounding and conceptualizing human-like multimodal communicative alignment. The framework is rooted in contemporary developments of the three basic communicative capacities initially identified by American logician and pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce: iconic (sensory and perceptual qualities), indexical (contextual and sociocultural associations), and rule-like (symbolic and intuitive reasoning). Expanding on these developments, I introduce the concept of indexical contextualization and propose the principle of "contextualization directionality" for characterizing the crucial metapragmatic capacity for maintaining, navigating, or transitioning between semantic and pragmatic modes of multimodal communication. I contend that current cognitive-social computational and engineering methodologies disproportionately emphasize the semantic/metasemantic domain, overlooking the pivotal role of metapragmatic indexicality in traversing the semantic-pragmatic spectrum of communication. The framework's broader implications for intentionality, identity, affect, and ethics in within-modal and cross-modal human-machine alignment are also discussed.

> Our study introduces ResNet-L2 (RL2), a novel metric for evaluating generative models and image quality in histopathology, addressing limitations of traditional metrics, such as Frechet inception distance (FID), when the data is scarce. RL2 leverages ResNet features with a normalizing flow to calculate RMSE distance in the latent space, providing reliable assessments across diverse histopathology datasets. We evaluated the performance of RL2 on degradation types, such as blur, Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and rectangular patches, as well as diffusion processes. RL2's monotonic response to increasing degradation makes it well-suited for models that assess image quality, proving a valuable advancement for evaluating image generation techniques in histopathology. It can also be used to discard low-quality patches while sampling from a whole slide image. It is also significantly lighter and faster compared to traditional metrics and requires fewer images to give stable metric value.

> Understanding the world and explaining it with scientific theories is a central aspiration of artificial intelligence research. Proposing theories, designing experiments to test them, and then revising them based on data are fundamental to scientific discovery. Despite the significant promise of LLM-based scientific agents, no benchmarks systematically test LLM's ability to propose scientific models, collect experimental data, and revise them in light of new data. We introduce BoxingGym, a benchmark with 10 environments for systematically evaluating both experimental design (e.g. collecting data to test a scientific theory) and model discovery (e.g. proposing and revising scientific theories). To enable tractable and quantitative evaluation, we implement each environment as a generative probabilistic model with which a scientific agent can run interactive experiments. These probabilistic models are drawn from various real-world scientific domains ranging from psychology to ecology. To quantitatively evaluate a scientific agent's ability to collect informative experimental data, we compute the expected information gain (EIG), an information-theoretic quantity which measures how much an experiment reduces uncertainty about the parameters of a generative model. A good scientific theory is a concise and predictive explanation. Therefore, to quantitatively evaluate model discovery, we ask a scientific agent to explain their model and then assess whether this explanation enables another scientific agent to make reliable predictions about this environment. In addition to this explanation-based evaluation, we compute standard model evaluation metrics such as prediction errors. We find that current LLMs, such as GPT-4o, struggle with both experimental design and model discovery. We find that augmenting the LLM-based agent with an explicit statistical model does not reliably improve these results.

- *Yuechun Gu, Jiajie He, Keke Chen*

> With increasingly deployed deep neural networks in sensitive application domains, such as healthcare and security, it's essential to understand what kind of sensitive information can be inferred from these models. Most known model-targeted attacks assume attackers have learned the application domain or training data distribution to ensure successful attacks. Can removing the domain information from model APIs protect models from these attacks? This paper studies this critical problem. Unfortunately, even with minimal knowledge, i.e., accessing the model as an unnamed function without leaking the meaning of input and output, the proposed adaptive domain inference attack (ADI) can still successfully estimate relevant subsets of training data. We show that the extracted relevant data can significantly improve, for instance, the performance of model-inversion attacks. Specifically, the ADI method utilizes a concept hierarchy extracted from a collection of available public and private datasets and a novel algorithm to adaptively tune the likelihood of leaf concepts showing up in the unseen training data. We also designed a straightforward hypothesis-testing-based attack -- LDI. The ADI attack not only extracts partial training data at the concept level but also converges fastest and requires the fewest target-model accesses among all candidate methods.

- *Rasul Tutnov, Antoine Grosnit, Haitham Bou-Ammar*

- `2501.01544v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01544v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01544v1)

> Post-alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical in improving their utility, safety, and alignment with human intentions. Direct preference optimisation (DPO) has become one of the most widely used algorithms for achieving this alignment, given its ability to optimise models based on human feedback directly. However, the vast number of DPO variants in the literature has made it increasingly difficult for researchers to navigate and fully grasp the connections between these approaches. This paper introduces a unifying framework inspired by mutual information, which proposes a new loss function with flexible priors. By carefully specifying these priors, we demonstrate that many existing algorithms, such as SimPO, TDPO, SparsePO, and others, can be derived from our framework. This unification offers a clearer and more structured approach, allowing researchers to understand the relationships between different DPO variants better. We aim to simplify the landscape of DPO algorithms, making it easier for the research community to gain insights and foster further advancements in LLM alignment. Ultimately, we hope our framework can be a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable alignment techniques.

- *Benjamin Roth, Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Yuxi Xia, Saskia Kaltenbrunner, Christoph Korab*

> Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are often criticized for their inherent bias and for their lack of control, accountability, and transparency. Consequently, regulatory bodies struggle with containing this technology's potential negative side effects. High-level requirements such as fairness and robustness need to be formalized into concrete specification metrics, imperfect proxies that capture isolated aspects of the underlying requirements. Given possible trade-offs between different metrics and their vulnerability to over-optimization, integrating specification metrics in system development processes is not trivial. This paper defines specification overfitting, a scenario where systems focus excessively on specified metrics to the detriment of high-level requirements and task performance. We present an extensive literature survey to categorize how researchers propose, measure, and optimize specification metrics in several AI fields (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning). Using a keyword-based search on papers from major AI conferences and journals between 2018 and mid-2023, we identify and analyze 74 papers that propose or optimize specification metrics. We find that although most papers implicitly address specification overfitting (e.g., by reporting more than one specification metric), they rarely discuss which role specification metrics should play in system development or explicitly define the scope and assumptions behind metric formulations.

> Equivariant neural networks have been widely used in a variety of applications due to their ability to generalize well in tasks where the underlying data symmetries are known. Despite their successes, such networks can be difficult to optimize and require careful hyperparameter tuning to train successfully. In this work, we propose a novel framework for improving the optimization of such models by relaxing the hard equivariance constraint during training: We relax the equivariance constraint of the network's intermediate layers by introducing an additional non-equivariant term that we progressively constrain until we arrive at an equivariant solution. By controlling the magnitude of the activation of the additional relaxation term, we allow the model to optimize over a larger hypothesis space containing approximate equivariant networks and converge back to an equivariant solution at the end of training. We provide experimental results on different state-of-the-art network architectures, demonstrating how this training framework can result in equivariant models with improved generalization performance.

- *Dylan Sam, Marc Finzi, J. Zico Kolter*

- `2501.01558v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01558v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01558v1)

> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly relied on in AI systems, predicting when they make mistakes is crucial. While a great deal of work in the field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these representations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an API. In this paper, we extract features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using follow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as representations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. We demonstrate that training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces reliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance level (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question). Remarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate over a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In addition, we demonstrate that these extracted features can be used to evaluate more nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be used to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that has been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers question-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code. Furthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model architectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of GPT-4o-mini).

- *Aashish Cheruvu, Nathaniel Rigoni*

- `2501.02025v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02025v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02025v1)

> This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach named RealDiffFusionNet incorporating Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDE) - time series models that are robust in handling irregularly sampled data - and multi-head attention to align relevant multimodal context (image data, time invariant data, etc.) at each time point. Long short-term memory (LSTM) models were also used as a baseline. Two different datasets were used: a data from the Open-Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC) containing structured time series data of demographics and lung function with a baseline CT scan of the lungs and the second from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) containing a series of MRI scans along with demographics, physical examinations, and cognitive assessment data. An ablation study was performed to understand the role of CDEs, multimodal data, attention fusion, and interpolation strategies on model performance. When the baseline models were evaluated, the use of multimodal data resulted in an improvement in Neural CDE performance, with a lower test RMSE. Additionally, the performance of multimodal Neural CDE was also superior to multimodal LSTM. In the attention-based architectures, fusion through concatenation and rectilinear interpolation were found to improve model performance. The performance of the proposed RealDiffFusionNet was found to be superior (0.2570) to all models. For the ADNI dataset, between the Neural-CDE and LSTM models trained only on the structured data, the test RMSE were comparable (0.471 for LSTM vs. 0.4581 Neural-CDE). Furthermore, the addition of image features from patients' MRI series resulted in an improvement in performance, with a lower test RMSE (0.4372 with multimodal vs 0.4581 with structured data). RealDiffFusionNet has shown promise in utilizing CDEs and multimodal data to accurately predict disease progression.

> Many numerical algorithms in scientific computing -- particularly in areas like numerical linear algebra, PDE simulation, and inverse problems -- produce outputs that can be represented by semialgebraic functions; that is, the graph of the computed function can be described by finitely many polynomial equalities and inequalities. In this work, we introduce Semialgebraic Neural Networks (SANNs), a neural network architecture capable of representing any bounded semialgebraic function, and computing such functions up to the accuracy of a numerical ODE solver chosen by the programmer. Conceptually, we encode the graph of the learned function as the kernel of a piecewise polynomial selected from a class of functions whose roots can be evaluated using a particular homotopy continuation method. We show by construction that the SANN architecture is able to execute this continuation method, thus evaluating the learned semialgebraic function. Furthermore, the architecture can exactly represent even discontinuous semialgebraic functions by executing a continuation method on each connected component of the target function. Lastly, we provide example applications of these networks and show they can be trained with traditional deep-learning techniques.

> This study introduces SLLMBO, an innovative framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization (HPO), incorporating dynamic search space adaptability, enhanced parameter space exploitation, and a novel LLM-tree-structured parzen estimator (LLM-TPE) sampler. By addressing limitations in recent fully LLM-based methods and traditional bayesian optimization (BO), SLLMBO achieves more robust optimization. This comprehensive benchmarking evaluates multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-3.5, and Gemini-1.5-Flash, extending prior work and establishing SLLMBO as the first framework to benchmark a diverse set of LLMs for HPO. By integrating LLMs' established strengths in parameter initialization with the exploitation abilities demonstrated in this study, alongside TPE's exploration capabilities, the LLM-TPE sampler achieves a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, reduces API costs, and mitigates premature early stoppings for more effective parameter searches. Across 14 tabular tasks in classification and regression, the LLM-TPE sampler outperformed fully LLM-based methods and achieved superior results over BO methods in 9 tasks. Testing early stopping in budget-constrained scenarios demonstrated competitive performance, indicating that LLM-based methods generally benefit from extended iterations for optimal results. This work lays the foundation for future research exploring open-source LLMs, reproducibility of LLM results in HPO, and benchmarking SLLMBO on complex datasets, such as image classification, segmentation, and machine translation.

> We address the problem of federated domain generalization in an unsupervised setting for the first time. We first theoretically establish a connection between domain shift and alignment of gradients in unsupervised federated learning and show that aligning the gradients at both client and server levels can facilitate the generalization of the model to new (target) domains. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method named FedGaLA, which performs gradient alignment at the client level to encourage clients to learn domain-invariant features, as well as global gradient alignment at the server to obtain a more generalized aggregated model. To empirically evaluate our method, we perform various experiments on four commonly used multi-domain datasets, PACS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which outperforms comparable baselines. Ablation and sensitivity studies demonstrate the impact of different components and parameters in our approach. The source code is available at: https://github.com/MahdiyarMM/FedGaLA.

> The PAC-Bayesian framework has significantly advanced the understanding of statistical learning, particularly for majority voting methods. Despite its successes, its application to multi-view learning -- a setting with multiple complementary data representations -- remains underexplored. In this work, we extend PAC-Bayesian theory to multi-view learning, introducing novel generalization bounds based on R\'enyi divergence. These bounds provide an alternative to traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence-based counterparts, leveraging the flexibility of R\'enyi divergence. Furthermore, we propose first- and second-order oracle PAC-Bayesian bounds and extend the C-bound to multi-view settings. To bridge theory and practice, we design efficient self-bounding optimization algorithms that align with our theoretical results.

> The integration of machine learning (ML) into chemistry offers transformative potential in the design of molecules. However, the focus has often been on creating highly efficient predictive models, sometimes at the expense of interpretability. We leverage explainable AI techniques to explore the design of boron-based Lewis acids, which play a pivotal role in organic reactions. Using Fluoride Ion Affinity as a proxy for Lewis acidity, we developed interpretable ML models based on chemically meaningful descriptors, including ab initio features and substituent-based parameters. By constraining the chemical space to well-defined molecular scaffolds, we achieved highly accurate predictions, surpassing conventional black-box deep learning models in low-data regime. Interpretability analyses of the models unraveled the origin of Lewis acidity in these compounds and identified actionable levers to modulate it. This work bridges ML and chemist's way of thinking, demonstrating how explainable models can inspire molecular design and enhance scientific understanding of chemical reactivity.

> For anticipating critical transitions in complex dynamical systems, the recent approach of parameter-driven reservoir computing requires explicit knowledge of the bifurcation parameter. We articulate a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) and reservoir computing to address this challenge. In particular, the driving factor is detected from time series using the VAE in an unsupervised-learning fashion and the extracted information is then used as the parameter input to the reservoir computer for anticipating the critical transition. We demonstrate the power of the unsupervised learning scheme using prototypical dynamical systems including the spatiotemporal Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system. The scheme can also be extended to scenarios where the target system is driven by several independent parameters or with partial state observations.

> Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated potential in healthcare applications, yet their propensity for hallucinations -- generating medically implausible or inaccurate information -- presents substantial risks to patient care. This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.

> In recent years, quantum computing has started to demonstrate superior efficiency to classical computing. In quantum computing, quantum circuits that implement specific quantum algorithms are usually not directly executable on quantum computer hardware. Quantum circuit compilers decompose high-level quantum gates into the hardware's native gates and optimize the circuits for accuracy and performance. However, untrusted quantum compilers risk stealing original quantum designs (quantum circuits), leading to the theft of sensitive intellectual property (IP). In classical computing, logic locking is a family of techniques to secure integrated circuit (ICs) designs against reverse engineering and IP piracy. This technique involves inserting a keyed value into the circuit, ensuring the correct output is achieved only with the correct key. To address similar issues in quantum circuit protection, we propose an enhanced locking technique for quantum circuits (E-LoQ) where multiple key bits can be condensed into one key qubit. Compared to previous work that used one qubit for each key bit, our approach achieves higher security levels. We have demonstrated the practicality of our method through experiments on a set of benchmark quantum circuits. The effectiveness of E-LoQ was measured by assessing the divergence distance from the original circuit. Our results demonstrate that E-LoQ effectively conceals the function of the original quantum circuit, with an average fidelity degradation of less than 1%.

> Despite the advantage of preserving data privacy, federated learning (FL) still suffers from the straggler issue due to the limited computing resources of distributed clients and the unreliable wireless communication environment. By effectively imitating the distributed resources, digital twin (DT) shows great potential in alleviating this issue. In this paper, we leverage DT in the FL framework over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network to assist FL training process, considering malicious attacks on model updates from clients. A reputationbased client selection scheme is proposed, which accounts for client heterogeneity in multiple aspects and effectively mitigates the risks of poisoning attacks in FL systems. To minimize the total latency and energy consumption in the proposed system, we then formulate a Stackelberg game by considering clients and the server as the leader and the follower, respectively. Specifically, the leader aims to minimize the energy consumption while the objective of the follower is to minimize the total latency during FL training. The Stackelberg equilibrium is achieved to obtain the optimal solutions. We first derive the strategies for the followerlevel problem and include them in the leader-level problem which is then solved via problem decomposition. Simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed scheme.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools across various domains due to their impressive capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The ability to accurately answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs) holds significant value in education, particularly in automated tutoring systems and assessment platforms. However, adapting LLMs to handle MCQ tasks effectively remains challenging due to the hallucinations and unclear prompts. This work explores the potential of Microsoft's PHI-3\cite{Abdin2024}, a compact yet efficient LLM, for MCQ answering. Our contributions include fine-tuning the model on the TruthfulQA dataset, designing optimized prompts to enhance model performance, and evaluating using perplexity and traditional metrics like accuracy and F1 score. Results show a remarkable improvement in PHI-3.5's MCQ handling post-fine-tuning, with perplexity decreasing from 4.68 to 2.27, and accuracy rising from 62\% to 90.8\%. This research underlines the importance of efficient models in adaptive learning systems and educational assessments, paving the way for broader integration into the classroom, particularly in fields like test preparation, student feedback, and personalized learning.

However, there is still no standard benchmark that includes large-scale datasets and supports comprehensive evaluation environments. In this paper, we introduce RCAEval, an open-source benchmark that provides datasets and an evaluation environment for RCA in microservice systems. First, we introduce three comprehensive datasets comprising 735 failure cases collected from three microservice systems, covering various fault types observed in real-world failures. Second, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes fifteen reproducible baselines covering a wide range of RCA approaches, with the ability to evaluate both coarse-grained and fine-grained RCA. RCAEval is designed to support both researchers and practitioners. We hope that this ready-to-use benchmark will enable researchers and practitioners to conduct extensive analysis and pave the way for robust new solutions for RCA of microservice systems.

> In recent years, some researchers have applied diffusion models to multivariate time series anomaly detection. The partial diffusion strategy, which depends on the diffusion steps, is commonly used for anomaly detection in these models. However, different diffusion steps have an impact on the reconstruction of the original data, thereby impacting the effectiveness of anomaly detection. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named DiffGAN, which adds a generative adversarial network component to the denoiser of diffusion model. This addition allows for the simultaneous generation of noisy data and prediction of diffusion steps. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction models, experimental results demonstrate that DiffGAN achieves superior performance in anomaly detection.

- `2501.01593v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01593v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01593v1)

> Recent studies have shown that cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (c-MADRL) is under the threat of backdoor attacks. Once a backdoor trigger is observed, it will perform malicious actions leading to failures or malicious goals. However, existing backdoor attacks suffer from several issues, e.g., instant trigger patterns lack stealthiness, the backdoor is trained or activated by an additional network, or all agents are backdoored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel backdoor leverage attack against c-MADRL, BLAST, which attacks the entire multi-agent team by embedding the backdoor only in a single agent. Firstly, we introduce adversary spatiotemporal behavior patterns as the backdoor trigger rather than manual-injected fixed visual patterns or instant status and control the period to perform malicious actions. This method can guarantee the stealthiness and practicality of BLAST. Secondly, we hack the original reward function of the backdoor agent via unilateral guidance to inject BLAST, so as to achieve the \textit{leverage attack effect} that can pry open the entire multi-agent system via a single backdoor agent. We evaluate our BLAST against 3 classic c-MADRL algorithms (VDN, QMIX, and MAPPO) in 2 popular c-MADRL environments (SMAC and Pursuit), and 2 existing defense mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that BLAST can achieve a high attack success rate while maintaining a low clean performance variance rate.

- `2501.01594v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01594v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01594v1)

> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the development of conversational agents capable of generating human-like responses. Since psychiatric assessments typically involve complex conversational interactions between psychiatrists and patients, there is growing interest in developing LLM-based psychiatric assessment conversational agents (PACAs) that aim to simulate the role of psychiatrists in clinical evaluations. However, standardized methods for benchmarking the clinical appropriateness of PACAs' interaction with patients still remain underexplored. Here, we propose PSYCHE, a novel framework designed to enable the 1) clinically relevant, 2) ethically safe, 3) cost-efficient, and 4) quantitative evaluation of PACAs. This is achieved by simulating psychiatric patients based on a multi-faceted psychiatric construct that defines the simulated patients' profiles, histories, and behaviors, which PACAs are expected to assess. We validate the effectiveness of PSYCHE through a study with 10 board-certified psychiatrists, supported by an in-depth analysis of the simulated patient utterances.

- *Peilong Wang, Jason Holmes, Zhengliang Liu, Dequan Chen, Tianming Liu, Jiajian Shen, Wei Liu*

- `2412.10622v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10622v2)

> Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the recently released models.   Methods: A set of 100 multiple choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs (OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning capabilities, the correct answers in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explaining-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning capabilities. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists.   Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answers with "None of the above," all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explaining-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning capabilities of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.   Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics training and education.

> In this report, we introduce Qwen2.5, a comprehensive series of large language models (LLMs) designed to meet diverse needs. Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base and instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available. In addition, for hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both available from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier performance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding, reasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically, the open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and proprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness while performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively. Additionally, as the foundation, Qwen2.5 models have been instrumental in training specialized models such as Qwen2.5-Math, Qwen2.5-Coder, QwQ, and multimodal models.

> Static verification is a powerful method for enhancing software quality, but it demands significant human labor and resources. This is particularly true of static verifiers that reason about heap manipulating programs using an ownership logic. LLMs have shown promise in a number of software engineering activities, including code generation, test generation, proof generation for theorem provers, and specification generation for static verifiers. However, prior work has not explored how well LLMs can perform specification generation for specifications based in an ownership logic, such as separation logic. To address this gap, this paper explores OpenAI's GPT-4o model's effectiveness in generating specifications on C programs that are verifiable with VeriFast, a separation logic based static verifier. Our experiment employs three different types of user inputs as well as basic and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to assess GPT's capabilities. Our results indicate that the specifications generated by GPT-4o preserve functional behavior, but struggle to be verifiable. When the specifications are verifiable they contain redundancies. Future directions are discussed to improve the performance.

- `2412.20804v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20804v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20804v2)

> Numerical programs form the foundation of modern science and engineering, providing essential solutions to complex mathematical problems. Therefore, errors in numerical results would lead to harmful consequences, especially in safety-critical applications. Since only a few inputs may lead to substantial errors for numerical programs, it is essential to determine whether a given input could result in a significant error. Existing researchers tend to use the results of high-precision programs to assess whether there is a substantial error, which introduces three main challenges: difficulty of implementation, existence of potential faults in the detection of numerical errors, and long execution time.   To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named DELA. Our approach is based on the observation that most numerical errors stem from large condition numbers in atomic operations (such as subtraction), which then propagate and accumulate. DELA injects small perturbations into the results of individual atomic operations within the program and compares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to detect errors. We evaluate DELA with datasets from ATOMU and HSED, as well as data from a complex linear system-solving program. Experimental results demonstrate that we can detect all the significant errors that were reported by prior research. DELA shows strong alignment with high-precision programs of ATOMU and HSED, with average Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.86 and 0.61. Additionally, DELA effectively detects significant errors in complex programs, achieving correlation scores of 0.9763 and 0.8993. More importantly, in experiments with ATOMU and HSED, DELA's perturbed programs run within only 0.13% of the time needed by high-precision versions; while for the linear system-solving programs, DELA is 73.46 times faster than the high-precision programs.

> Traffic prediction is essential for intelligent transportation systems and urban computing. It aims to establish a relationship between historical traffic data X and future traffic states Y by employing various statistical or deep learning methods. However, the relations of X -> Y are often influenced by external confounders that simultaneously affect both X and Y , such as weather, accidents, and holidays. Existing deep-learning traffic prediction models adopt the classic front-door and back-door adjustments to address the confounder issue. However, these methods have limitations in addressing continuous or undefined confounders, as they depend on predefined discrete values that are often impractical in complex, real-world scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatial-Temporal sElf-superVised confoundEr learning (STEVE) model. This model introduces a basis vector approach, creating a base confounder bank to represent any confounder as a linear combination of a group of basis vectors. It also incorporates self-supervised auxiliary tasks to enhance the expressive power of the base confounder bank. Afterward, a confounder-irrelevant relation decoupling module is adopted to separate the confounder effects from direct X -> Y relations. Extensive experiments across four large-scale datasets validate our model's superior performance in handling spatial and temporal distribution shifts and underscore its adaptability to unseen confounders. Our model implementation is available at https://github.com/bigscity/STEVE_CODE.

> Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework for representing continuous signals. However, generating diverse INR weights remains challenging due to limited training data. We introduce Few-shot Implicit Function Generation, a new problem setup that aims to generate diverse yet functionally consistent INR weights from only a few examples. This is challenging because even for the same signal, the optimal INRs can vary significantly depending on their initializations. To tackle this, we propose EquiGen, a framework that can generate new INRs from limited data. The core idea is that functionally similar networks can be transformed into one another through weight permutations, forming an equivariance group. By projecting these weights into an equivariant latent space, we enable diverse generation within these groups, even with few examples. EquiGen implements this through an equivariant encoder trained via contrastive learning and smooth augmentation, an equivariance-guided diffusion process, and controlled perturbations in the equivariant subspace. Experiments on 2D image and 3D shape INR datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively generates diverse INR weights while preserving their functional properties in few-shot scenarios.

> As the last key stage of Recommender Systems (RSs), Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) is in charge of combining multiple scores predicted by Multi-Task Learning (MTL) into a final score to maximize user satisfaction, which decides the ultimate recommendation results. In recent years, to maximize long-term user satisfaction within a recommendation session, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used for MTF in large-scale RSs. However, limited by their modeling pattern, all the current RL-MTF methods can only utilize user features as the state to generate actions for each user, but unable to make use of item features and other valuable features, which leads to suboptimal results. Addressing this problem is a challenge that requires breaking through the current modeling pattern of RL-MTF. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method called Enhanced-State RL for MTF in RSs. Unlike the existing methods mentioned above, our method first defines user features, item features, and other valuable features collectively as the enhanced state; then proposes a novel actor and critic learning process to utilize the enhanced state to make much better action for each user-item pair. To the best of our knowledge, this novel modeling pattern is being proposed for the first time in the field of RL-MTF. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in a large-scale RS. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other models significantly. Enhanced-State RL has been fully deployed in our RS more than half a year, improving +3.84% user valid consumption and +0.58% user duration time compared to baseline.

> Testing deep learning (DL) systems requires extensive and diverse, yet valid, test inputs. While synthetic test input generation methods, such as metamorphic testing, are widely used for DL testing, they risk introducing invalid inputs that do not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Invalid test inputs can lead to misleading results. Hence, there is a need for automated validation of test inputs to ensure effective assessment of DL systems. In this paper, we propose a test input validation approach for vision-based DL systems. Our approach uses active learning to balance the trade-off between accuracy and the manual effort required for test input validation. Further, by employing multiple image-comparison metrics, it achieves better results in classifying valid and invalid test inputs compared to methods that rely on single metrics. We evaluate our approach using an industrial and a public-domain dataset. Our evaluation shows that our multi-metric, active learning-based approach produces several optimal accuracy-effort trade-offs, including those deemed practical and desirable by our industry partner. Furthermore, provided with the same level of manual effort, our approach is significantly more accurate than two state-of-the-art test input validation methods, achieving an average accuracy of 97%. Specifically, the use of multiple metrics, rather than a single metric, results in an average improvement of at least 5.4% in overall accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Incorporating an active learning loop for test input validation yields an additional 7.5% improvement in average accuracy, bringing the overall average improvement of our approach to at least 12.9% compared to the baselines.

> As the last critical stage of RSs, Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) is responsible for combining multiple scores outputted by Multi-Task Learning (MTL) into a final score to maximize user satisfaction, which determines the ultimate recommendation results. Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction within a recommendation session, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in the industry. However, the offline RL algorithms used for MTF so far have the following severe problems: 1) to avoid out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage their performance; 2) they are unaware of the exploration policy used for producing training data and never interact with real environment, so only suboptimal policy can be learned; 3) the traditional exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel method named IntegratedRL-MTF customized for MTF in large-scale RSs. IntegratedRL-MTF integrates offline RL model with our online exploration policy to relax overstrict and complicated constraints, which significantly improves its performance. We also design an extremely efficient exploration policy, which eliminates low-value exploration space and focuses on exploring potential high-value state-action pairs. Moreover, we adopt progressive training mode to further enhance our model's performance with the help of our exploration policy. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in the short video channel of Tencent News. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other models remarkably. IntegratedRL-MTF has been fully deployed in our RS and other large-scale RSs in Tencent, which have achieved significant improvements.

> Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models remains a critical challenge in artificial intelligence. We introduce RDoLT, Recursive Decomposition of Logical Thought prompting, a novel framework that significantly boosts LLM reasoning performance. RDoLT is built on three key innovations: (1) recursively breaking down complex reasoning tasks into sub-tasks of progressive complexity; (2) employing an advanced selection and scoring mechanism to identify the most promising reasoning thoughts; and (3) integrating a knowledge propagation module that mimics human learning by keeping track of strong and weak thoughts for information propagation. Our approach was evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, SVAMP, MultiArith, LastLetterConcatenation, and Gaokao2023 Math. The results demonstrate that RDoLT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a 90.98 percent accuracy on GSM8K with ChatGPT-4, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques by 6.28 percent. Similar improvements were observed on other benchmarks, with accuracy gains ranging from 5.5 percent to 6.75 percent. These findings highlight RDoLT's potential to advance prompt engineering, offering a more effective and generalizable approach to complex reasoning tasks.

> Channel Autoencoders (CAEs) have shown significant potential in optimizing the physical layer of a wireless communication system for a specific channel through joint end-to-end training. However, the practical implementation of CAEs faces several challenges, particularly in realistic and dynamic scenarios. Channels in communication systems are dynamic and change with time. Still, most proposed CAE designs assume stationary scenarios, meaning they are trained and tested for only one channel realization without regard for the dynamic nature of wireless communication systems. Moreover, conventional CAEs are designed based on the assumption of having access to a large number of pilot signals, which act as training samples in the context of CAEs. However, in real-world applications, it is not feasible for a CAE operating in real-time to acquire large amounts of training samples for each new channel realization. Hence, the CAE has to be deployable in few-shot learning scenarios where only limited training samples are available. Furthermore, most proposed conventional CAEs lack fast adaptability to new channel realizations, which becomes more pronounced when dealing with a limited number of pilots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Online Meta Learning channel AE (OML-CAE) framework for few-shot CAE scenarios with dynamic channels. The OML-CAE framework enhances adaptability to varying channel conditions in an online manner, allowing for dynamic adjustments in response to evolving communication scenarios. Moreover, it can adapt to new channel conditions using only a few pilots, drastically increasing pilot efficiency and making the CAE design feasible in realistic scenarios.

> The emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others highlights the importance of evaluating their diverse capabilities, ranging from natural language understanding to code generation. However, their performance on spatial tasks has not been thoroughly assessed. This study addresses this gap by introducing a new multi-task spatial evaluation dataset designed to systematically explore and compare the performance of several advanced models on spatial tasks. The dataset includes twelve distinct task types, such as spatial understanding and simple route planning, each with verified and accurate answers. We evaluated multiple models, including OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4o, ZhipuAI's glm-4, Anthropic's claude-3-sonnet-20240229, and MoonShot's moonshot-v1-8k, using a two-phase testing approach. First, we conducted zero-shot testing. Then, we categorized the dataset by difficulty and performed prompt-tuning tests. Results show that gpt-4o achieved the highest overall accuracy in the first phase, with an average of 71.3%. Although moonshot-v1-8k slightly underperformed overall, it outperformed gpt-4o in place name recognition tasks. The study also highlights the impact of prompt strategies on model performance in specific tasks. For instance, the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy increased gpt-4o's accuracy in simple route planning from 12.4% to 87.5%, while a one-shot strategy improved moonshot-v1-8k's accuracy in mapping tasks from 10.1% to 76.3%.

> As the volume of digital image data increases, the effectiveness of image classification intensifies. This study introduces a robust multi-label classification system designed to assign multiple labels to a single image, addressing the complexity of images that may be associated with multiple categories (ranging from 1 to 19, excluding 12). We propose a multi-modal classifier that merges advanced image recognition algorithms with Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, incorporating a fusion module to integrate these distinct modalities. The purpose of integrating textual data is to enhance the accuracy of label prediction by providing contextual understanding that visual analysis alone cannot fully capture. Our proposed classification model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing with NLP techniques for analyzing textual description (i.e., captions). This approach includes rigorous training and validation phases, with each model component verified and analyzed through ablation experiments. Preliminary results demonstrate the classifier's accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its potential as an automatic image-labeling system.

> Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) adapts a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain in a one-off way. Though widely applied, UDA faces a great challenge whenever the distribution shift between the source and the target is large. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) mitigates this limitation by using intermediate domains to gradually adapt from the source to the target domain. In this work, we first theoretically analyze gradual self-training, a popular GDA algorithm, and provide a significantly improved generalization bound compared with Kumar et al. (2020). Our theoretical analysis leads to an interesting insight: to minimize the generalization error on the target domain, the sequence of intermediate domains should be placed uniformly along the Wasserstein geodesic between the source and target domains. The insight is particularly useful under the situation where intermediate domains are missing or scarce, which is often the case in real-world applications. Based on the insight, we propose $\textbf{G}$enerative Gradual D$\textbf{O}$main $\textbf{A}$daptation with Optimal $\textbf{T}$ransport (GOAT), an algorithmic framework that can generate intermediate domains in a data-dependent way. More concretely, we first generate intermediate domains along the Wasserstein geodesic between two given consecutive domains in a feature space, then apply gradual self-training to adapt the source-trained classifier to the target along the sequence of intermediate domains. Empirically, we demonstrate that our GOAT framework can improve the performance of standard GDA when the given intermediate domains are scarce, significantly broadening the real-world application scenarios of GDA. Our code is available at https://github.com/uiuctml/GOAT.

> Significant advancements have been made in single label incremental learning (SLCIL),yet the more practical and challenging multi label class incremental learning (MLCIL) remains understudied. Recently,visual language models such as CLIP have achieved good results in classification tasks. However,directly using CLIP to solve MLCIL issue can lead to catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this issue, we integrate an improved data replay mechanism and prompt loss to curb knowledge forgetting. Specifically,our model enhances the prompt information to better adapt to multi-label classification tasks and employs confidence-based replay strategy to select representative samples. Moreover, the prompt loss significantly reduces the model's forgetting of previous knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has substantially improved the performance of MLCIL tasks across multiple benchmark datasets,validating its effectiveness.

> DL-based automatic modulation classification (AMC) models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where even minimal input perturbations can cause severe misclassifications. While adversarially training an AMC model based on an adversarial attack significantly increases its robustness against that attack, the AMC model will still be defenseless against other adversarial attacks. The theoretically infinite possibilities for adversarial perturbations mean that an AMC model will inevitably encounter new unseen adversarial attacks if it is ever to be deployed to a real-world communication system. Moreover, the computational limitations and challenges of obtaining new data in real-time will not allow a full training process for the AMC model to adapt to the new attack when it is online. To this end, we propose a meta-learning-based adversarial training framework for AMC models that substantially enhances robustness against unseen adversarial attacks and enables fast adaptation to these attacks using just a few new training samples, if any are available. Our results demonstrate that this training framework provides superior robustness and accuracy with much less online training time than conventional adversarial training of AMC models, making it highly efficient for real-world deployment.

> As financial fraud becomes increasingly complex, effective detection methods are essential. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) introduces certain capabilities that may enhance both accuracy and efficiency in this area. This study examines how different quantum feature map and ansatz configurations affect the performance of three QML-based classifiers-the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), the Sampler Quantum Neural Network (SQNN), and the Estimator Quantum Neural Network (EQNN)-when applied to two non-standardized financial fraud datasets. Different quantum feature map and ansatz configurations are evaluated, revealing distinct performance patterns. The VQC consistently demonstrates strong classification results, achieving an F1 score of 0.88, while the SQNN also delivers promising outcomes. In contrast, the EQNN struggles to produce robust results, emphasizing the challenges presented by non-standardized data. These findings highlight the importance of careful model configuration in QML-based financial fraud detection. By showing how specific feature maps and ansatz choices influence predictive success, this work guides researchers and practitioners in refining QML approaches for complex financial applications.

We show evidence that our method is appropriate for generating molecules with satisfied diversity even when a smaller number of sampling steps is used. A classifier-free guidance method is adapted for conditional generation. It is also worthwhile to point out that after generative training, our model can be fine-tuned on regression and classification tasks with the state-of-the-art performance, which opens the gate of building all-in-one models in a single module style.

> Despite the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), it remains challenging to feed LLMs with long prompts due to the fixed size of LLM inputs. As a remedy, prompt compression becomes a promising solution by removing redundant tokens in the prompt. However, using LLM in the existing works requires additional computation resources and leads to memory overheads. To address it, we propose ICPC (In-context Prompt Compression), a novel and scalable prompt compression method that adaptively reduces the prompt length. The key idea of ICPC is to calculate the probability of each word appearing in the prompt using encoders and calculate information carried by each word through the information function, which effectively reduces the information loss during prompt compression and increases the speed of compression. Empirically, we demonstrate that ICPC can effectively compress long texts of different categories and thus achieve better performance and speed on different types of NLP tasks.

However, accurate microbubble (MB) localization remains a key challenge, as errors in localization can propagate through subsequent stages of the super-resolution process, affecting overall performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of ensemble learning techniques to enhance MB localization by increasing detection sensitivity and reducing false positives. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of ensemble methods on both in vivo and simulated outputs of a Deformable DEtection TRansformer (Deformable DETR) network. As a result of our study, we are able to demonstrate the advantages of these ensemble approaches by showing improved precision and recall in MB detection and offering insights into their application in SR-US.

> Knowledge graph completion (KGC) focuses on identifying missing triples in a knowledge graph (KG) , which is crucial for many downstream applications. Given the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), some LLM-based methods are proposed for KGC task. However, most of them focus on prompt engineering while overlooking the fact that finer-grained subgraph information can aid LLMs in generating more accurate answers. In this paper, we propose a novel completion framework called \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{S}ubgraph-based KGC (GS-KGC), which utilizes subgraph information as contextual reasoning and employs a QA approach to achieve the KGC task. This framework primarily includes a subgraph partitioning algorithm designed to generate negatives and neighbors. Specifically, negatives can encourage LLMs to generate a broader range of answers, while neighbors provide additional contextual insights for LLM reasoning. Furthermore, we found that GS-KGC can discover potential triples within the KGs and new facts beyond the KGs. Experiments conducted on four common KGC datasets highlight the advantages of the proposed GS-KGC, e.g., it shows a 5.6\% increase in Hits@3 compared to the LLM-based model CP-KGC on the FB15k-237N, and a 9.3\% increase over the LLM-based model TECHS on the ICEWS14.

The pipeline includes fine-tuned YOLOv5xu for speech bubble detection, Tesseract for OCR and fine-tuned MarianMT for machine translation. By automating these steps, we aim to make Manhwa more accessible to a global audience while saving time and effort compared to manual translation methods. While most Manhwa translation efforts focus on Japanese-to-English, we focus on Indonesian-to-English translation to address the challenges of working with low-resource languages. Our model shows good results at each step and was able to translate from Indonesian to English efficiently.

We applied the model to two datasets, demonstrating predictive performance that is competitive with, and even superior to, state-of-the-art methods. One of the datasets considered is adapted from the Math Genealogy Project, which has not previously been utilized for this purpose. Consequently, we evaluated several classification algorithms on this dataset to compare the performance of our model and provide benchmarks for this new resource.

> Diffusion models have been widely deployed in various image generation tasks, demonstrating an extraordinary connection between image and text modalities. Although prior studies have explored the vulnerability of diffusion models from the perspectives of text and image modalities separately, the current research landscape has not yet thoroughly investigated the vulnerabilities that arise from the integration of multiple modalities, specifically through the joint analysis of textual and visual features. In this paper, we are the first to visualize both text and image feature space embedded by diffusion models and observe a significant difference. The prompts are embedded chaotically in the text feature space, while in the image feature space they are clustered according to their subjects. These fascinating findings may underscore a potential misalignment in robustness between the two modalities that exists within diffusion models. Based on this observation, we propose MMP-Attack, which leverages multi-modal priors (MMP) to manipulate the generation results of diffusion models by appending a specific suffix to the original prompt. Specifically, our goal is to induce diffusion models to generate a specific object while simultaneously eliminating the original object. Our MMP-Attack shows a notable advantage over existing studies with superior manipulation capability and efficiency. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ydc123/MMP-Attack}.

> Online continual learning, aimed at developing a neural network that continuously learns new data from a single pass over an online data stream, generally suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Existing replay-based methods alleviate forgetting by replaying partial old data in a proxy-based or contrastive-based replay manner, each with its own shortcomings. Our previous work proposes a novel replay-based method called proxy-based contrastive replay (PCR), which handles the shortcomings by achieving complementary advantages of both replay manners. In this work, we further conduct gradient and limitation analysis of PCR. The analysis results show that PCR still can be further improved in feature extraction, generalization, and anti-forgetting capabilities of the model. Hence, we develop a more advanced method named holistic proxy-based contrastive replay (HPCR). HPCR consists of three components, each tackling one of the limitations of PCR. The contrastive component conditionally incorporates anchor-to-sample pairs to PCR, improving the feature extraction ability. The second is a temperature component that decouples the temperature coefficient into two parts based on their gradient impacts and sets different values for them to enhance the generalization ability. The third is a distillation component that constrains the learning process with additional loss terms to improve the anti-forgetting ability. Experiments on four datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of HPCR over various state-of-the-art methods.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning representations of graph-structured data, demonstrating remarkable performance across various tasks. Recognising their importance, there has been extensive research focused on explaining GNN predictions, aiming to enhance their interpretability and trustworthiness. However, GNNs and their explainers face a notable challenge: graphs are primarily designed to model pair-wise relationships between nodes, which can make it tough to capture higher-order, multi-node interactions. This characteristic can pose difficulties for existing explainers in fully representing multi-node relationships. To address this gap, we present Framework For Higher-Order Representations In Graph Explanations (FORGE), a framework that enables graph explainers to capture such interactions by incorporating higher-order structures, resulting in more accurate and faithful explanations. Extensive evaluation shows that on average real-world datasets from the GraphXAI benchmark and synthetic datasets across various graph explainers, FORGE improves average explanation accuracy by 1.9x and 2.25x, respectively. We perform ablation studies to confirm the importance of higher-order relations in improving explanations, while our scalability analysis demonstrates FORGE's efficacy on large graphs.

Our ensemble learning approach significantly reduces the computational complexity inherent in GPR inference and lends itself to general online learning tasks. We conduct an empirical analysis on a large cross-section of US stocks from 1962 to 2016. We find that our method dominates existing machine learning models statistically and economically in terms of out-of-sample $R$-squared and Sharpe ratio of prediction-sorted portfolios. Exploiting the Bayesian nature of GPR, we introduce the mean-variance optimal portfolio with respect to the prediction uncertainty distribution of the expected stock returns. It appeals to an uncertainty averse investor and significantly dominates the equal- and value-weighted prediction-sorted portfolios, which outperform the S&P 500.

> Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss, executive dysfunction, and personality changes. Early diagnosis is challenging due to subtle symptoms and varied presentations, often leading to misdiagnosis with traditional unimodal diagnostic methods due to their limited scope. This study introduces an advanced multimodal classification model that integrates clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and EEG data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The model incorporates a feature tagger with a tabular data coding architecture and utilizes the TimesBlock module to capture intricate temporal patterns in Electroencephalograms (EEG) data. By employing Cross-modal Attention Aggregation module, the model effectively fuses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial information with EEG temporal data, significantly improving the distinction between AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Normal Cognition. Simultaneously, we have constructed the first AD classification dataset that includes three modalities: EEG, MRI, and tabular data. Our innovative approach aims to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, potentially slowing the progression of AD.

> Large language models have emergent capabilities that come unexpectedly at scale, but we need a theoretical framework to explain why and how they emerge. We prove that language models are actually non-ergodic systems while providing a mathematical framework based on Stuart Kauffman's theory of the adjacent possible (TAP) to explain capability emergence. Our resource-constrained TAP equation demonstrates how architectural, training, and contextual constraints interact to shape model capabilities through phase transitions in semantic space. We prove through experiments with three different language models that capacities emerge through discrete transitions guided by constraint interactions and path-dependent exploration. This framework provides a theoretical basis for understanding emergence in language models and guides the development of architectures that can guide capability emergence.

> Current methods for searching brain MR images rely on text-based approaches, highlighting a significant need for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Directly applying 3D brain MR images to machine learning models offers the benefit of effectively learning the brain's structure; however, building the generalized model necessitates a large amount of training data. While models that consider depth direction and utilize continuous 2D slices have demonstrated success in segmentation and classification tasks involving 3D data, concerns remain. Specifically, using general 2D slices may lead to the oversight of pathological features and discontinuities in depth direction information. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no attempts to develop a practical CBIR system that preserves the entire brain's structural information. In this study, we propose an interpretable CBIR method for brain MR images, named iCBIR-Sli (Interpretable CBIR with 2D Slice Embedding), which, for the first time globally, utilizes a series of 2D slices. iCBIR-Sli addresses the challenges associated with using 2D slices by effectively aggregating slice information, thereby achieving low-dimensional representations with high completeness, usability, robustness, and interoperability, which are qualities essential for effective CBIR. In retrieval evaluation experiments utilizing five publicly available brain MR datasets (ADNI2/3, OASIS3/4, AIBL) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal, iCBIR-Sli demonstrated top-1 retrieval performance (macro F1 = 0.859), comparable to existing deep learning models explicitly designed for classification, without the need for an external classifier. Additionally, the method provided high interpretability by clearly identifying the brain regions indicative of the searched-for disease.

> Multimodal large language models have become a popular topic in deep visual understanding due to many promising real-world applications. However, hour-long video understanding, spanning over one hour and containing tens of thousands of visual frames, remains under-explored because of 1) challenging long-term video analyses, 2) inefficient large-model approaches, and 3) lack of large-scale benchmark datasets.

HLV-1K comprises 1009 hour-long videos with 14,847 high-quality question answering (QA) and multi-choice question asnwering (MCQA) pairs with time-aware query and diverse annotations, covering frame-level, within-event-level, cross-event-level, and long-term reasoning tasks. We evaluate our benchmark using existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its value for testing deep long video understanding capabilities at different levels and for various tasks.

> Data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of machine learning tasks by addressing data scarcity and improving generalization. However, generating time series data presents unique challenges. A model must not only learn a probability distribution that reflects the real data distribution but also capture the conditional distribution at each time step to preserve the inherent temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce AVATAR, a framework that combines Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE) with Autoregressive Learning to achieve both objectives. Specifically, our technique integrates the autoencoder with a supervisor and introduces a novel supervised loss to assist the decoder in learning the temporal dynamics of time series data. Additionally, we propose another innovative loss function, termed distribution loss, to guide the encoder in more efficiently aligning the aggregated posterior of the autoencoder's latent representation with a prior Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, our framework employs a joint training mechanism to simultaneously train all networks using a combined loss, thereby fulfilling the dual objectives of time series generation. We evaluate our technique across a variety of time series datasets with diverse characteristics. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both the quality and practical utility of the generated data, as assessed by various qualitative and quantitative metrics.

> Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Existing works have shown the insufficiency of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) straightforwardly applied on the features of DNNs in detecting OoD data from In-Distribution (InD) data. The failure of PCA suggests that the network features residing in OoD and InD are not well separated by simply proceeding in a linear subspace, which instead can be resolved through proper non-linear mappings. In this work, we leverage the framework of Kernel PCA (KPCA) for OoD detection, and seek suitable non-linear kernels that advocate the separability between InD and OoD data in the subspace spanned by the principal components. Besides, explicit feature mappings induced from the devoted task-specific kernels are adopted so that the KPCA reconstruction error for new test samples can be efficiently obtained with large-scale data. Extensive theoretical and empirical results on multiple OoD data sets and network structures verify the superiority of our KPCA detector in efficiency and efficacy with state-of-the-art detection performance.

> Personalized federated learning (PFL) studies effective model personalization to address the data heterogeneity issue among clients in traditional federated learning (FL). Existing PFL approaches mainly generate personalized models by relying solely on the clients' latest updated models while ignoring their previous updates, which may result in suboptimal personalized model learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed pFedSeq, designed for personalizing adapters to fine-tune a foundation model in FL. In pFedSeq, the server maintains and trains a sequential learner, which processes a sequence of past adapter updates from clients and generates calibrations for personalized adapters. To effectively capture the cross-client and cross-step relations hidden in previous updates and generate high-performing personalized adapters, pFedSeq adopts the powerful selective state space model (SSM) as the architecture of sequential learner. Through extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of pFedSeq over state-of-the-art PFL methods.

> Automatic Traffic Sign Recognition is paramount in modern transportation systems, motivating several research endeavors to focus on performance improvement by utilizing large-scale datasets. As the appearance of traffic signs varies across countries, curating large-scale datasets is often impractical; and requires efficient models that can produce satisfactory performance using limited data. In this connection, we present 'FUSED-Net', built-upon Faster RCNN for traffic sign detection, enhanced by Unfrozen Parameters, Pseudo-Support Sets, Embedding Normalization, and Domain Adaptation while reducing data requirement. Unlike traditional approaches, we keep all parameters unfrozen during training, enabling FUSED-Net to learn from limited samples. The generation of a Pseudo-Support Set through data augmentation further enhances performance by compensating for the scarcity of target domain data. Additionally, Embedding Normalization is incorporated to reduce intra-class variance, standardizing feature representation. Domain Adaptation, achieved by pre-training on a diverse traffic sign dataset distinct from the target domain, improves model generalization. Evaluating FUSED-Net on the BDTSD dataset, we achieved 2.4x, 2.2x, 1.5x, and 1.3x improvements of mAP in 1-shot, 3-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot scenarios, respectively compared to the state-of-the-art Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) models. Additionally, we outperform state-of-the-art works on the cross-domain FSOD benchmark under several scenarios.

> Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems significantly surpass traditional turn-based dialogue systems, as they allow simultaneous bidirectional communication, closely mirroring human-human interactions. However, achieving low latency and natural interactions in full-duplex dialogue systems remains a significant challenge, especially considering human conversation dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. In this paper, we introduce a novel End-to-End GPT-based model OmniFlatten for full-duplex conversation, capable of effectively modeling the complex behaviors inherent to natural conversations with low latency. To achieve full-duplex conversation capabilities, we propose a multi-stage post-training scheme that progressively adapts a text large language model (LLM) backbone into a speech-text dialogue LLM, capable of generating text and speech in real time, without modifying the architecture of the backbone LLM. The training process comprises three stages: modality alignment, half-duplex dialogue learning, and full-duplex dialogue learning. In all training stages, we standardize the data using a flattening operation, which enables unifying the training methods and the GPT backbone across different modalities and tasks. Our approach offers a simple modeling technique and a promising research direction for developing efficient and natural end-to-end full-duplex spoken dialogue systems. Audio samples of dialogues generated by OmniFlatten can be found at this web site (https://omniflatten.github.io/).

> Weakly-supervised medical image segmentation is gaining traction as it requires only rough annotations rather than accurate pixel-to-pixel labels, thereby reducing the workload for specialists. Although some progress has been made, there is still a considerable performance gap between the label-efficient methods and fully-supervised one, which can be attributed to the uncertainty nature of these weak labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel weak annotation method coupled with its learning framework EAUWSeg to eliminate the annotation uncertainty. Specifically, we first propose the Bounded Polygon Annotation (BPAnno) by simply labeling two polygons for a lesion. Then, the tailored learning mechanism that explicitly treat bounded polygons as two separated annotations is proposed to learn invariant feature by providing adversarial supervision signal for model training. Subsequently, a confidence-auxiliary consistency learner incorporates with a classification-guided confidence generator is designed to provide reliable supervision signal for pixels in uncertain region by leveraging the feature presentation consistency across pixels within the same category as well as class-specific information encapsulated in bounded polygons annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that EAUWSeg outperforms existing weakly-supervised segmentation methods. Furthermore, compared to fully-supervised counterparts, the proposed method not only delivers superior performance but also costs much less annotation workload. This underscores the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

> Algorithmic fairness of machine learning (ML) models has raised significant concern in the recent years. Many testing, verification, and bias mitigation techniques have been proposed to identify and reduce fairness issues in ML models. The existing methods are model-centric and designed to detect fairness issues under static settings. However, many ML-enabled systems operate in a dynamic environment where the predictive decisions made by the system impact the environment, which in turn affects future decision-making. Such a self-reinforcing feedback loop can cause fairness violations in the long term, even if the immediate outcomes are fair. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based framework called FairSense to detect and analyze long-term unfairness in ML-enabled systems. Given a fairness requirement, FairSense performs Monte-Carlo simulation to enumerate evolution traces for each system configuration. Then, FairSense performs sensitivity analysis on the space of possible configurations to understand the impact of design options and environmental factors on the long-term fairness of the system. We demonstrate FairSense's potential utility through three real-world case studies: Loan lending, opioids risk scoring, and predictive policing.

> Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) has progressed significantly toward accurately learning the underlying rewards in both discrete and continuous domains from behavior data. The next advance is to learn {\em intrinsic} preferences in ways that produce useful behavior in settings or tasks which are different but aligned with the observed ones. In the context of robotic applications, this helps integrate robots into processing lines involving new tasks (with shared intrinsic preferences) without programming from scratch. We introduce a method to inversely learn an abstract reward function from behavior trajectories in two or more differing instances of a domain. The abstract reward function is then used to learn task behavior in another separate instance of the domain. This step offers evidence of its transferability and validates its correctness. We evaluate the method on trajectories in tasks from multiple domains in OpenAI's Gym testbed and AssistiveGym and show that the learned abstract reward functions can successfully learn task behaviors in instances of the respective domains, which have not been seen previously.

> With the integration of an additional modality, large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit greater vulnerability to safety risks (e.g., jailbreaking) compared to their language-only predecessors. Although recent studies have devoted considerable effort to the post-hoc alignment of LVLMs, the inner safety mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we discover that internal activations of LVLMs during the first token generation can effectively identify malicious prompts across different attacks. This inherent safety perception is governed by sparse attention heads, which we term ``safety heads." Further analysis reveals that these heads act as specialized shields against malicious prompts; ablating them leads to higher attack success rates, while the model's utility remains unaffected. By locating these safety heads and concatenating their activations, we construct a straightforward but powerful malicious prompt detector that integrates seamlessly into the generation process with minimal extra inference overhead. Despite its simple structure of a logistic regression model, the detector surprisingly exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. Experiments across various prompt-based attacks confirm the effectiveness of leveraging safety heads to protect LVLMs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Ziwei-Zheng/SAHs}.

> Backpropagation provides a generalized configuration for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Like, SGD and Adam are commonly used for weight updates in continual learning and continual pre-training. In practice, permission to access gradient information is not always granted (the gradient ban), such as black-box APIs, hardware limitations, and non-differentiable systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first benchmark ZeroFlow to evaluate gradient-free optimization algorithms for overcoming forgetting. This benchmark examines a suite of forward pass methods across multiple methods, forgetting scenarios, and datasets. We find that forward passes alone are enough to overcome forgetting. Our findings reveal new optimization principles that highlight the potential of forward-pass in mitigating forgetting, managing task conflicts, and reducing memory demands, alongside novel enhancements that further mitigate forgetting with just one forward pass. This work provides essential insights and tools for advancing forward pass methods to overcome forgetting.

> Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for training machine learning models on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, privacy risks, particularly Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a specific data point belongs to a target client's training set, remain a significant concern. Existing methods for implementing MIAs in FL primarily analyze updates from the target client, focusing on metrics such as loss, gradient norm, and gradient difference. However, these methods fail to leverage updates from non-target clients, potentially underutilizing available information. In this paper, we first formulate a one-tailed likelihood-ratio hypothesis test based on the likelihood of updates from non-target clients. Building upon this formulation, we introduce a three-step Membership Inference Attack (MIA) method, called FedMIA, which follows the "all for one"--leveraging updates from all clients across multiple communication rounds to enhance MIA effectiveness. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedMIA outperforms existing MIAs in both classification and generative tasks. Additionally, it can be integrated as an extension to existing methods and is robust against various defense strategies, Non-IID data, and different federated structures. Our code is available in https://github.com/Liar-Mask/FedMIA.

> Generative models based on flow matching have attracted significant attention for their simplicity and superior performance in high-resolution image synthesis. By leveraging the instantaneous change-of-variables formula, one can directly compute image likelihoods from a learned flow, making them enticing candidates as priors for downstream tasks such as inverse problems. In particular, a natural approach would be to incorporate such image probabilities in a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation problem. A major obstacle, however, lies in the slow computation of the log-likelihood, as it requires backpropagating through an ODE solver, which can be prohibitively slow for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an iterative algorithm to approximate the MAP estimator efficiently to solve a variety of linear inverse problems. Our algorithm is mathematically justified by the observation that the MAP objective can be approximated by a sum of $N$ ``local MAP'' objectives, where $N$ is the number of function evaluations. By leveraging Tweedie's formula, we show that we can perform gradient steps to sequentially optimize these objectives. We validate our approach for various linear inverse problems, such as super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and compressed sensing, and demonstrate that we can outperform other methods based on flow matching.

> Deep learning has significantly advanced molecular modeling and design, enabling efficient understanding and discovery of novel molecules. In particular, large language models (LLMs) introduce a fresh research paradigm to tackle scientific problems from a natural language processing (NLP) perspective. LLMs significantly enhance our understanding and generation of molecules, often surpassing existing methods with their capabilities to decode and synthesize complex molecular patterns. However, two key issues remain: how to quantify the match between model and data modalities and how to identify the knowledge-learning preferences of models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal benchmark, named ChEBI-20-MM, and perform 1263 experiments to assess the model's compatibility with data modalities and knowledge acquisition. Through the modal transition probability matrix, we provide insights into the most suitable modalities for tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a statistically interpretable approach to discover context-specific knowledge mapping by localized feature filtering. Our analysis offers an exploration of the learning mechanism and paves the way for advancing LLMs in molecular science.

> Recently, Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning have demonstrated remarkable potential in handling neural machine translation. However, existing evidence shows that LLMs are prompt-sensitive and it is sub-optimal to apply the fixed prompt to any input for downstream machine translation tasks. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive few-shot prompting (AFSP) framework to automatically select suitable translation demonstrations for various source input sentences to further elicit the translation capability of an LLM for better machine translation. First, we build a translation demonstration retrieval module based on LLM's embedding to retrieve top-k semantic-similar translation demonstrations from aligned parallel translation corpus. Rather than using other embedding models for semantic demonstration retrieval, we build a hybrid demonstration retrieval module based on the embedding layer of the deployed LLM to build better input representation for retrieving more semantic-related translation demonstrations. Then, to ensure better semantic consistency between source inputs and target outputs, we force the deployed LLM itself to generate multiple output candidates in the target language with the help of translation demonstrations and rerank these candidates. Besides, to better evaluate the effectiveness of our AFSP framework on the latest language and extend the research boundary of neural machine translation, we construct a high-quality diplomatic Chinese-English parallel dataset that consists of 5,528 parallel Chinese-English sentences. Finally, extensive experiments on the proposed diplomatic Chinese-English parallel dataset and the United Nations Parallel Corpus (Chinese-English part) show the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed AFSP.

> We introduce a class of trainable nonlinear operators based on semirings that are suitable for use in neural networks. These operators generalize the traditional alternation of linear operators with activation functions in neural networks. Semirings are algebraic structures that describe a generalised notation of linearity, greatly expanding the range of trainable operators that can be included in neural networks. In fact, max- or min-pooling operations are convolutions in the tropical semiring with a fixed kernel.   We perform experiments where we replace the activation functions for trainable semiring-based operators to show that these are viable operations to include in fully connected as well as convolutional neural networks (ConvNeXt). We discuss some of the challenges of replacing traditional activation functions with trainable semiring activations and the trade-offs of doing so.

Categorized by operator type (military, commercial, and private), the analysis identified key themes such as pilot error, mechanical failure, weather conditions, and training deficiencies. The study highlights the unique strengths of each method: LDA ability to uncover overlapping themes, NMF production of distinct and interpretable topics, and PLSA nuanced probabilistic insights despite interpretative complexity. Statistical analysis revealed that PLSA achieved a coherence score of 0.32 and a perplexity value of -4.6, NMF scored 0.34 and 37.1, while LDA achieved the highest coherence of 0.36 but recorded the highest perplexity at 38.2. These findings demonstrate the value of topic modelling in extracting actionable insights from unstructured aviation safety narratives, aiding in the identification of risk factors and areas for improvement across sectors. Future directions include integrating additional contextual variables, leveraging neural topic models, and enhancing aviation safety protocols.

> With the continuous improvement in the computational capabilities of edge devices such as intelligent sensors in the Industrial Internet of Things, these sensors are no longer limited to mere data collection but are increasingly capable of performing complex computational tasks. This advancement provides both the motivation and the foundation for adopting distributed learning approaches. This study focuses on an industrial assembly line scenario where multiple sensors, distributed across various locations, sequentially collect real-time data characterized by distinct feature spaces. To leverage the computational potential of these sensors while addressing the challenges of communication overhead and privacy concerns inherent in centralized learning, we propose the Denoising and Adaptive Online Vertical Federated Learning (DAO-VFL) algorithm. Tailored to the industrial assembly line scenario, DAO-VFL effectively manages continuous data streams and adapts to shifting learning objectives. Furthermore, it can address critical challenges prevalent in industrial environment, such as communication noise and heterogeneity of sensor capabilities. To support the proposed algorithm, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, highlighting the effects of noise reduction and adaptive local iteration decisions on the regret bound. Experimental results on two real-world datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of DAO-VFL compared to benchmarks algorithms.

> Given the paramount importance of safety in the aviation industry, even minor operational anomalies can have significant consequences. Comprehensive documentation of incidents and accidents serves to identify root causes and propose safety measures. However, the unstructured nature of incident event narratives poses a challenge for computer systems to interpret. Our study aimed to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning models to analyze these narratives and classify the aircraft damage level incurred during safety occurrences. Through the implementation of LSTM, BLSTM, GRU, and sRNN deep learning models, our research yielded promising results, with all models showcasing competitive performance, achieving an accuracy of over 88% significantly surpassing the 25% random guess threshold for a four-class classification problem. Notably, the sRNN model emerged as the top performer in terms of recall and accuracy, boasting a remarkable 89%. These findings underscore the potential of NLP and deep learning models in extracting actionable insights from unstructured text narratives, particularly in evaluating the extent of aircraft damage within the realm of aviation safety occurrences.

> Tensors, which give a faithful and effective representation to deliver the intrinsic structure of multi-dimensional data, play a crucial role in an increasing number of signal processing and machine learning problems. However, tensor data are often accompanied by arbitrary signal corruptions, including missing entries and sparse noise. A fundamental challenge is to reliably extract the meaningful information from corrupted tensor data in a statistically and computationally efficient manner. This paper develops a scaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly estimate the tensor factors with tailored spectral initializations under the tensor-tensor product (t-product) and tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) framework. In theory, ScaledGD achieves linear convergence at a constant rate that is independent of the condition number of the ground truth low-rank tensor for two canonical problems -- tensor robust principal component analysis and tensor completion -- as long as the level of corruptions is not too large and the sample size is sufficiently large, while maintaining the low per-iteration cost of gradient descent. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that provably has such properties for low-rank tensor estimation with the t-SVD decomposition. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of ScaledGD in accelerating the convergence rate of ill-conditioned low-rank tensor estimation in these two applications.

> Recent years have witnessed the success of foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) in various music informatics understanding tasks, including music tagging, instrument classification, key detection, and more. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised music representation learning model for music understanding. Distinguished from previous studies adopting random projection or existing neural codec, the proposed model, named MuQ, is trained to predict tokens generated by Mel Residual Vector Quantization (Mel-RVQ). Our Mel-RVQ utilizes residual linear projection structure for Mel spectrum quantization to enhance the stability and efficiency of target extraction and lead to better performance. Experiments in a large variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MuQ outperforms previous self-supervised music representation models with only 0.9K hours of open-source pre-training data. Scaling up the data to over 160K hours and adopting iterative training consistently improve the model performance. To further validate the strength of our model, we present MuQ-MuLan, a joint music-text embedding model based on contrastive learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot music tagging task on the MagnaTagATune dataset. Code and checkpoints are open source in https://github.com/tencent-ailab/MuQ.

In response to issues such as the lag in climate change knowledge updates within large language models, the lack of specialization and accuracy in traditional augmented generation architectures for complex problems, and the high cost and time consumption of sustainability report analysis, this paper proposes CarbonChat: Large Language Model-based corporate carbon emission analysis and climate knowledge Q&A system, aimed at achieving precise carbon emission analysis and policy understanding.First, a diversified index module construction method is proposed to handle the segmentation of rule-based and long-text documents, as well as the extraction of structured data, thereby optimizing the parsing of key information.Second, an enhanced self-prompt retrieval-augmented generation architecture is designed, integrating intent recognition, structured reasoning chains, hybrid retrieval, and Text2SQL, improving the efficiency of semantic understanding and query conversion.Next, based on the greenhouse gas accounting framework, 14 dimensions are established for carbon emission analysis, enabling report summarization, relevance evaluation, and customized responses.Finally, through a multi-layer chunking mechanism, timestamps, and hallucination detection features, the accuracy and verifiability of the analysis results are ensured, reducing hallucination rates and enhancing the precision of the responses.

> With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), concerns regarding their security have increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, designing effective multimodal jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given the distinct protective measures implemented across various modalities in commercial models. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting in limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy and heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution strategy is used to segment harmful instructions across multiple modalities to effectively circumvent MLLMs' security protection. The heuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the understanding-enhancing prompt, which helps the MLLM reconstruct the malicious prompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative outputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively uncovers vulnerabilities in MLLMs, achieving an average attack success rate of 90% across seven popular open-source MLLMs and an average attack success rate of around 68% in three popular closed-source MLLMs. Our code will coming soon.

> Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have proved their ability to perform complex tasks like humans. However, there is still a large gap between open-sourced LLMs and commercial models like the GPT series. In this paper, we focus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via instruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus exhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to generalize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting errors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We analyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several manual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They struggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but just memorize existing observation-action relations. Inspired by the insight, we propose a novel AgentRefine framework for agent-tuning. The core idea is to enable the model to learn to correct its mistakes via observation in the trajectory. Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass a diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its error action according to the environment feedback. AgentRefine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent-tuning work in terms of generalization ability on diverse agent tasks. It also has better robustness facing perturbation and can generate diversified thought in inference. Our findings establish the correlation between agent generalization and self-refinement and provide a new paradigm for future research.

> Learning predictive world models is crucial for enhancing the planning capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recently, MuZero-style algorithms, leveraging the value equivalence principle and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have achieved superhuman performance in various domains. However, these methods struggle to scale in heterogeneous scenarios with diverse dependencies and task variability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniZero, a novel approach that employs a modular transformer-based world model to effectively learn a shared latent space. By concurrently predicting latent dynamics and decision-oriented quantities conditioned on the learned latent history, UniZero enables joint optimization of the long-horizon world model and policy, facilitating broader and more efficient planning in the latent space. We show that UniZero significantly outperforms existing baselines in benchmarks that require long-term memory. Additionally, UniZero demonstrates superior scalability in multitask learning experiments conducted on Atari benchmarks. In standard single-task RL settings, such as Atari and DMControl, UniZero matches or even surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, extensive ablation studies and visual analyses validate the effectiveness and scalability of UniZero's design choices.

> The advent of blockchain technology has facilitated the widespread adoption of smart contracts in the financial sector. However, current fraud detection methodologies exhibit limitations in capturing both global structural patterns within transaction networks and local semantic relationships embedded in transaction data. Most existing models focus on either structural information or semantic features individually, leading to suboptimal performance in detecting complex fraud patterns.In this paper, we propose a dynamic feature fusion model that combines graph-based representation learning and semantic feature extraction for blockchain fraud detection. Specifically, we construct global graph representations to model account relationships and extract local contextual features from transaction data. A dynamic multimodal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate these features, enabling the model to capture both structural and semantic fraud patterns effectively. We further develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline, including graph construction, temporal feature enhancement, and text preprocessing. Experimental results on large-scale real-world blockchain datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing benchmarks across accuracy, F1 score, and recall metrics. This work highlights the importance of integrating structural relationships and semantic similarities for robust fraud detection and offers a scalable solution for securing blockchain systems.

> Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a fundamental psychological capability that allows humans to understand and interpret the mental states of others. Humans infer others' thoughts by integrating causal cues and indirect clues from broad contextual information, often derived from past interactions. In other words, human ToM heavily relies on the understanding about the backgrounds and life stories of others. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in existing benchmarks for evaluating machines' ToM capabilities, due to their usage of short narratives without global backgrounds. In this paper, we verify the importance of understanding long personal backgrounds in ToM and assess the performance of LLMs in such realistic evaluation scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce a novel benchmark, CharToM-QA, comprising 1,035 ToM questions based on characters from classic novels. Our human study reveals a significant disparity in performance: the same group of educated participants performs dramatically better when they have read the novels compared to when they have not. In parallel, our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including the very recent o1 model, show that LLMs still perform notably worse than humans, despite that they have seen these stories during pre-training. This highlights the limitations of current LLMs in capturing the nuanced contextual information required for ToM reasoning.

> To improve the generalization of the autonomous driving (AD) perception model, vehicles need to update the model over time based on the continuously collected data. As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.

> The Certainty Equivalent heuristic (CE) is a widely-used algorithm for various dynamic resource allocation problems in OR and OM. Despite its popularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings satisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the non-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of such conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic innovation beyond CE.   In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the general framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves uniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under only mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any fluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief, CE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem instances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the distinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete settings. Our explicit regret bound interpolates between the mild $(\log T)^2$ regime and the worst-case $\sqrt{T}$ regime with a parameter $\beta$ quantifying the minimal rate of probability accumulation of the conditional reward distributions, generalizing prior findings in the multisecretary setting.   To achieve these results, we develop novel algorithmic analytical techniques. Drawing tools from the empirical processes theory, we establish strong concentration analysis of the solutions to random linear programs, leading to improved regret analysis under significantly relaxed assumptions. These techniques may find potential applications in broader online decision-making contexts.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their increasing size poses significant challenges in memory usage and computational costs. Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with fine-grained block-wise quantization emerging as a promising hardware-supported solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. To address this, we propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures hardware efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 11.83% (7.56%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit usage per data, while being only 5.46% (2.65%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.

> Humanoid robots must master numerous tasks with sparse rewards, posing a challenge for reinforcement learning (RL). We propose a method combining RL and automated planning to address this. Our approach uses short goal-conditioned policies (GCPs) organized hierarchically, with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning using high-level actions (HLAs). Instead of primitive actions, the planning process generates HLAs. A single plan-tree, maintained during the agent's lifetime, holds knowledge about goal achievement. This hierarchy enhances sample efficiency and speeds up reasoning by reusing HLAs and anticipating future actions. Our Hierarchical Goal-Conditioned Policy Planning (HGCPP) framework uniquely integrates GCPs, MCTS, and hierarchical RL, potentially improving exploration and planning in complex tasks.

> The indoor environment significantly impacts human health and well-being; enhancing health and reducing energy consumption in these settings is a central research focus. With the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), recommendation systems and reinforcement learning (RL) have emerged as promising approaches to induce behavioral changes to improve the indoor environment and energy efficiency of buildings. This study aims to employ text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to thoroughly examine the connections among these approaches in the context of human-building interaction and occupant context-aware support. The study analyzed 27,595 articles from the ScienceDirect database, revealing extensive use of recommendation systems and RL for space optimization, location recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Furthermore, this review underscores the vast potential for expanding recommender systems and RL applications in buildings and indoor environments. Fields ripe for innovation include predictive maintenance, building-related product recommendation, and optimization of environments tailored for specific needs, such as sleep and productivity enhancements based on user feedback.

> Automatic X-ray prohibited item detection is vital for public safety. Existing deep learning-based methods all assume that the annotations of training X-ray images are correct. However, obtaining correct annotations is extremely hard if not impossible for large-scale X-ray images, where item overlapping is ubiquitous.As a result, X-ray images are easily contaminated with noisy annotations, leading to performance deterioration of existing methods.In this paper, we address the challenging problem of training a robust prohibited item detector under noisy annotations (including both category noise and bounding box noise) from a novel perspective of data augmentation, and propose an effective label-aware mixed patch paste augmentation method (Mix-Paste). Specifically, for each item patch, we mix several item patches with the same category label from different images and replace the original patch in the image with the mixed patch. In this way, the probability of containing the correct prohibited item within the generated image is increased. Meanwhile, the mixing process mimics item overlapping, enabling the model to learn the characteristics of X-ray images. Moreover, we design an item-based large-loss suppression (LLS) strategy to suppress the large losses corresponding to potentially positive predictions of additional items due to the mixing operation. We show the superiority of our method on X-ray datasets under noisy annotations. In addition, we evaluate our method on the noisy MS-COCO dataset to showcase its generalization ability. These results clearly indicate the great potential of data augmentation to handle noise annotations. The source code is released at https://github.com/wscds/Mix-Paste.

> Electricity generated from renewable energy sources has been established as an efficient remedy for both energy shortages and the environmental pollution stemming from conventional energy production methods. Solar and wind power are two of the most dominant renewable energy sources. The accurate forecasting of the energy generation of those sources facilitates their integration into electric grids, by minimizing the negative impact of uncertainty regarding their management and operation. This paper proposes a novel methodology for deterministic wind and solar energy generation forecasting for multiple generation sites, utilizing multi-location weather forecasts. The method employs a U-shaped Temporal Convolutional Auto-Encoder (UTCAE) architecture for temporal processing of weather-related and energy-related time-series across each site. The Multi-sized Kernels convolutional Spatio-Temporal Attention (MKST-Attention), inspired by the multi-head scaled-dot product attention mechanism, is also proposed aiming to efficiently transfer temporal patterns from weather data to energy data, without a priori knowledge of the locations of the power stations and the locations of provided weather data. The conducted experimental evaluation on a day-ahead solar and wind energy forecasting scenario on five datasets demonstrated that the proposed method achieves top results, outperforming all competitive time-series forecasting state-of-the-art methods.

> Language is a deep-rooted means of perpetration of stereotypes and discrimination. Large Language Models (LLMs), now a pervasive technology in our everyday lives, can cause extensive harm when prone to generating toxic responses. The standard way to address this issue is to align the LLM, which, however, dampens the issue without constituting a definitive solution. Therefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for detecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present EvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity, providing a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards toxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an iterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the System Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward higher toxicity. The toxicity level is assessed by an automated oracle based on an existing toxicity classifier. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluation using four state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects having increasing complexity (7-13 billion parameters). Our quantitative evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of EvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated datasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment engages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the perceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions. Results indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level, is significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to 1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks). Furthermore, EvoTox yields a limited cost overhead (from 22% to 35% on average).

> Writing persuasive arguments is a challenging task for both humans and machines. It entails incorporating high-level beliefs from various perspectives on the topic, along with deliberate reasoning and planning to construct a coherent narrative. Current language models often generate surface tokens autoregressively, lacking explicit integration of these underlying controls, resulting in limited output diversity and coherence. In this work, we propose a persona-based multi-agent framework for argument writing. Inspired by the human debate, we first assign each agent a persona representing its high-level beliefs from a unique perspective, and then design an agent interaction process so that the agents can collaboratively debate and discuss the idea to form an overall plan for argument writing. Such debate process enables fluid and nonlinear development of ideas. We evaluate our framework on argumentative essay writing. The results show that our framework can generate more diverse and persuasive arguments through both automatic and human evaluations.

> Enhancing node-level Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs remains a crucial area of research. In this paper, we develop a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to theoretically dissect the performance of two prominent invariant learning methods -- Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance-Risk Extrapolation (VREx) -- in node-level OOD settings. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: due to the lack of class-conditional invariance constraints, these methods may struggle to accurately identify the structure of the predictive invariant ego-graph and consequently rely on spurious features. To address this, we propose Cross-environment Intra-class Alignment (CIA), which explicitly eliminates spurious features by aligning cross-environment representations conditioned on the same class, bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of the causal pattern structure. To adapt CIA to node-level OOD scenarios where environment labels are hard to obtain, we further propose CIA-LRA (Localized Reweighting Alignment) that leverages the distribution of neighboring labels to selectively align node representations, effectively distinguishing and preserving invariant features while removing spurious ones, all without relying on environment labels. We theoretically prove CIA-LRA's effectiveness by deriving an OOD generalization error bound based on PAC-Bayesian analysis. Experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the superiority of CIA and CIA-LRA, marking a significant advancement in node-level OOD generalization.

> Accurate global glacier mapping is critical for understanding climate change impacts. Despite its importance, automated glacier mapping at a global scale remains largely unexplored. Here we address this gap and propose Glacier-VisionTransformer-U-Net (GlaViTU), a convolutional-transformer deep learning model, and five strategies for multitemporal global-scale glacier mapping using open satellite imagery. Assessing the spatial, temporal and cross-sensor generalisation shows that our best strategy achieves intersection over union >0.85 on previously unobserved images in most cases, which drops to >0.75 for debris-rich areas such as High-Mountain Asia and increases to >0.90 for regions dominated by clean ice. A comparative validation against human expert uncertainties in terms of area and distance deviations underscores GlaViTU performance, approaching or matching expert-level delineation. Adding synthetic aperture radar data, namely, backscatter and interferometric coherence, increases the accuracy in all regions where available. The calibrated confidence for glacier extents is reported making the predictions more reliable and interpretable. We also release a benchmark dataset that covers 9% of glaciers worldwide. Our results support efforts towards automated multitemporal and global glacier mapping.

> As general-purpose tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) must often reason about everyday physical environments. In a question-and-answer capacity, understanding the interactions of physical objects may be necessary to give appropriate responses. Moreover, LLMs are increasingly used as reasoning engines in agentic systems, designing and controlling their action sequences. The vast majority of research has tackled this issue using static benchmarks, comprised of text or image-based questions about the physical world. However, these benchmarks do not capture the complexity and nuance of real-life physical processes. Here we advocate for a second, relatively unexplored, approach: 'embodying' the LLMs by granting them control of an agent within a 3D environment. We present the first embodied and cognitively meaningful evaluation of physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. Our framework allows direct comparison of LLMs with other embodied agents, such as those based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, and human and non-human animals. We employ the Animal-AI (AAI) environment, a simulated 3D virtual laboratory, to study physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. For this, we use the AAI Testbed, a suite of experiments that replicate laboratory studies with non-human animals, to study physical reasoning capabilities including distance estimation, tracking out-of-sight objects, and tool use. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-modal models with no finetuning can complete this style of task, allowing meaningful comparison to the entrants of the 2019 Animal-AI Olympics competition and to human children. Our results show that LLMs are currently outperformed by human children on these tasks. We argue that this approach allows the study of physical reasoning using ecologically valid experiments drawn directly from cognitive science, improving the predictability and reliability of LLMs.

> As advancements in large language models (LLMs) continue and the demand for personalized models increases, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods (e.g., LoRA) will become essential due to their efficiency in reducing computation costs. However, recent studies have raised alarming concerns that LoRA fine-tuning could potentially compromise the safety alignment in LLMs, posing significant risks for the model owner. In this paper, we first investigate the underlying mechanism by analyzing the changes in safety alignment related features before and after fine-tuning. Then, we propose a fixed safety module calculated by safety data and a task-specific initialization for trainable parameters in low-rank adaptations, termed Safety-alignment preserved Low-Rank Adaptation (SaLoRA). Unlike previous LoRA methods and their variants, SaLoRA enables targeted modifications to LLMs without disrupting their original alignments. Our experiments show that SaLoRA outperforms various adapters-based approaches across various evaluation metrics in different fine-tuning tasks.

> This paper introduces LongBench v2, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to handle long-context problems requiring deep understanding and reasoning across real-world multitasks. LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2.

> Deep learning approaches are increasingly used to tackle forecasting tasks involving datasets with multiple univariate time series. A key factor in the successful application of these methods is a large enough training sample size, which is not always available. Synthetic data generation techniques can be applied in these scenarios to augment the dataset. Data augmentation is typically applied offline before training a model. However, when training with mini-batches, some batches may contain a disproportionate number of synthetic samples that do not align well with the original data characteristics. This work introduces an online data augmentation framework that generates synthetic samples during the training of neural networks. By creating synthetic samples for each batch alongside their original counterparts, we maintain a balanced representation between real and synthetic data throughout the training process. This approach fits naturally with the iterative nature of neural network training and eliminates the need to store large augmented datasets. We validated the proposed framework using 3797 time series from 6 benchmark datasets, three neural architectures, and seven synthetic data generation techniques. The experiments suggest that online data augmentation leads to better forecasting performance compared to offline data augmentation or no augmentation approaches. The framework and experiments are publicly available.

> Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large models without costly retraining. Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation. However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt. We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs.

> Traditionally, TD and FQI are viewed as differing in the number of updates toward the target value function: TD makes one update, FQI makes an infinite number, and Partial Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI) performs a finite number, such as the use of a target network in Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in the OPE setting. This perspective, however, fails to capture the convergence connections between these algorithms and may lead to incorrect conclusions, for example, that the convergence of TD implies the convergence of FQI. In this paper, we focus on linear value function approximation and offer a new perspective, unifying TD, FQI, and PFQI as the same iterative method for solving the Least Squares Temporal Difference (LSTD) system, but using different preconditioners and matrix splitting schemes. TD uses a constant preconditioner, FQI employs a data-feature adaptive preconditioner, and PFQI transitions between the two. Then, we reveal that in the context of linear function approximation, increasing the number of updates under the same target value function essentially represents a transition from using a constant preconditioner to data-feature adaptive preconditioner. This unifying perspective also simplifies the analyses of the convergence conditions for these algorithms and clarifies many issues. Consequently, we fully characterize the convergence of each algorithm without assuming specific properties of the chosen features (e.g., linear independence). We also examine how common assumptions about feature representations affect convergence, and discover new conditions on features that are important for convergence. These convergence conditions allow us to establish the convergence connections between these algorithms and to address important questions.

- `2307.10805v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10805v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10805v2)

> This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient split learning (SL) framework, named SplitFC, which reduces the communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate feature and gradient vectors during the SL training process. The key idea of SplitFC is to leverage different dispersion degrees exhibited in the columns of the matrices. SplitFC incorporates two compression strategies: (i) adaptive feature-wise dropout and (ii) adaptive feature-wise quantization. In the first strategy, the intermediate feature vectors are dropped with adaptive dropout probabilities determined based on the standard deviation of these vectors. Then, by the chain rule, the intermediate gradient vectors associated with the dropped feature vectors are also dropped. In the second strategy, the non-dropped intermediate feature and gradient vectors are quantized using adaptive quantization levels determined based on the ranges of the vectors. To minimize the quantization error, the optimal quantization levels of this strategy are derived in a closed-form expression. Simulation results on the MNIST, CIFAR-100, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that SplitFC outperforms state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

> Both graph structures and textual information play a critical role in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). With the success of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) such as BERT, they have been applied for text encoding for KGC. However, the current methods mostly prefer to fine-tune PLMs, leading to huge training costs and limited scalability to larger PLMs. In contrast, we propose to utilize prompts and perform KGC on a frozen PLM with only the prompts trained. Accordingly, we propose a new KGC method named PDKGC with two prompts -- a hard task prompt which is to adapt the KGC task to the PLM pre-training task of token prediction, and a disentangled structure prompt which learns disentangled graph representation so as to enable the PLM to combine more relevant structure knowledge with the text information. With the two prompts, PDKGC builds a textual predictor and a structural predictor, respectively, and their combination leads to more comprehensive entity prediction. Solid evaluation on three widely used KGC datasets has shown that PDKGC often outperforms the baselines including the state-of-the-art, and its components are all effective. Our codes and data are available at https://github.com/genggengcss/PDKGC.

> Exercising regularly is widely recognized as a cornerstone of health, yet the challenge of sustaining consistent exercise habits persists. Understanding the factors that influence the formation of these habits is crucial for developing effective interventions. This study utilizes data from Mars Athletic Club, T\"urkiye's largest sports chain, to investigate the dynamics of gym attendance and habit formation. The general problem addressed by this study is identifying the critical periods and factors that contribute to the successful establishment of consistent exercise routines among gym-goers. Here we show that there are specific periods during which gym attendance is most crucial for habit formation. By developing a survival metric based on gym attendance patterns, we pinpoint these critical periods and segment members into distinct clusters based on their visit patterns. Our analysis reveals significant differences in how various subgroups respond to interventions, such as group classes, personal trainer sessions, and visiting different clubs. Using causal inference analysis, we demonstrate that personalized guidance and social dynamics are key drivers of sustained long-term engagement. By systematically examining these variables and considering the specific characteristics of different clusters, our research demonstrates the importance of a tailored, multi-dimensional approach to promoting exercise habits, which integrates social dynamics, personalized guidance, and strategic interventions to sustain long-term engagement.

> Clouds play a key role in Earth's radiation balance with complex effects that introduce large uncertainties into climate models. Real-time 3D cloud data is essential for improving climate predictions. This study leverages geostationary imagery from MSG/SEVIRI and radar reflectivity measurements of cloud profiles from CloudSat/CPR to reconstruct 3D cloud structures. We first apply self-supervised learning (SSL) methods-Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and geospatially-aware SatMAE on unlabelled MSG images, and then fine-tune our models on matched image-profile pairs. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods like U-Nets, and our geospatial encoding further improves prediction results, demonstrating the potential of SSL for cloud reconstruction.

- `2501.01235v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01235v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01235v2)

> Face Restoration (FR) is a crucial area within image and video processing, focusing on reconstructing high-quality portraits from degraded inputs. Despite advancements in image FR, video FR remains relatively under-explored, primarily due to challenges related to temporal consistency, motion artifacts, and the limited availability of high-quality video data. Moreover, traditional face restoration typically prioritizes enhancing resolution and may not give as much consideration to related tasks such as facial colorization and inpainting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the Generalized Video Face Restoration (GVFR) task, which integrates video BFR, inpainting, and colorization tasks that we empirically show to benefit each other. We present a unified framework, termed as stable video face restoration (SVFR), which leverages the generative and motion priors of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) and incorporates task-specific information through a unified face restoration framework. A learnable task embedding is introduced to enhance task identification. Meanwhile, a novel Unified Latent Regularization (ULR) is employed to encourage the shared feature representation learning among different subtasks. To further enhance the restoration quality and temporal stability, we introduce the facial prior learning and the self-referred refinement as auxiliary strategies used for both training and inference. The proposed framework effectively combines the complementary strengths of these tasks, enhancing temporal coherence and achieving superior restoration quality. This work advances the state-of-the-art in video FR and establishes a new paradigm for generalized video face restoration.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising learning and reasoning abilities. Compared to other NLP tasks, multilingual and multi-label emotion evaluation tasks are under-explored in LLMs. In this paper, we present EthioEmo, a multi-label emotion classification dataset for four Ethiopian languages, namely, Amharic (amh), Afan Oromo (orm), Somali (som), and Tigrinya (tir). We perform extensive experiments with an additional English multi-label emotion dataset from SemEval 2018 Task 1. Our evaluation includes encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only language models. We compare zero and few-shot approaches of LLMs to fine-tuning smaller language models. The results show that accurate multi-label emotion classification is still insufficient even for high-resource languages such as English, and there is a large gap between the performance of high-resource and low-resource languages. The results also show varying performance levels depending on the language and model type. EthioEmo is available publicly to further improve the understanding of emotions in language models and how people convey emotions through various languages.

- `2501.01785v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01785v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01785v1)

> The increasing use of machine learning in learning analytics (LA) has raised significant concerns around algorithmic fairness and privacy. Synthetic data has emerged as a dual-purpose tool, enhancing privacy and improving fairness in LA models. However, prior research suggests an inverse relationship between fairness and privacy, making it challenging to optimize both. This study investigates which synthetic data generators can best balance privacy and fairness, and whether pre-processing fairness algorithms, typically applied to real datasets, are effective on synthetic data. Our results highlight that the DEbiasing CAusal Fairness (DECAF) algorithm achieves the best balance between privacy and fairness. However, DECAF suffers in utility, as reflected in its predictive accuracy. Notably, we found that applying pre-processing fairness algorithms to synthetic data improves fairness even more than when applied to real data. These findings suggest that combining synthetic data generation with fairness pre-processing offers a promising approach to creating fairer LA models.

> This paper addresses the challenge of balancing learner data privacy with the use of data in learning analytics (LA) by proposing a novel framework by applying Differential Privacy (DP). The need for more robust privacy protection keeps increasing, driven by evolving legal regulations and heightened privacy concerns, as well as traditional anonymization methods being insufficient for the complexities of educational data. To address this, we introduce the first DP framework specifically designed for LA and provide practical guidance for its implementation. We demonstrate the use of this framework through a LA usage scenario and validate DP in safeguarding data privacy against potential attacks through an experiment on a well-known LA dataset. Additionally, we explore the trade-offs between data privacy and utility across various DP settings. Our work contributes to the field of LA by offering a practical DP framework that can support researchers and practitioners in adopting DP in their works.

> In this study, we explore the growing potential of AI and deep learning technologies, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), for generating synthetic tabular data. Access to quality students data is critical for advancing learning analytics, but privacy concerns and stricter data protection regulations worldwide limit their availability and usage. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative. We investigate whether synthetic data can be leveraged to create artificial students for serving learning analytics models. Using the popular GAN model CTGAN and three LLMs- GPT2, DistilGPT2, and DialoGPT, we generate synthetic tabular student data. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of these methods to produce high-quality synthetic datasets that resemble real students data. To validate our findings, we apply a comprehensive set of utility evaluation metrics to assess the statistical and predictive performance of the synthetic data and compare the different generator models used, specially the performance of LLMs. Our study aims to provide the learning analytics community with valuable insights into the use of synthetic data, laying the groundwork for expanding the field methodological toolbox with new innovative approaches for learning analytics data generation.

> Deep clustering is an essential task in modern artificial intelligence, aiming to partition a set of data samples into a given number of homogeneous groups (i.e., clusters). Even though many Deep Neural Network (DNN) backbones and clustering strategies have been proposed for the task, achieving increasingly improved performance, deep clustering remains very challenging due to the lack of accurately labeled samples. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of deep clustering via community detection. It initializes clustering by detecting many communities, and then gradually expands clusters by community merging. Compared with the existing clustering strategies, community detection factors in the new perspective of cluster network analysis. As a result, it has the inherent benefit of high pseudo-label purity, which is critical to the performance of self-supervision. We have validated the efficacy of the proposed approach on benchmark image datasets. Our extensive experiments have shown that it can effectively improve the SOTA performance. Our ablation study also demonstrates that the new network perspective can effectively improve community pseudo-label purity, resulting in improved clustering performance.

> The $\ell_p$ subspace approximation problem is an NP-hard low rank approximation problem that generalizes the median hyperplane problem ($p = 1$), principal component analysis ($p = 2$), and the center hyperplane problem ($p = \infty$). A popular approach to cope with the NP-hardness of this problem is to compute a strong coreset, which is a small weighted subset of the input points which simultaneously approximates the cost of every $k$-dimensional subspace, typically to $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error for a small constant $\varepsilon$.   We obtain the first algorithm for constructing a strong coreset for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation with a nearly optimal dependence on the rank parameter $k$, obtaining a nearly linear bound of $\tilde O(k)\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ for $p<2$ and $\tilde O(k^{p/2})\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ for $p>2$. Prior constructions either achieved a similar size bound but produced a coreset with a modification of the original points [SW18, FKW21], or produced a coreset of the original points but lost $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ factors in the coreset size [HV20, WY23].   Our techniques also lead to the first nearly optimal online strong coresets for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation with similar bounds as the offline setting, resolving a problem of [WY23]. All prior approaches lose $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ factors in this setting, even when allowed to modify the original points.

> Accurately measuring protein-RNA binding affinity is crucial in many biological processes and drug design. Previous computational methods for protein-RNA binding affinity prediction rely on either sequence or structure features, unable to capture the binding mechanisms comprehensively. The recent emerging pre-trained language models trained on massive unsupervised sequences of protein and RNA have shown strong representation ability for various in-domain downstream tasks, including binding site prediction. However, applying different-domain language models collaboratively for complex-level tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose CoPRA to bridge pre-trained language models from different biological domains via Complex structure for Protein-RNA binding Affinity prediction. We demonstrate for the first time that cross-biological modal language models can collaborate to improve binding affinity prediction. We propose a Co-Former to combine the cross-modal sequence and structure information and a bi-scope pre-training strategy for improving Co-Former's interaction understanding. Meanwhile, we build the largest protein-RNA binding affinity dataset PRA310 for performance evaluation. We also test our model on a public dataset for mutation effect prediction. CoPRA reaches state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets. We provide extensive analyses and verify that CoPRA can (1) accurately predict the protein-RNA binding affinity; (2) understand the binding affinity change caused by mutations; and (3) benefit from scaling data and model size.

> Multi-label classification, which involves assigning multiple labels to a single input, has emerged as a key area in both research and industry due to its wide-ranging applications. Designing effective loss functions is crucial for optimizing deep neural networks for this task, as they significantly influence model performance and efficiency. Traditional loss functions, which often maximize likelihood under the assumption of label independence, may struggle to capture complex label relationships. Recent research has turned to supervised contrastive learning, a method that aims to create a structured representation space by bringing similar instances closer together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. Although contrastive learning offers a promising approach, applying it to multi-label classification presents unique challenges, particularly in managing label interactions and data structure.   In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of contrastive learning loss for multi-label classification across diverse settings. These include datasets with both small and large numbers of labels, datasets with varying amounts of training data, and applications in both computer vision and natural language processing.   Our empirical results indicate that the promising outcomes of contrastive learning are attributable not only to the consideration of label interactions but also to the robust optimization scheme of the contrastive loss. Furthermore, while the supervised contrastive loss function faces challenges with datasets containing a small number of labels and ranking-based metrics, it demonstrates excellent performance, particularly in terms of Macro-F1, on datasets with a large number of labels.

We also give low-space streaming algorithms for John ellipsoids using similar ideas.

> Systematic literature reviews (SLR) have been increasingly conducted in software engineering and they provide significant benefits in terms of summarizing the state of the research. The process of conducting SLR is complex, involving several activities and consuming considerable effort and time from researchers. Researchers often skip or poorly conduct essential activities, which introduce threats to validity, resulting in lower-quality SLR. But researchers are often unaware of what they could do to mature their SLR process, thus improving the SLR quality. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a maturity model for the SLR process named MM4SLR. To this end, we were inspired by well-known models like CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration). We first identified 39 key practices for SLR from the literature and grouped them into nine goals that were further grouped into five process areas. We then organized the process areas into five maturity levels which compose our model. Our proof of concept, applying the MM4SLR to four published SLR showed that the MM4SLR is suitable for appraising SLR and can identify important flaws in SLR quality. MM4SLR can therefore support researchers in creating their SLR processes and selecting practices that could be adopted to mature their processes.

> Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) is an advanced wireless communication technology, using a large number of antennas to improve the overall performance of the communication system in terms of capacity, spectral, and energy efficiency. The performance of MIMO systems is highly dependent on the quality of channel state information (CSI). Predicting CSI is, therefore, essential for improving communication system performance, particularly in MIMO systems, since it represents key characteristics of a wireless channel, including propagation, fading, scattering, and path loss. This study proposes a foundation model inspired by BERT, called BERT4MIMO, which is specifically designed to process high-dimensional CSI data from massive MIMO systems. BERT4MIMO offers superior performance in reconstructing CSI under varying mobility scenarios and channel conditions through deep learning and attention mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BERT4MIMO in a variety of wireless environments.

However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving~\footnote{Our code are available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multimodal_textbook}}.

> Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial in drug discovery, particularly during hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases, however, limitations in ligand force fields continue to impact prediction accuracy. In this work, we validate relative binding free energy (RBFE) accuracy using neural network potentials (NNPs) for the ligands. We utilize a novel NNP model, AceForce 1.0, based on the TensorNet architecture for small molecules that broadens the applicability to diverse drug-like compounds, including all important chemical elements and supporting charged molecules. Using established benchmarks, we show overall improved accuracy and correlation in binding affinity predictions compared with GAFF2 for molecular mechanics and ANI2-x for NNPs. Slightly less accuracy but comparable correlations with OPLS4. We also show that we can run the NNP simulations at 2 fs timestep, at least two times larger than previous NNP models, providing significant speed gains. The results show promise for further evolutions of free energy calculations using NNPs while demonstrating its practical use already with the current generation. The code and NNP model are publicly available for research use.

> This study proposes a novel lightweight neural network model leveraging features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals for early OSA screening. ECG signals are used to generate feature spectrograms to predict sleep stages, while respiratory signals are employed to detect sleep-related breathing abnormalities. By integrating these predictions, the method calculates the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with enhanced accuracy, facilitating precise OSA diagnosis.   The method was validated on three publicly available sleep apnea databases: the Apnea-ECG database, the UCDDB dataset, and the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic database. Results showed an overall OSA detection accuracy of 0.978, highlighting the model's robustness. Respiratory event classification achieved an accuracy of 0.969 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.98. For sleep stage classification, in UCDDB dataset, the ROC-AUC exceeded 0.85 across all stages, with recall for Sleep reaching 0.906 and specificity for REM and Wake states at 0.956 and 0.937, respectively.   This study underscores the potential of integrating lightweight neural networks with multi-signal analysis for accurate, portable, and cost-effective OSA screening, paving the way for broader adoption in home-based and wearable health monitoring systems.

> LLM routers aim to balance quality and cost of generation by classifying queries and routing them to a cheaper or more expensive LLM depending on their complexity. Routers represent one type of what we call LLM control planes: systems that orchestrate use of one or more LLMs. In this paper, we investigate routers' adversarial robustness.   We first define LLM control plane integrity, i.e., robustness of LLM orchestration to adversarial inputs, as a distinct problem in AI safety. Next, we demonstrate that an adversary can generate query-independent token sequences we call ``confounder gadgets'' that, when added to any query, cause LLM routers to send the query to a strong LLM.   Our quantitative evaluation shows that this attack is successful both in white-box and black-box settings against a variety of open-source and commercial routers, and that confounding queries do not affect the quality of LLM responses. Finally, we demonstrate that gadgets can be effective while maintaining low perplexity, thus perplexity-based filtering is not an effective defense. We finish by investigating alternative defenses.

> Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are a widely employed research method in software engineering. However, there are several problems with SLRs, including the enormous time and effort to conduct them and the lack of obvious impacts of SLR results on software engineering practices and industry projects. To address these problems, the concepts of \textit{sustainability} and \textit{sustainable SLR} have been proposed, aiming to raise awareness among researchers about the importance of dealing with SLR problems in a consistent way; however, practical and concrete actions are still lacking. This paper presents concrete directions towards sustainable SLRs. We first identified 18 ``green drivers'' (GD) that could directly impact SLR sustainability, and we distilled 25 sustainability indicators (SI) associated with the GD to assess SLRs regarding their sustainability. A preliminary evaluation was conducted on the ten top-cited SLRs in software engineering published over the last decade. From this analysis, we synthesized our insights into 12 leverage points for sustainability. Our results indicate that even in high-quality reviews, there are threats to sustainability, such as: flaws in the search process, lack of essential details in the documentation, weak collaboration with stakeholders, poor knowledge management, lack of use of supporting tools, and a dearth of practical insights for software engineering practitioners. The good news is that moving towards sustainable SLRs only requires some simple actions, which can pave the way for a profound change in the software engineering community's mindset about how to create and sustain SLRs.

> Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is an important application across many fields. There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, GLinear, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It also provides better prediction accuracy by using a smaller amount of historical data compared to other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictor (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being parametrically efficient, significantly outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF. We hope that the proposed GLinear opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.

> This paper proposes a data preparation process for managing real-world kinematic data and detecting fishing vessels. The solution is a binary classification that classifies ship trajectories into either fishing or non-fishing ships. The data used are characterized by the typical problems found in classic data mining applications using real-world data, such as noise and inconsistencies. The two classes are also clearly unbalanced in the data, a problem which is addressed using algorithms that resample the instances. For classification, a series of features are extracted from spatiotemporal data that represent the trajectories of the ships, available from sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports. These features are proposed for the modelling of ship behavior but, because they do not contain context-related information, the classification can be applied in other scenarios. Experimentation shows that the proposed data preparation process is useful for the presented classification problem. In addition, positive results are obtained using minimal information.

> There exists a plethora of parametric models for positive definite kernels, and their use is ubiquitous in disciplines as diverse as statistics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and approximation theory. Usually, the kernel parameters index certain features of an associated process. Amongst those features, smoothness (in the sense of Sobolev spaces, mean square differentiability, and fractal dimensions), compact or global supports, and negative dependencies (hole effects) are of interest to several theoretical and applied disciplines. This paper unifies a wealth of well-known kernels into a single parametric class that encompasses them as special cases, attained either by exact parameterization or through parametric asymptotics. We furthermore characterize the Sobolev space that is norm equivalent to the RKHS associated with the new kernel. As a by-product, we infer the Sobolev spaces that are associated with existing classes of kernels. We illustrate the main properties of the new class, show how this class can switch from compact to global supports, and provide special cases for which the kernel attains negative values over nontrivial intervals. Hence, the proposed class of kernel is the reproducing kernel of a very rich Hilbert space that contains many special cases, including the celebrated Mat\'ern and Wendland kernels, as well as their aliases with hole effects.

> How can Transformers model and learn enumerative geometry? What is a robust procedure for using Transformers in abductive knowledge discovery within a mathematician-machine collaboration? In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based approach to computational enumerative geometry, specifically targeting the computation of $\psi$-class intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves. By reformulating the problem as a continuous optimization task, we compute intersection numbers across a wide value range from $10^{-45}$ to $10^{45}$. To capture the recursive nature inherent in these intersection numbers, we propose the Dynamic Range Activator (DRA), a new activation function that enhances the Transformer's ability to model recursive patterns and handle severe heteroscedasticity. Given precision requirements for computing the intersections, we quantify the uncertainty of the predictions using Conformal Prediction with a dynamic sliding window adaptive to the partitions of equivalent number of marked points. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on modeling recursive functions with such a high-variance and factorial growth. Beyond simply computing intersection numbers, we explore the enumerative "world-model" of Transformers. Our interpretability analysis reveals that the network is implicitly modeling the Virasoro constraints in a purely data-driven manner. Moreover, through abductive hypothesis testing, probing, and causal inference, we uncover evidence of an emergent internal representation of the the large-genus asymptotic of $\psi$-class intersection numbers. These findings suggest that the network internalizes the parameters of the asymptotic closed-form and the polynomiality phenomenon of $\psi$-class intersection numbers in a non-linear manner.

> Recently, over-the-air federated learning (FL) has attracted significant attention for its ability to enhance communication efficiency. However, the performance of over-the-air FL is often constrained by device selection strategies and signal aggregation errors. In particular, neglecting straggler devices in FL can lead to a decline in the fairness of model updates and amplify the global model's bias toward certain devices' data, ultimately impacting the overall system performance. To address this issue, we propose a joint device selection and transmit power optimization framework that ensures the appropriate participation of straggler devices, maintains efficient training performance, and guarantees timely updates. First, we conduct a theoretical analysis to quantify the convergence upper bound of over-the-air FL under age-of-information (AoI)-based device selection. Our analysis further reveals that both the number of selected devices and the signal aggregation errors significantly influence the convergence upper bound. To minimize the expected weighted sum peak age of information, we calculate device priorities for each communication round using Lyapunov optimization and select the highest-priority devices via a greedy algorithm. Then, we formulate and solve a transmit power and normalizing factor optimization problem for selected devices to minimize the time-average mean squared error (MSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method offers two significant advantages: (1) it reduces MSE and improves model performance compared to baseline methods, and (2) it strikes a balance between fairness and training efficiency while maintaining satisfactory timeliness, ensuring stable model performance.

> Automated red-teaming has become a crucial approach for uncovering vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, most existing methods focus on isolated safety flaws, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic defenses and uncover complex vulnerabilities efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose Auto-RT, a reinforcement learning framework that automatically explores and optimizes complex attack strategies to effectively uncover security vulnerabilities through malicious queries. Specifically, we introduce two key mechanisms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization: 1) Early-terminated Exploration, which accelerate exploration by focusing on high-potential attack strategies; and 2) Progressive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate downgrade models, which dynamically refine the search trajectory toward successful vulnerability exploitation. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that, by significantly improving exploration efficiency and automatically optimizing attack strategies, Auto-RT detects a boarder range of vulnerabilities, achieving a faster detection speed and 16.63\% higher success rates compared to existing methods.

> Image-based systems have gained popularity owing to their capacity to provide rich manufacturing status information, low implementation costs and high acquisition rates. However, the complexity of the image background and various anomaly patterns pose new challenges to existing matrix decomposition methods, which are inadequate for modeling requirements. Moreover, the uncertainty of the anomaly can cause anomaly contamination problems, making the designed model and method highly susceptible to external disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage strategy anomaly detection method that detects anomalies by identifying suspected patches (Ano-SuPs). Specifically, we propose to detect the patches with anomalies by reconstructing the input image twice: the first step is to obtain a set of normal patches by removing those suspected patches, and the second step is to use those normal patches to refine the identification of the patches with anomalies. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate the proposed method systematically through simulation experiments and case studies. We further identified the key parameters and designed steps that impact the model's performance and efficiency.

> The automatic generation of representative natural language descriptions for observable patterns in time series data enhances interpretability, simplifies analysis and increases cross-domain utility of temporal data. While pre-trained foundation models have made considerable progress in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their application to time series analysis has been hindered by data scarcity. Although several large language model (LLM)-based methods have been proposed for time series forecasting, time series captioning is under-explored in the context of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce TSLM, a novel time series language model designed specifically for time series captioning. TSLM operates as an encoder-decoder model, leveraging both text prompts and time series data representations to capture subtle temporal patterns across multiple phases and generate precise textual descriptions of time series inputs. TSLM addresses the data scarcity problem in time series captioning by first leveraging an in-context prompting synthetic data generation, and second denoising the generated data via a novel cross-modal dense retrieval scoring applied to time series-caption pairs. Experimental findings on various time series captioning datasets demonstrate that TSLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches from multiple data modalities by a significant margin.

> Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we called \textbf{MoColl}, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.

> Based on limited observations, machine learning discerns a dependence which is expected to hold in the future. What makes it possible? Statistical learning theory imagines indefinitely increasing training sample to justify its approach. In reality, there is no infinite time or even infinite general population for learning. Here I argue that practical machine learning is based on an implicit assumption that underlying dependence is relatively ``smooth" : likely, there are no abrupt differences in feedback between cases with close data points. From this point of view learning shall involve selection of the hypothesis ``smoothly" approximating the training set. I formalize this as Practical learning paradigm. The paradigm includes terminology and rules for description of learners. Popular learners (local smoothing, k-NN, decision trees, Naive Bayes, SVM for classification and for regression) are shown here to be implementations of this paradigm.

> We introduce the spiked mixture model (SMM) to address the problem of estimating a set of signals from many randomly scaled and noisy observations. Subsequently, we design a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to recover all parameters of the SMM. Numerical experiments show that in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, and for data types where the SMM is relevant, SMM surpasses the more traditional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in terms of signal recovery performance. The broad relevance of the SMM and its corresponding EM recovery algorithm is demonstrated by applying the technique to different data types. The first case study is a biomedical research application, utilizing an imaging mass spectrometry dataset to explore the molecular content of a rat brain tissue section at micrometer scale. The second case study demonstrates SMM performance in a computer vision application, segmenting a hyperspectral imaging dataset into underlying patterns. While the measurement modalities differ substantially, in both case studies SMM is shown to recover signals that were missed by traditional methods such as k-means clustering and GMM.

> Real-world data often contains intrinsic ambiguity that the common single-hard-label annotation paradigm ignores. Standard training using ambiguous data with these hard labels may produce overly confident models and thus leading to poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Quantized Label Learning (QLL) to alleviate this issue. First, we formulate QLL as learning from (very) ambiguous data with hard labels: ideally, each ambiguous instance should be associated with a ground-truth soft-label distribution describing its corresponding probabilistic weight in each class, however, this is usually not accessible; in practice, we can only observe a quantized label, i.e., a hard label sampled (quantized) from the corresponding ground-truth soft-label distribution, of each instance, which can be seen as a biased approximation of the ground-truth soft-label. Second, we propose a Class-wise Positive-Unlabeled (CPU) risk estimator that allows us to train accurate classifiers from only ambiguous data with quantized labels. Third, to simulate ambiguous datasets with quantized labels in the real world, we design a mixing-based ambiguous data generation procedure for empirical evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our CPU method can significantly improve model generalization performance and outperform the baselines.

This has paved the way for the emergence of LM-based code optimization techniques, which are crucial for enhancing the performance of existing programs, such as accelerating program execution time. However, a comprehensive survey dedicated to this specific application has been lacking.

Our findings reveal five critical open challenges, such as balancing model complexity with practical usability, cross-language/performance generalizability, and building trust in AI-driven solutions. Furthermore, we provide eight future research directions to facilitate more efficient, robust, and reliable LM-based code optimization. Thereby, this study aims to provide actionable insights and foundational references for both researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.

> The remarkable generative capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically generating responses for different applications. Given the dynamic nature of user preferences and the uncertainty of LLM response performance, it is crucial to design efficient online learning algorithms to identify optimal LLM responses (i.e., high-quality responses that also meet user preferences). Most existing online algorithms adopt a centralized approach and fail to leverage explicit user preferences for more efficient and personalized LLM response identification. In contrast, this paper introduces \textit{MACO} (\underline{M}ulti-\underline{A}gent \underline{C}onversational \underline{O}nline Learning for Adaptive LLM Response Identification): 1) The online LLM response identification process is accelerated by multiple local agents (such as smartphones), while enhancing data privacy; 2) A novel conversational mechanism is proposed to adaptively conduct conversations for soliciting user preferences (e.g., a preference for a humorous tone over a serious one in generated responses), so to minimize uncertainty in preference estimation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that \cadi\ is near-optimal regarding cumulative regret. Additionally, \cadi\ offers reduced communication costs and computational complexity by eliminating the traditional, computing-intensive ``G-optimal design" found in previous works. Extensive experiments with the open LLM \textit{Llama}, coupled with two different embedding models from Google and OpenAI for text vector representation, demonstrate that \cadi\ significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in online LLM response identification.

> Clustered federated learning (CFL) addresses the performance challenges posed by data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) by organizing edge devices with similar data distributions into clusters, enabling collaborative model training tailored to each group. However, existing CFL approaches strictly limit knowledge sharing to within clusters, lacking the integration of global knowledge with intra-cluster training, which leads to suboptimal performance. Moreover, traditional clustering methods incur significant computational overhead, especially as the number of edge devices increases. In this paper, we propose LCFed, an efficient CFL framework to combat these challenges. By leveraging model partitioning and adopting distinct aggregation strategies for each sub-model, LCFed effectively incorporates global knowledge into intra-cluster co-training, achieving optimal training performance. Additionally, LCFed customizes a computationally efficient model similarity measurement method based on low-rank models, enabling real-time cluster updates with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments show that LCFed outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in both test accuracy and clustering computational efficiency.

> The modeling of deposition rates in Thermal Laser Epitaxy (TLE) is essential for the accurate prediction of the evaporation process and for improved dynamic process control. We demonstrate excellent agreement between experimental data and a model based on a finite element simulation that describes the temperature distribution of an elemental source when irradiated with continuous wave laser radiation. The simulation strongly depends on the thermophysical constants of the material, data of which is lacking for many elements. Effective values for the parameters may be determined with precision by means of an unambiguous reference provided by the melting point of the material, which is directly observed during the experiments. TLE may therefore be used to study the high temperature thermophysical and optical properties of the elements.

> Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.

> Street View Imagery (SVI) has emerged as a valuable data form in urban studies, enabling new ways to map and sense urban environments. However, fundamental concerns regarding the representativeness, quality, and reliability of SVI remain underexplored, e.g. to what extent can cities be captured by such data and do data gaps result in bias. This research, positioned at the intersection of spatial data quality and urban analytics, addresses these concerns by proposing a novel and effective method to estimate SVI's element-level coverage in the urban environment. The method integrates the positional relationships between SVI and target elements, as well as the impact of physical obstructions. Expanding the domain of data quality to SVI, we introduce an indicator system that evaluates the extent of coverage, focusing on the completeness and frequency dimensions. Taking London as a case study, three experiments are conducted to identify potential biases in SVI's ability to cover and represent urban environmental elements, using building facades as an example. It is found that despite their high availability along urban road networks, Google Street View covers only 62.4% of buildings in the case study area. The average facade coverage per building is 12.4%. SVI tends to over-represent non-residential buildings, thus possibly resulting in biased analyses, and its coverage of environmental elements is position-dependent. The research also highlights the variability of SVI coverage under different data acquisition practices and proposes an optimal sampling interval range of 50-60 m for SVI collection. The findings suggest that while SVI offers valuable insights, it is no panacea - its application in urban research requires careful consideration of data coverage and element-level representativeness to ensure reliable results.

> With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the model robustness has become a significant research hotspot, \ie, adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. Existing works primarily focus on image classification tasks, aiming to alter the model's predicted labels. Due to the output complexity and deeper network architectures, research on adversarial examples for segmentation models is still limited, particularly for universal adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel universal adversarial attack method designed for segmentation models, which includes dual feature separation and low-frequency scattering modules. The two modules guide the training of adversarial examples in the pixel and frequency space, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high attack success rates surpassing the state-of-the-art methods, and exhibits strong transferability across different models.

> Despite significant efforts to align large language models with human values and ethical guidelines, these models remain susceptible to sophisticated jailbreak attacks that exploit their reasoning capabilities. Traditional safety mechanisms often focus on detecting explicit malicious intent, leaving deeper vulnerabilities unaddressed. In this work, we introduce a jailbreak technique, POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), which leverages contrastive reasoning to elicit unethical responses. POATE generates prompts with semantically opposite intents and combines them with adversarial templates to subtly direct models toward producing harmful responses. We conduct extensive evaluations across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes, including LLaMA3, Gemma2, Phi3, and GPT-4, to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. We evaluate our proposed attack against seven safety defenses, revealing their limitations in addressing reasoning-based vulnerabilities. To counteract this, we propose a defense strategy that improves reasoning robustness through chain-of-thought prompting and reverse thinking, mitigating reasoning-driven adversarial exploits.

> In this paper we apply mutation testing in an in-time fashion, i.e., across multiple project releases. Thus, we investigate how the mutants of the current version behave in the future versions of the programs. We study the characteristics of what we call latent mutants, i.e., the mutants that are live in one version and killed in later revisions, and explore whether they are predictable with these properties. We examine 131,308 mutants generated by Pitest on 13 open-source projects. Around 11.2% of these mutants are live, and 3.5% of them are latent, manifesting in 104 days on average. Using the mutation operators and change-related features we successfully demonstrate that these latent mutants are identifiable, predicting them with an accuracy of 86% and a balanced accuracy of 67% using a simple random forest classifier.

> Decision-focused learning (DFL) offers an end-to-end approach to the predict-then-optimize (PO) framework by training predictive models directly on decision loss (DL), enhancing decision-making performance within PO contexts. However, the implementation of DFL poses distinct challenges. Primarily, DL can result in deviation from the physical significance of the predictions under limited data. Additionally, some predictive models are non-differentiable or black-box, which cannot be adjusted using gradient-based methods. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decision-Focused Fine-tuning (DFF), which embeds the DFL module into the PO pipeline via a novel bias correction module. DFF is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that maintains the proximity of the DL-enhanced model to the original predictive model within a defined trust region. We theoretically prove that DFF strictly confines prediction bias within a predetermined upper bound, even with limited datasets, thereby substantially reducing prediction shifts caused by DL under limited data. Furthermore, the bias correction module can be integrated into diverse predictive models, enhancing adaptability to a broad range of PO tasks. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets, including network flow, portfolio optimization, and resource allocation problems with different predictive models, demonstrate that DFF not only improves decision performance but also adheres to fine-tuning constraints, showcasing robust adaptability across various scenarios.

> To ease the expensive measurements during configuration tuning, it is natural to build a surrogate model as the replacement of the system, and thereby the configuration performance can be cheaply evaluated. Yet, a stereotype therein is that the higher the model accuracy, the better the tuning result would be. This "accuracy is all" belief drives our research community to build more and more accurate models and criticize a tuner for the inaccuracy of the model used. However, this practice raises some previously unaddressed questions, e.g., Do those somewhat small accuracy improvements reported in existing work really matter much to the tuners? What role does model accuracy play in the impact of tuning quality? To answer those related questions, we conduct one of the largest-scale empirical studies to date-running over the period of 13 months 24*7-that covers 10 models, 17 tuners, and 29 systems from the existing works while under four different commonly used metrics, leading to 13,612 cases of investigation. Surprisingly, our key findings reveal that the accuracy can lie: there are a considerable number of cases where higher accuracy actually leads to no improvement in the tuning outcomes (up to 58% cases under certain setting), or even worse, it can degrade the tuning quality (up to 24% cases under certain setting). We also discover that the chosen models in most proposed tuners are sub-optimal and that the required % of accuracy change to significantly improve tuning quality varies according to the range of model accuracy. Deriving from the fitness landscape analysis, we provide in-depth discussions of the rationale behind, offering several lessons learned as well as insights for future opportunities. Most importantly, this work poses a clear message to the community: we should take one step back from the natural "accuracy is all" belief for model-based configuration tuning.

> We introduce NNsight and NDIF, technologies that work in tandem to enable scientific study of very large neural networks. NNsight is an open-source system that extends PyTorch to introduce deferred remote execution. NDIF is a scalable inference service that executes NNsight requests, allowing users to share GPU resources and pretrained models. These technologies are enabled by the intervention graph, an architecture developed to decouple experiment design from model runtime. Together, this framework provides transparent and efficient access to the internals of deep neural networks such as very large language models (LLMs) without imposing the cost or complexity of hosting customized models individually. We conduct a quantitative survey of the machine learning literature that reveals a growing gap in the study of the internals of large-scale AI. We demonstrate the design and use of our framework to address this gap by enabling a range of research methods on huge models. Finally, we conduct benchmarks to compare performance with previous approaches. Code documentation, and materials are available at https://nnsight.net/.

> Data curation is a field with origins in librarianship and archives, whose scholarship and thinking on data issues go back centuries, if not millennia. The field of machine learning is increasingly observing the importance of data curation to the advancement of both applications and fundamental understanding of machine learning models - evidenced not least by the creation of the Datasets and Benchmarks track itself. This work provides an analysis of dataset development practices at NeurIPS through the lens of data curation. We present an evaluation framework for dataset documentation, consisting of a rubric and toolkit developed through a literature review of data curation principles. We use the framework to assess the strengths and weaknesses in current dataset development practices of 60 datasets published in the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track from 2021-2023. We summarize key findings and trends. Results indicate greater need for documentation about environmental footprint, ethical considerations, and data management. We suggest targeted strategies and resources to improve documentation in these areas and provide recommendations for the NeurIPS peer-review process that prioritize rigorous data curation in ML. Finally, we provide results in the format of a dataset that showcases aspects of recommended data curation practices. Our rubric and results are of interest for improving data curation practices broadly in the field of ML as well as to data curation and science and technology studies scholars studying practices in ML. Our aim is to support continued improvement in interdisciplinary research on dataset practices, ultimately improving the reusability and reproducibility of new datasets and benchmarks, enabling standardized and informed human oversight, and strengthening the foundation of rigorous and responsible ML research.

> Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can significantly promote the advances in road transport mobility in terms of safety, reliability, and decarbonization. However, ensuring safety and efficiency in interactive during within dynamic and diverse environments is still a primary barrier to large-scale AV adoption. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an advanced AI-based approach, enabling AVs to learn decision-making strategies adaptively from data and interactions. DRL strategies are better suited than traditional rule-based methods for handling complex, dynamic, and unpredictable driving environments due to their adaptivity. However, varying driving scenarios present distinct challenges, such as avoiding obstacles on highways and reaching specific exits at intersections, requiring different scenario-specific decision-making algorithms. Many DRL algorithms have been proposed in interactive decision-making. However, a rationale review of these DRL algorithms across various scenarios is lacking. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation is essential to assess these algorithms from multiple perspectives, including those of vehicle users and vehicle manufacturers. This survey reviews the application of DRL algorithms in autonomous driving across typical scenarios, summarizing road features and recent advancements. The scenarios include highways, on-ramp merging, roundabouts, and unsignalized intersections. Furthermore, DRL-based algorithms are evaluated based on five rationale criteria: driving safety, driving efficiency, training efficiency, unselfishness, and interpretability (DDTUI). Each criterion of DDTUI is specifically analyzed in relation to the reviewed algorithms. Finally, the challenges for future DRL-based decision-making algorithms are summarized.

> The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

> Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ``real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development.

> This paper explores the complex tradeoffs between various fairness metrics such as equalized odds, disparate impact, and equal opportunity and predictive accuracy within COMPAS by building neural networks trained with custom loss functions optimized to specific fairness criteria. This paper creates the first fairness-driven implementation of the novel Group Accuracy Parity (GAP) framework, as theoretically proposed by Gupta et al. (2024), and applies it to COMPAS. To operationalize and accurately compare the fairness of COMPAS models optimized to differing fairness ideals, this paper develops and proposes a combinatory analytical procedure that incorporates Pareto front and multivariate analysis, leveraging data visualizations such as violin graphs. This paper concludes that GAP achieves an enhanced equilibrium between fairness and accuracy compared to COMPAS's current nationwide implementation and alternative implementations of COMPAS optimized to more traditional fairness definitions. While this paper's algorithmic improvements of COMPAS significantly augment its fairness, external biases undermine the fairness of its implementation. Practices such as predictive policing and issues such as the lack of transparency regarding COMPAS's internal workings have contributed to the algorithm's historical injustice. In conjunction with developments regarding COMPAS's predictive methodology, legal and institutional changes must happen for COMPAS's just deployment.

> Organic synthesis stands as a cornerstone of the chemical industry. The development of robust machine learning models to support tasks associated with organic reactions is of significant interest. However, current methods rely on hand-crafted features or direct adaptations of model architectures from other domains, which lack feasibility as data scales increase or ignore the rich chemical information inherent in reactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces RAlign, a novel chemical reaction representation learning model for various organic reaction-related tasks. By integrating atomic correspondence between reactants and products, our model discerns the molecular transformations that occur during the reaction, thereby enhancing comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have designed an adapter structure to incorporate reaction conditions into the chemical reaction representation, allowing the model to handle various reaction conditions and to adapt to various datasets and downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce a reaction-center-aware attention mechanism that enables the model to concentrate on key functional groups, thereby generating potent representations for chemical reactions. Our model has been evaluated on a range of downstream tasks. Experimental results indicate that our model markedly outperforms existing chemical reaction representation learning architectures on most of the datasets. We plan to open-source the code contingent upon the acceptance of the paper.

> We introduce EnerVerse, a comprehensive framework for embodied future space generation specifically designed for robotic manipulation tasks. EnerVerse seamlessly integrates convolutional and bidirectional attention mechanisms for inner-chunk space modeling, ensuring low-level consistency and continuity. Recognizing the inherent redundancy in video data, we propose a sparse memory context combined with a chunkwise unidirectional generative paradigm to enable the generation of infinitely long sequences. To further augment robotic capabilities, we introduce the Free Anchor View (FAV) space, which provides flexible perspectives to enhance observation and analysis. The FAV space mitigates motion modeling ambiguity, removes physical constraints in confined environments, and significantly improves the robot's generalization and adaptability across various tasks and settings. To address the prohibitive costs and labor intensity of acquiring multi-camera observations, we present a data engine pipeline that integrates a generative model with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS). This pipeline leverages the generative model's robust generalization capabilities and the spatial constraints provided by 4DGS, enabling an iterative enhancement of data quality and diversity, thus creating a data flywheel effect that effectively narrows the sim-to-real gap. Finally, our experiments demonstrate that the embodied future space generation prior substantially enhances policy predictive capabilities, resulting in improved overall performance, particularly in long-range robotic manipulation tasks.

> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.

> The Transformation-Interaction-Rational is a representation for symbolic regression that limits the search space of functions to the ratio of two nonlinear functions each one defined as the linear regression of transformed variables. This representation has the main objective to bias the search towards simpler expressions while keeping the approximation power of standard approaches.   The performance of using Genetic Programming with this representation was substantially better than with its predecessor (Interaction-Transformation) and ranked close to the state-of-the-art on a contemporary Symbolic Regression benchmark. On a closer look at these results, we observed that the performance could be further improved with an additional selective pressure for smaller expressions when the dataset contains just a few data points. The introduction of a penalization term applied to the fitness measure improved the results on these smaller datasets. One problem with this approach is that it introduces two additional hyperparameters: i) a criteria to when the penalization should be activated and, ii) the amount of penalization to the fitness function.   In this paper, we extend Transformation-Interaction-Rational to support multi-objective optimization, specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, and apply that to the same benchmark. A detailed analysis of the results show that the use of multi-objective optimization benefits the overall performance on a subset of the benchmarks while keeping the results similar to the single-objective approach on the remainder of the datasets. Specifically to the small datasets, we observe a small (and statistically insignificant) improvement of the results suggesting that further strategies must be explored.

- `2501.01908v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01908v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01908v1)

> Deep learning (DL) methods, especially those based on physics-driven DL, have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Our detection strategy is based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency. The output of the model is mapped to another set of MRI measurements for a different sub-sampling pattern, and this synthesized data is reconstructed with the same model. Intuitively, without an attack, the second reconstruction is expected to be consistent with the first, while with an attack, disruptions are present. Subsequently, this idea is extended to devise a novel objective function, which is minimized within a small ball around the attack input for mitigation. Experimental results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining.

> Consistency models have emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion models, offering high-quality generative capabilities through single-step sample generation. However, their application to multi-domain image translation tasks, such as cross-modal translation and low-light image enhancement remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Conditional Consistency Models (CCMs) for multi-domain image translation by incorporating additional conditional inputs. We implement these modifications by introducing task-specific conditional inputs that guide the denoising process, ensuring that the generated outputs retain structural and contextual information from the corresponding input domain. We evaluate CCMs on 10 different datasets demonstrating their effectiveness in producing high-quality translated images across multiple domains. Code is available at https://github.com/amilbhagat/Conditional-Consistency-Models.

> Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning technique that allows multiple entities to jointly train a model while preserving dataset privacy. However, its distributed nature has raised various security concerns, which have been addressed by increasingly sophisticated defenses. These protections utilize a range of data sources and metrics to, for example, filter out malicious model updates, ensuring that the impact of attacks is minimized or eliminated.   This paper explores the feasibility of designing a generic attack method capable of installing backdoors in FL while evading a diverse array of defenses. Specifically, we focus on an attacker strategy called MIGO, which aims to produce model updates that subtly blend with legitimate ones. The resulting effect is a gradual integration of a backdoor into the global model, often ensuring its persistence long after the attack concludes, while generating enough ambiguity to hinder the effectiveness of defenses.   MIGO was employed to implant three types of backdoors across five datasets and different model architectures. The results demonstrate the significant threat posed by these backdoors, as MIGO consistently achieved exceptionally high backdoor accuracy (exceeding 90%) while maintaining the utility of the main task. Moreover, MIGO exhibited strong evasion capabilities against ten defenses, including several state-of-the-art methods. When compared to four other attack strategies, MIGO consistently outperformed them across most configurations. Notably, even in extreme scenarios where the attacker controls just 0.1% of the clients, the results indicate that successful backdoor insertion is possible if the attacker can persist for a sufficient number of rounds.

- *Augustinas Jučas, Chirag Raman*

- `2501.01915v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01915v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01915v1)

> Adaptively forecasting human behavior in social settings is an important step toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Most existing research in social forecasting has focused either on unfocused interactions, such as pedestrian trajectory prediction, or on monadic and dyadic behavior forecasting. In contrast, social psychology emphasizes the importance of group interactions for understanding complex social dynamics. This creates a gap that we address in this paper: forecasting social interactions at the group (conversation) level. Additionally, it is important for a forecasting model to be able to adapt to groups unseen at train time, as even the same individual behaves differently across different groups. This highlights the need for a forecasting model to explicitly account for each group's unique dynamics. To achieve this, we adopt a meta-learning approach to human behavior forecasting, treating every group as a separate meta-learning task. As a result, our method conditions its predictions on the specific behaviors within the group, leading to generalization to unseen groups. Specifically, we introduce Social Process (SP) models, which predict a distribution over future multimodal cues jointly for all group members based on their preceding low-level multimodal cues, while incorporating other past sequences of the same group's interactions. In this work we also analyze the generalization capabilities of SP models in both their outputs and latent spaces through the use of realistic synthetic datasets.

- `2411.07976v6` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07976v6) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07976v6)

> Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitates effective risk assessment strategies, with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring via computed tomography (CT) being a key method for prevention. Traditional methods, primarily based on UNET architectures implemented on pre-built models, face challenges like the scarcity of annotated CT scans containing CAC and imbalanced datasets, leading to reduced performance in segmentation and scoring tasks. In this study, we address these limitations by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels), which trains without requiring CAC-specific annotations, enhancing its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO-LG model, which leverages label guidance to focus on calcified areas, achieves significant improvements, with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 90% for detecting CAC-containing CT slices, compared to the standard DINO model's sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 77%. Additionally, false-negative and false-positive rates are reduced by 49% and 59%, respectively, instilling greater confidence in clinicians when ruling out calcification in low-risk patients and minimizing unnecessary imaging reviews by radiologists. Further, CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are conducted using a basic UNET architecture, applied specifically to CT slices identified by the DINO-LG model as containing calcified areas. This targeted approach enhances CAC scoring accuracy by feeding the UNET model with relevant slices, significantly improving diagnostic precision, reducing both false positives and false negatives, and ultimately lowering overall healthcare costs by minimizing unnecessary tests and treatments, presenting a valuable advancement in CAD risk assessment.

- *Christopher Burger, Charles Walter, Thai Le, Lingwei Chen*

- `2501.02042v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02042v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02042v1)

> Recent work has investigated the concept of adversarial attacks on explainable AI (XAI) in the NLP domain with a focus on examining the vulnerability of local surrogate methods such as Lime to adversarial perturbations or small changes on the input of a machine learning (ML) model. In such attacks, the generated explanation is manipulated while the meaning and structure of the original input remain similar under the ML model. Such attacks are especially alarming when XAI is used as a basis for decision making (e.g., prescribing drugs based on AI medical predictors) or for legal action (e.g., legal dispute involving AI software). Although weaknesses across many XAI methods have been shown to exist, the reasons behind why remain little explored. Central to this XAI manipulation is the similarity measure used to calculate how one explanation differs from another. A poor choice of similarity measure can lead to erroneous conclusions about the stability or adversarial robustness of an XAI method. Therefore, this work investigates a variety of similarity measures designed for text-based ranked lists referenced in related work to determine their comparative suitability for use. We find that many measures are overly sensitive, resulting in erroneous estimates of stability. We then propose a weighting scheme for text-based data that incorporates the synonymity between the features within an explanation, providing more accurate estimates of the actual weakness of XAI methods to adversarial examples.

> The problem of an optimal mapping between Hilbert spaces $IN$ and $OUT$, based on a series of density matrix mapping measurements $\rho^{(l)} \to \varrho^{(l)}$, $l=1\dots M$, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the total fidelity $\mathcal{F}=\sum_{l=1}^{M} \omega^{(l)} F\left(\varrho^{(l)},\sum_s B_s \rho^{(l)} B^{\dagger}_s\right)$ subject to probability preservation constraints on Kraus operators $B_s$. For $F(\varrho,\sigma)$ in the form that total fidelity can be represented as a quadratic form with superoperator $\mathcal{F}=\sum_s\left\langle B_s\middle|S\middle| B_s \right\rangle$ (either exactly or as an approximation) an iterative algorithm is developed. The work introduces two important generalizations of unitary learning: 1. $IN$/$OUT$ states are represented as density matrices. 2. The mapping itself is formulated as a mixed unitary quantum channel $A^{OUT}=\sum_s |w_s|^2 \mathcal{U}_s A^{IN} \mathcal{U}_s^{\dagger}$ (no general quantum channel yet). This marks a crucial advancement from the commonly studied unitary mapping of pure states $\phi_l=\mathcal{U} \psi_l$ to a quantum channel, what allows us to distinguish probabilistic mixture of states and their superposition. An application of the approach is demonstrated on unitary learning of density matrix mapping $\varrho^{(l)}=\mathcal{U} \rho^{(l)} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$, in this case a quadratic on $\mathcal{U}$ fidelity can be constructed by considering $\sqrt{\rho^{(l)}} \to \sqrt{\varrho^{(l)}}$ mapping, and on a quantum channel, where quadratic on $B_s$ fidelity is an approximation -- a quantum channel is then obtained as a hierarchy of unitary mappings, a mixed unitary channel. The approach can be applied to studying quantum inverse problems, variational quantum algorithms, quantum tomography, and more.

> Exploring the functions of genes and gene products is crucial to a wide range of fields, including medical research, evolutionary biology, and environmental science. However, discovering new functions largely relies on expensive and exhaustive wet lab experiments. Existing methods of automatic function annotation or prediction mainly focus on protein function prediction with sequence, 3D-structures or protein family information. In this study, we propose to tackle the gene function prediction problem by exploring Gene Ontology graph and annotation with BERT (GoBERT) to decipher the underlying relationships among gene functions. Our proposed novel function prediction task utilizes existing functions as inputs and generalizes the function prediction to gene and gene products. Specifically, two pre-train tasks are designed to jointly train GoBERT to capture both explicit and implicit relations of functions. Neighborhood prediction is a self-supervised multi-label classification task that captures the explicit function relations. Specified masking and recovering task helps GoBERT in finding implicit patterns among functions. The pre-trained GoBERT possess the ability to predict novel functions for various gene and gene products based on known functional annotations. Extensive experiments, biological case studies, and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GoBERT.

> Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown tremendous promise in addressing data-intensive challenges in recent years. In particular, some attempts have been made to improve predictions of Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models by incorporating human mobility between metapopulations and using graph approaches to estimate corresponding hyperparameters. Recently, researchers have found that a hybrid GCN-SIR approach outperformed existing methodologies when used on the data collected on a precinct level in Japan. In our work, we extend this approach to data collected from the continental US, adjusting for the differing mobility patterns and varying policy responses. We also develop the strategy for real-time continuous estimation of the reproduction number and study the accuracy of model predictions for the overall population as well as individual states. Strengths and limitations of the GCN-SIR approach are discussed as a potential candidate for modeling disease dynamics.

> Most current captioning systems use language models trained on data from specific settings, such as image-based captioning via Amazon Mechanical Turk, limiting their ability to generalize to other modality distributions and contexts. This limitation hinders performance in tasks like audio or video captioning, where different semantic cues are needed. Addressing this challenge is crucial for creating more adaptable and versatile captioning frameworks applicable across diverse real-world contexts. In this work, we introduce a method to adapt captioning networks to the semantics of alternative settings, such as capturing audibility in audio captioning, where it is crucial to describe sounds and their sources. Our framework consists of two main components: (i) a frozen captioning system incorporating a language model (LM), and (ii) a text classifier that guides the captioning system. The classifier is trained on a dataset automatically generated by GPT-4, using tailored prompts specifically designed to enhance key aspects of the generated captions. Importantly, the framework operates solely during inference, eliminating the need for further training of the underlying captioning model. We evaluate the framework on various models and modalities, with a focus on audio captioning, and report promising results. Notably, when combined with an existing zero-shot audio captioning system, our framework improves its quality and sets state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot audio captioning.

> Computational cardiovascular flow modeling plays a crucial role in understanding blood flow dynamics. While 3D models provide acute details, they are computationally expensive, especially with fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. 1D models offer a computationally efficient alternative, by simplifying the 3D Navier-Stokes equations through axisymmetric flow assumption and cross-sectional averaging. However, traditional 1D models based on finite element methods (FEM) often lack accuracy compared to 3D averaged solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-constrained machine learning technique that enhances the accuracy of 1D blood flow models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach, utilizing a physics-constrained coupled neural differential equation (PCNDE) framework, demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional FEM-based 1D models across a wide range of inlet boundary condition waveforms and stenosis blockage ratios. A key innovation lies in the spatial formulation of the momentum conservation equation, departing from the traditional temporal approach and capitalizing on the inherent temporal periodicity of blood flow. This spatial neural differential equation formulation switches space and time and overcomes issues related to coupling stability and smoothness, while simplifying boundary condition implementation. The model accurately captures flow rate, area, and pressure variations for unseen waveforms and geometries. We evaluate the model's robustness to input noise and explore the loss landscapes associated with the inclusion of different physics terms. This advanced 1D modeling technique offers promising potential for rapid cardiovascular simulations, achieving computational efficiency and accuracy. By combining the strengths of physics-based and data-driven modeling, this approach enables fast and accurate cardiovascular simulations.

> Designing re-entry vehicles requires accurate predictions of hypersonic flow around their geometry. Rapid prediction of such flows can revolutionize vehicle design, particularly for morphing geometries. We evaluate advanced neural operator models such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), parameter-conditioned U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and MeshGraphNet, with the objective of addressing the challenge of learning geometry-dependent hypersonic flow fields with limited data. Specifically, we compare the performance of these models for two grid types: uniform Cartesian and irregular grids. To train these models, we use 36 unique elliptic geometries for generating high-fidelity simulations with a high-order entropy-stable DGSEM solver, emphasizing the challenge of working with a scarce dataset. We evaluate and compare the four operator-based models for their efficacy in predicting hypersonic flow field around the elliptic body. Moreover, we develop a novel framework, called Fusion DeepONet, which leverages neural field concepts and generalizes effectively across varying geometries. Despite the scarcity of training data, Fusion DeepONet achieves performance comparable to parameter-conditioned U-Net on uniform grids while it outperforms MeshGraphNet and vanilla DeepONet on irregular, arbitrary grids. Fusion DeepONet requires significantly fewer trainable parameters as compared to U-Net, MeshGraphNet, and FNO, making it computationally efficient. We also analyze the basis functions of the Fusion DeepONet model using Singular Value Decomposition. This analysis reveals that Fusion DeepONet generalizes effectively to unseen solutions and adapts to varying geometries and grid points, demonstrating its robustness in scenarios with limited training data.

> In this paper, we propose to improve end-to-end (E2E) spoken language understand (SLU) in an RNN transducer model (RNN-T) by incorporating a joint self-conditioned CTC automatic speech recognition (ASR) objective. Our proposed model is akin to an E2E differentiable cascaded model which performs ASR and SLU sequentially and we ensure that the SLU task is conditioned on the ASR task by having CTC self conditioning. This novel joint modeling of ASR and SLU improves SLU performance significantly over just using SLU optimization. We further improve the performance by aligning the acoustic embeddings of this model with the semantically richer BERT model. Our proposed knowledge transfer strategy makes use of a bag-of-entity prediction layer on the aligned embeddings and the output of this is used to condition the RNN-T based SLU decoding. These techniques show significant improvement over several strong baselines and can perform at par with large models like Whisper with significantly fewer parameters.

> Transfer learning has emerged as an effective approach to accelerate learning by integrating knowledge from related source agents. However, challenges arise due to data heterogeneity-such as differences in feature sets or incomplete datasets-which often results in the nonidentifiability of causal effects. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in partially observable contextual bandits, where agents operate with incomplete information and limited access to hidden confounders. To address the challenges posed by unobserved confounders, we formulate optimization problems to derive tight bounds on the nonidentifiable causal effects. We then propose an efficient method that discretizes the functional constraints of unknown distributions into linear constraints, allowing us to sample compatible causal models through a sequential process of solving linear programs. This method takes into account estimation errors and exhibits strong convergence properties, ensuring robust and reliable causal bounds. Leveraging these causal bounds, we improve classical bandit algorithms, achieving tighter regret upper and lower bounds relative to the sizes of action sets and function spaces. In tasks involving function approximation, which are crucial for handling complex context spaces, our method significantly improves the dependence on function space size compared to previous work. We formally prove that our causally enhanced algorithms outperform classical bandit algorithms, achieving notably faster convergence rates. The applicability of our approach is further illustrated through an example of offline pricing policy learning with censored demand. Simulations confirm the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to enhance contextual bandit agents in real-world applications, especially when data is scarce, costly, or restricted due to privacy concerns.

> We pretrain METAGENE-1, a 7-billion-parameter autoregressive transformer model, which we refer to as a metagenomic foundation model, on a novel corpus of diverse metagenomic DNA and RNA sequences comprising over 1.5 trillion base pairs. This dataset is sourced from a large collection of human wastewater samples, processed and sequenced using deep metagenomic (next-generation) sequencing methods. Unlike genomic models that focus on individual genomes or curated sets of specific species, the aim of METAGENE-1 is to capture the full distribution of genomic information present within this wastewater, to aid in tasks relevant to pandemic monitoring and pathogen detection. We carry out byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization on our dataset, tailored for metagenomic sequences, and then pretrain our model. In this paper, we first detail the pretraining dataset, tokenization strategy, and model architecture, highlighting the considerations and design choices that enable the effective modeling of metagenomic data. We then show results of pretraining this model on our metagenomic dataset, providing details about our losses, system metrics, and training stability over the course of pretraining. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of METAGENE-1, which achieves state-of-the-art results on a set of genomic benchmarks and new evaluations focused on human-pathogen detection and genomic sequence embedding, showcasing its potential for public health applications in pandemic monitoring, biosurveillance, and early detection of emerging health threats.

> The state-of-the-art for training on-device language models for mobile keyboard applications combines federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP) via the DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) algorithm. Two variants of DP-FTRL are used in practice, tree aggregation and matrix factorization. However, tree aggregation suffers from significantly suboptimal privacy/utility tradeoffs, while matrix mechanisms require expensive optimization parameterized by hard-to-estimate-in-advance constants, and high runtime memory costs.This paper extends the recently introduced Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) mechanism to multi-participation scenarios. Our BLT-DP-FTRL maintains the ease-of-use advantages of tree aggregation, while essentially matching matrix factorization in terms of utility and privacy. We evaluate BLT-DP-FTRL on the StackOverflow dataset, serving as a re-producible simulation benchmark, and across four on-device language model tasks in a production FL system. Our empirical results highlight the advantages of the BLT mechanism and elevate the practicality and effectiveness of DP in real-world scenarios.

> The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.

> The vast diversity of styles, domains, and quality levels present in language model pre-training corpora is essential in developing general model capabilities, but efficiently learning and deploying the correct behaviors exemplified in each of these heterogeneous data sources is challenging. To address this, we propose a new method, termed Metadata Conditioning then Cooldown (MeCo), to incorporate additional learning cues during pre-training. MeCo first provides metadata (e.g., URLs like en.wikipedia.org) alongside the text during training and later uses a cooldown phase with only the standard text, thereby enabling the model to function normally even without metadata. MeCo significantly accelerates pre-training across different model scales (600M to 8B parameters) and training sources (C4, RefinedWeb, and DCLM). For instance, a 1.6B language model trained with MeCo matches the downstream task performance of standard pre-training while using 33% less data. Additionally, MeCo enables us to steer language models by conditioning the inference prompt on either real or fabricated metadata that encodes the desired properties of the output: for example, prepending wikipedia.org to reduce harmful generations or factquizmaster.com (fabricated) to improve common knowledge task performance. We also demonstrate that MeCo is compatible with different types of metadata, such as model-generated topics. MeCo is remarkably simple, adds no computational overhead, and demonstrates promise in producing more capable and steerable language models.

> Although generative models hold promise for discovering molecules with optimized desired properties, they often fail to suggest synthesizable molecules that improve upon the known molecules seen in training. We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.

> Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in text-guided style transfer, primarily attributed to innovations in diffusion models. These models excel in conditional guidance, utilizing text or images to direct the sampling process. However, despite their capabilities, direct conditional guidance approaches often face challenges in balancing the expressiveness of textual semantics with the diversity of output results while capturing stylistic features. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtCrafter, a novel framework for text-to-image style transfer. Specifically, we introduce an attention-based style extraction module, meticulously engineered to capture the subtle stylistic elements within an image. This module features a multi-layer architecture that leverages the capabilities of perceiver attention mechanisms to integrate fine-grained information. Additionally, we present a novel text-image aligning augmentation component that adeptly balances control over both modalities, enabling the model to efficiently map image and text embeddings into a shared feature space. We achieve this through attention operations that enable smooth information flow between modalities. Lastly, we incorporate an explicit modulation that seamlessly blends multimodal enhanced embeddings with original embeddings through an embedding reframing design, empowering the model to generate diverse outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArtCrafter yields impressive results in visual stylization, exhibiting exceptional levels of stylistic intensity, controllability, and diversity.

> Recent work investigates whether LMs learn human-like linguistic generalizations and representations from developmentally plausible amounts of data. Yet, the basic linguistic units processed in these LMs are determined by subword-based tokenization, which limits their validity as models of learning at and below the word level. In this paper, we explore the potential of tokenization-free, phoneme- and grapheme-based language models. We demonstrate that small models based on the Llama architecture can achieve strong linguistic performance on standard syntactic and novel lexical/phonetic benchmarks when trained with character-level vocabularies. We further show that phoneme-based models almost match grapheme-based models in standard tasks and novel evaluations. Our findings suggest a promising direction for creating more linguistically plausible language models that are better suited for computational studies of language acquisition and processing.

> The complexity of modern electro-mechanical systems require the development of sophisticated diagnostic methods like anomaly detection capable of detecting deviations. Conventional anomaly detection approaches like signal processing and statistical modelling often struggle to effectively handle the intricacies of complex systems, particularly when dealing with multi-variate signals. In contrast, neural network-based anomaly detection methods, especially Auto-Encoders, have emerged as a compelling alternative, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, Auto-Encoders exhibit inherent opaqueness in their decision-making processes, hindering their practical implementation at scale. Addressing this opacity is essential for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of anomaly detection models. In this work, we address this challenge by employing a feature selector to select features and counterfactual explanations to give a context to the model output. We tested this approach on the SKAB benchmark dataset and an industrial time-series dataset. The gradient based counterfactual explanation approach was evaluated via validity, sparsity and distance measures. Our experimental findings illustrate that our proposed counterfactual approach can offer meaningful and valuable insights into the model decision-making process, by explaining fewer signals compared to conventional approaches. These insights enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of anomaly detection models.

> Societal stereotypes are at the center of a myriad of responsible AI interventions targeted at reducing the generation and propagation of potentially harmful outcomes. While these efforts are much needed, they tend to be fragmented and often address different parts of the issue without taking in a unified or holistic approach about social stereotypes and how they impact various parts of the machine learning pipeline. As a result, it fails to capitalize on the underlying mechanisms that are common across different types of stereotypes, and to anchor on particular aspects that are relevant in certain cases. In this paper, we draw on social psychological research, and build on NLP data and methods, to propose a unified framework to operationalize stereotypes in generative AI evaluations. Our framework identifies key components of stereotypes that are crucial in AI evaluation, including the target group, associated attribute, relationship characteristics, perceiving group, and relevant context. We also provide considerations and recommendations for its responsible use.

> This study presents an advanced computational framework for the optimal design of thermal insulation components in buildings, utilizing silica aerogel porous materials. The framework aims to achieve superior thermal insulation while maintaining structural integrity of the component under stress concentrations. A multiphase continuum model is employed to simulate the thermomechanical behavior of the insulation system, governed by a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). The design process explicitly accounts for spatially correlated uncertainties in the design parameters, particularly the spatially varying aerogel porosity, resulting in a high-dimensional, PDE-constrained optimization under uncertainty. The optimization problem is formulated using a risk-averse cost functional to balance insulation performance with uncertainty mitigation, incorporating statistical moments of the design objective. Additionally, chance constraints are imposed to limit the probability of stress exceeding critical thresholds. To address the challenges arising from high-dimensional parameters, the optimization leverages a second-order Taylor expansion of both the design objective and the chance constraint functions, combined with a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix for efficient evaluation of the generalized eigenvalue problem. This approach supports scalable computations, either directly or as a variance-reduction control variate for Monte Carlo estimations. Combined with a gradient-based optimization approach, we achieve a scalable solution algorithm with dimension-independent computational costs in terms of number of PDE solved. Two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments on the design of thermal breaks in buildings showcase the features of the proposed design under uncertainty framework with respect to accuracy, scalability, and computational cost.

> Over time, the distribution of medical image data drifts due to multiple factors, including shifts in patient demographics, acquisition devices, and disease manifestation. While human radiologists can extrapolate their knowledge to such changes, AI systems cannot. In fact, deep learning models are highly susceptible to even slight variations in image characteristics. Therefore, manufacturers must update their models with new data to ensure that they remain safe and effective. Until recently, conducting such model updates in the USA and European Union meant applying for re-approval. Given the time and monetary costs associated with these processes, updates were infrequent, and obsolete systems continued functioning for too long. During 2024, several developments in the regulatory frameworks of these regions have taken place that promise to streamline the process of rolling out model updates safely: The European Artificial Intelligence Act came into effect last August, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released the final marketing submission recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan (PCCP) in December. We give an overview of the requirements and objectives of recent regulatory efforts and summarize the building blocks needed for successfully deploying dynamic systems. At the center of these pieces of regulation - and as prerequisites for manufacturers to conduct model updates without re-approval - are the need to describe the data collection and re-training processes and to establish real-world quality monitoring mechanisms.

> With the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs), structured pruning has become a widely used technique to learn efficient, smaller models from larger ones, delivering superior performance compared to training similarly sized models from scratch. In this paper, we move beyond the traditional static pruning approach of determining a fixed pruning mask for a model, and propose a dynamic approach to structured pruning. In our method, the pruning mask is input-dependent and adapts dynamically based on the information described in a user instruction. Our approach, termed "instruction-following pruning", introduces a sparse mask predictor that takes the user instruction as input and dynamically selects the most relevant model parameters for the given task. To identify and activate effective parameters, we jointly optimize the sparse mask predictor and the LLM, leveraging both instruction-following data and the pre-training corpus. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks. For example, our 3B activated model improves over the 3B dense model by 5-8 points of absolute margin on domains such as math and coding, and rivals the performance of a 9B model.

- *Mehrdad Moghimi, Hyejin Ku*

- `2501.02087v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02087v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02087v1)

> In domains such as finance, healthcare, and robotics, managing worst-case scenarios is critical, as failure to do so can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides a natural framework to incorporate risk sensitivity into decision-making processes. However, existing approaches face two key limitations: (1) the use of fixed risk measures at each decision step often results in overly conservative policies, and (2) the interpretation and theoretical properties of the learned policies remain unclear. While optimizing a static risk measure addresses these issues, its use in the DRL framework has been limited to the simple static CVaR risk measure. In this paper, we present a novel DRL algorithm with convergence guarantees that optimizes for a broader class of static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM). Additionally, we provide a clear interpretation of the learned policy by leveraging the distribution of returns in DRL and the decomposition of static coherent risk measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model learns policies aligned with the SRM objective, and outperforms existing risk-neutral and risk-sensitive DRL models in various settings.

> Background. As artificial intelligence and AI-powered systems continue to grow, the role of data scientists has become essential in software development environments. Data scientists face challenges related to managing large volumes of data and addressing the societal impacts of AI algorithms, which require a broad range of soft skills.   Goal. This study aims to identify the key soft skills that data scientists need when working on AI-powered projects, with a particular focus on addressing biases that affect society.   Method. We conducted a thematic analysis of 87 job postings on LinkedIn and 11 interviews with industry practitioners. The job postings came from companies in 12 countries and covered various experience levels. The interviews featured professionals from diverse backgrounds, including different genders, ethnicities, and sexual orientations, who worked with clients from South America, North America, and Europe.   Results. While data scientists share many skills with other software practitioners -- such as those related to coordination, engineering, and management -- there is a growing emphasis on innovation and social responsibility. These include soft skills like curiosity, critical thinking, empathy, and ethical awareness, which are essential for addressing the ethical and societal implications of AI.   Conclusion. Our findings indicate that data scientists working on AI-powered projects require not only technical expertise but also a solid foundation in soft skills that enable them to build AI systems responsibly, with fairness and inclusivity. These insights have important implications for recruitment and training within software companies and for ensuring the long-term success of AI-powered systems and their broader societal impact.

> This article reviews the recent advances on the statistical foundation of reinforcement learning (RL) in the offline and low-adaptive settings. We will start by arguing why offline RL is the appropriate model for almost any real-life ML problems, even if they have nothing to do with the recent AI breakthroughs that use RL. Then we will zoom into two fundamental problems of offline RL: offline policy evaluation (OPE) and offline policy learning (OPL). It may be surprising to people that tight bounds for these problems were not known even for tabular and linear cases until recently. We delineate the differences between worst-case minimax bounds and instance-dependent bounds. We also cover key algorithmic ideas and proof techniques behind near-optimal instance-dependent methods in OPE and OPL. Finally, we discuss the limitations of offline RL and review a burgeoning problem of \emph{low-adaptive exploration} which addresses these limitations by providing a sweet middle ground between offline and online RL.

> Creativity relates to the ability to generate novel and effective ideas in the areas of interest. How are such creative ideas generated? One possible mechanism that supports creative ideation and is gaining increased empirical attention is by asking questions. Question asking is a likely cognitive mechanism that allows defining problems, facilitating creative problem solving. However, much is unknown about the exact role of questions in creativity. This work presents an attempt to apply text mining methods to measure the cognitive potential of questions, taking into account, among others, (a) question type, (b) question complexity, and (c) the content of the answer. This contribution summarizes the history of question mining as a part of creativity research, along with the natural language processing methods deemed useful or helpful in the study. In addition, a novel approach is proposed, implemented, and applied to five datasets. The experimental results obtained are comprehensively analyzed, suggesting that natural language processing has a role to play in creative research.

> Online tracking is a widespread practice on the web with questionable ethics, security, and privacy concerns. While web tracking can offer personalized and curated content to Internet users, it operates as a sophisticated surveillance mechanism to gather extensive user information. This paper introduces PriveShield, a light-weight privacy mechanism that disrupts the information gathering cycle while offering more control to Internet users to maintain their privacy. PriveShield is implemented as a browser extension that offers an adjustable privacy feature to surf the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously without any changes to underlying browser code or services. When necessary, multiple factors are automatically analyzed on the client side to isolate cookies and other information that are the basis of online tracking. PriveShield creates isolated profiles for clients based on their browsing history, interactions with websites, and the amount of time they spend on specific websites. This allows the users to easily prevent unwanted browsing information from being shared with third parties and ad exchanges without the need for manual configuration. Our evaluation results from 54 real-world scenarios show that our extension is effective in preventing retargeted ads in 91% of those scenarios.

> The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to increase and evolve, including in software engineering (SE). This integration involves processes traditionally entrusted to humans, such as coding. However, the impact on socio-technical processes like code review remains underexplored. In this interview-based study (20 interviewees), we investigate how software engineers perceive and engage with Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted code reviews compared to human peer-led reviews. In this inherently human-centric process, we aim to understand how software engineers navigate the introduction of AI into collaborative workflows. We found that engagement in code review is multi-dimensional, spanning cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. The introduction of LLM-assisted review impacts some of these attributes. For example, there is less need for emotional regulation and coping mechanisms when dealing with an LLM compared to peers. However, the cognitive load sometimes is higher in dealing with LLM-generated feedback due to its excessive details. Software engineers use a similar sense-making process to evaluate and adopt feedback suggestions from their peers and the LLM. However, the LLM feedback adoption is constrained by trust and lack of context in the review. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how AI tools are impacting SE socio-technical processes and provide insights into the future of AI-human collaboration in SE practices.

> In this paper, we conduct a data-scientific investigation of Maass forms. We find that averaging the Fourier coefficients of Maass forms with the same Fricke sign reveals patterns analogous to the recently discovered "murmuration" phenomenon, and that these patterns become more pronounced when parity is incorporated as an additional feature. Approximately 43% of the forms in our dataset have an unknown Fricke sign. For the remaining forms, we employ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to machine learn their Fricke sign, achieving 96% (resp. 94%) accuracy for forms with even (resp. odd) parity. We apply the trained LDA model to forms with unknown Fricke signs to make predictions. The average values based on the predicted Fricke signs are computed and compared to those for forms with known signs to verify the reasonableness of the predictions. Additionally, a subset of these predictions is evaluated against heuristic guesses provided by Hejhal's algorithm, showing a match approximately 95% of the time. We also use neural networks to obtain results comparable to those from the LDA model.

> Compact symbolic expressions have been shown to be more efficient than neural network models in terms of resource consumption and inference speed when implemented on custom hardware such as FPGAs, while maintaining comparable accuracy~\cite{tsoi2023symbolic}. These capabilities are highly valuable in environments with stringent computational resource constraints, such as high-energy physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. However, finding compact expressions for high-dimensional datasets remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of genetic programming, the search algorithm of most symbolic regression methods. Contrary to genetic programming, the neural network approach to symbolic regression offers scalability to high-dimensional inputs and leverages gradient methods for faster equation searching. Common ways of constraining expression complexity often involve multistage pruning with fine-tuning, which can result in significant performance loss. In this work, we propose $\tt{SymbolNet}$, a neural network approach to symbolic regression specifically designed as a model compression technique, aimed at enabling low-latency inference for high-dimensional inputs on custom hardware such as FPGAs. This framework allows dynamic pruning of model weights, input features, and mathematical operators in a single training process, where both training loss and expression complexity are optimized simultaneously. We introduce a sparsity regularization term for each pruning type, which can adaptively adjust its strength, leading to convergence at a target sparsity ratio. Unlike most existing symbolic regression methods that struggle with datasets containing more than $\mathcal{O}(10)$ inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the LHC jet tagging task (16 inputs), MNIST (784 inputs), and SVHN (3072 inputs).

> Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are vital infrastructures, and contamination poses serious public health risks. Harmful substances can interact with disinfectants like chlorine, making chlorine monitoring essential for detecting contaminants. However, chlorine sensors often become unreliable and require frequent calibration. This study introduces the Dual-Threshold Anomaly and Drift Detection (AD&DD) method, an unsupervised approach combining a dual-threshold drift detection mechanism with an LSTM-based Variational Autoencoder(LSTM-VAE) for real-time contamination detection. Tested on two realistic WDNs, AD&DD effectively identifies anomalies with sensor offsets as concept drift, and outperforms other methods. A proposed decentralized architecture enables accurate contamination detection and localization by deploying AD&DD on selected nodes.

> For the past 30 years or so, machine learning has stimulated a great deal of research in the study of approximation capabilities (expressive power) of a multitude of processes, such as approximation by shallow or deep neural networks, radial basis function networks, and a variety of kernel based methods. Motivated by applications such as invariant learning, transfer learning, and synthetic aperture radar imaging, we initiate in this paper a general approach to study the approximation capabilities of kernel based networks using non-symmetric kernels. While singular value decomposition is a natural instinct to study such kernels, we consider a more general approach to include the use of a family of kernels, such as generalized translation networks (which include neural networks and translation invariant kernels as special cases) and rotated zonal function kernels. Naturally, unlike traditional kernel based approximation, we cannot require the kernels to be positive definite. In particular, we obtain estimates on the accuracy of uniform approximation of functions in a Sobolev class by ReLU$^r$ networks when $r$ is not necessarily an integer. Our general results apply to the approximation of functions with small smoothness compared to the dimension of the input space.

> Health outcomes depend on complex environmental and sociodemographic factors whose effects change over location and time. Only recently has fine-grained spatial and temporal data become available to study these effects, namely the MEDSAT dataset of English health, environmental, and sociodemographic information. Leveraging this new resource, we use a variety of variable importance techniques to robustly identify the most informative predictors across multiple health outcomes. We then develop an interpretable machine learning framework based on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) to analyze both local and global spatial dependencies of each variable on various health outcomes. Our findings identify NO2 as a global predictor for asthma, hypertension, and anxiety, alongside other outcome-specific predictors related to occupation, marriage, and vegetation. Regional analyses reveal local variations with air pollution and solar radiation, with notable shifts during COVID. This comprehensive approach provides actionable insights for addressing health disparities, and advocates for the integration of interpretable machine learning in public health.

> Data augmentation is arguably the most important regularization technique commonly used to improve generalization performance of machine learning models. It primarily involves the application of appropriate data transformation operations to create new data samples with desired properties. Despite its effectiveness, the process is often challenging because of the time-consuming trial and error procedures for creating and testing different candidate augmentations and their hyperparameters manually. Automated data augmentation methods aim to automate the process. State-of-the-art approaches typically rely on automated machine learning (AutoML) principles. This work presents a comprehensive survey of AutoML-based data augmentation techniques. We discuss various approaches for accomplishing data augmentation with AutoML, including data manipulation, data integration and data synthesis techniques. We present extensive discussion of techniques for realizing each of the major subtasks of the data augmentation process: search space design, hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation. Finally, we carried out an extensive comparison and analysis of the performance of automated data augmentation techniques and state-of-the-art methods based on classical augmentation approaches. The results show that AutoML methods for data augmentation currently outperform state-of-the-art techniques based on conventional approaches.

> Street cats in urban areas often rely on human intervention for survival, leading to challenges in population control and welfare management. In April 2023, Hello Inc., a Chinese urban mobility company, launched the Hello Street Cat initiative to address these issues. The project deployed over 21,000 smart feeding stations across 14 cities in China, integrating livestreaming cameras and treat dispensers activated through user donations. It also promotes the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) method, supported by a community-driven platform, HelloStreetCatWiki, where volunteers catalog and identify cats. However, manual identification is inefficient and unsustainable, creating a need for automated solutions. This study explores Deep Learning-based models for re-identifying street cats in the Hello Street Cat initiative. A dataset of 2,796 images of 69 cats was used to train Siamese Networks with EfficientNetB0, MobileNet and VGG16 as base models, evaluated under contrastive and triplet loss functions. VGG16 paired with contrastive loss emerged as the most effective configuration, achieving up to 97% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.9344 during testing. The approach leverages image augmentation and dataset refinement to overcome challenges posed by limited data and diverse visual variations. These findings underscore the potential of automated cat re-identification to streamline population monitoring and welfare efforts. By reducing reliance on manual processes, the method offers a scalable and reliable solution for communitydriven initiatives. Future research will focus on expanding datasets and developing real-time implementations to enhance practicality in large-scale deployments.

> In recent years, there has been a significant interest in developing machine learning algorithms on embedded systems. This is particularly relevant for bare metal devices in Internet of Things, Robotics, and Industrial applications that face limited memory, processing power, and storage, and which require extreme robustness. To address these constraints, we present MicroFlow, an open-source TinyML framework for the deployment of Neural Networks (NNs) on embedded systems using the Rust programming language. The compiler-based inference engine of MicroFlow, coupled with Rust's memory safety, makes it suitable for TinyML applications in critical environments. The proposed framework enables the successful deployment of NNs on highly resource-constrained devices, including bare-metal 8-bit microcontrollers with only 2kB of RAM. Furthermore, MicroFlow is able to use less Flash and RAM memory than other state-of-the-art solutions for deploying NN reference models (i.e. wake-word and person detection), achieving equally accurate but faster inference compared to existing engines on medium-size NNs, and similar performance on bigger ones. The experimental results prove the efficiency and suitability of MicroFlow for the deployment of TinyML models in critical environments where resources are particularly limited.

> Quantum annealing has garnered significant attention as meta-heuristics inspired by quantum physics for combinatorial optimization problems. Among its many applications, nonnegative/binary matrix factorization stands out for its complexity and relevance in unsupervised machine learning. The use of reverse annealing, a derivative procedure of quantum annealing to prioritize the search in a vicinity under a given initial state, helps improve its optimization performance in matrix factorization. This study proposes an improved strategy that integrates reverse annealing with a linear programming relaxation technique. Using relaxed solutions as the initial configuration for reverse annealing, we demonstrate improvements in optimization performance comparable to the exact optimization methods. Our experiments on facial image datasets show that our method provides better convergence than known reverse annealing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of relaxation-based initialization methods on randomized datasets, demonstrating a relationship between the relaxed solution and the optimal solution. This research underscores the potential of combining reverse annealing and classical optimization strategies to enhance optimization performance.

> Recently, there has been a surge of interest in incorporating neural networks into particle filters, e.g. differentiable particle filters, to perform joint sequential state estimation and model learning for non-linear non-Gaussian state-space models in complex environments. Existing differentiable particle filters are mostly constructed with vanilla neural networks that do not allow density estimation. As a result, they are either restricted to a bootstrap particle filtering framework or employ predefined distribution families (e.g. Gaussian distributions), limiting their performance in more complex real-world scenarios. In this paper we present a differentiable particle filtering framework that uses (conditional) normalizing flows to build its dynamic model, proposal distribution, and measurement model. This not only enables valid probability densities but also allows the proposed method to adaptively learn these modules in a flexible way, without being restricted to predefined distribution families. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed filters and evaluate the proposed normalizing flow-based differentiable particle filters' performance through a series of numerical experiments.

> Modern cyberattacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS) rapidly evolve and cannot be deterred effectively with most current methods which focused on characterizing past threats. Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data processing and model adaptation. AAD has been researched in the literature extensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field. We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management, and algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the art and provide recommendations for future research directions.

> The convergence of humans and artificial intelligence systems introduces new dynamics into the cultural and intellectual landscape. Complementing emerging cultural evolution concepts such as machine culture, AI agents represent a significant technosociological development, particularly within the anthropological study of Web3 as a community focused on decentralization through blockchain. Despite their growing presence, the cultural significance of AI agents remains largely unexplored in academic literature. We argue that, within the context of Web3, these agents challenge traditional notions of participation and influence in public discourse, creating a hybrid marketplace of ideas, a conceptual space where human and AI generated ideas coexist and compete for attention. We examine the current state of AI agents in idea generation, propagation, and engagement, positioning their role as cultural agents through the lens of memetics and encouraging further inquiry into their cultural and societal impact. Additionally, we address the implications of this paradigm for privacy, intellectual property, and governance, highlighting the societal and legal challenges of integrating AI agents into the hybrid marketplace of ideas.

> We describe the implementation of the masking Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) support in GCC 14, a powerful structural coverage metric with wide industry adoption for safety critical applications. By analyzing the structure of Boolean expressions with Binary Decision Diagrams we can observe the key property of MC/DC, the power to independently affect the outcome, and map to the edges of the Control Flow Graph. This mapping can be translated to a few bitwise instructions and enables GCC to instrument programs to efficiently observe and record when conditions have been taken and have an independent effect on the outcome of a decision. By analyzing the BDD rather than the program syntax, GCC can measure MC/DC for almost all of its languages with a single language-agnostic implementation, including support for C, C++, D, and Rust.

> The advent of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for a new era of programming tools with both significant capabilities and risks, as the generated code lacks guarantees of correctness and reliability. Developers using LLMs currently face the difficult task of optimizing, integrating, and maintaining code generated by AI. We propose an embedded domain-specific language (DSL), Pythoness, to address those challenges. In Pythoness, developers program with LLMs at a higher level of abstraction. Rather than interacting directly with generated code, developers using Pythoness operate at the level of behavioral specifications when writing functions, classes, or an entire program. These specifications can take the form of unit tests and property-based tests, which may be expressed formally or in natural language. Guided by these specifications, Pythoness generates code that both passes the tests and can be continuously checked during execution. We posit that the Pythoness approach lets developers harness the full potential of LLMs for code generation while substantially mitigating their inherent risks. We describe our current prototype implementation of Pythoness and demonstrate that it can successfully leverage a combination of tests and code generation to yield higher quality code than specifications alone.

> We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods in possibly nonstationary environments. Many existing RL algorithms in the literature rely on the stationarity assumption that requires the system transition and the reward function to be constant over time. However, the stationarity assumption is restrictive in practice and is likely to be violated in a number of applications, including traffic signal control, robotics and mobile health. In this paper, we develop a consistent procedure to test the nonstationarity of the optimal Q-function based on pre-collected historical data, without additional online data collection. Based on the proposed test, we further develop a sequential change point detection method that can be naturally coupled with existing state-of-the-art RL methods for policy optimization in nonstationary environments. The usefulness of our method is illustrated by theoretical results, simulation studies, and a real data example from the 2018 Intern Health Study. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/limengbinggz/CUSUM-RL.

> Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain. In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.

- `2409.15631v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15631v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15631v3)

> Learning performance data describe correct and incorrect answers or problem-solving attempts in adaptive learning, such as in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Learning performance data tend to be highly sparse (80\%\(\sim\)90\% missing observations) in most real-world applications due to adaptive item selection. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict future performance explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learner data to address data sparsity in learning performance data. First, learning performance is represented as a three-dimensional tensor of learners' questions, answers, and attempts, capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, a module for generating patterns of learning is used. This study contrasts two forms of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generate Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) to generate data associated with different clusters of learner data. We tested this approach on an adult literacy dataset from AutoTutor lessons developed for Adult Reading Comprehension (ARC). We found that: (1) tensor factorization improved the performance in tracing and predicting knowledge mastery compared with other knowledge tracing techniques without data augmentation, showing higher relative fidelity for this imputation method, and (2) the GAN-based simulation showed greater overall stability and less statistical bias based on a divergence evaluation with varying simulation sample sizes compared to GPT.

> Safety-critical driving data is crucial for developing safe and trustworthy self-driving algorithms. Due to the scarcity of safety-critical data in naturalistic datasets, current approaches primarily utilize simulated or artificially generated images. However, there remains a gap in authenticity between these generated images and naturalistic ones. We propose a novel framework to augment the safety-critical driving data from the naturalistic dataset to address this issue. In this framework, we first detect vehicles using YOLOv5, followed by depth estimation and 3D transformation to simulate vehicle proximity and critical driving scenarios better. This allows for targeted modification of vehicle dynamics data to reflect potentially hazardous situations. Compared to the simulated or artificially generated data, our augmentation methods can generate safety-critical driving data with minimal compromise on image authenticity. Experiments using KITTI datasets demonstrate that a downstream self-driving algorithm trained on this augmented dataset performs superiorly compared to the baselines, which include SMOGN and importance sampling.

> Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against three generative models: a variational autoencoder, a large language model, and a diffusion model. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although many of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability rate. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery.

> Cross-modality translation between MRI and PET imaging is challenging due to the distinct mechanisms underlying these modalities. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) are revolutionizing Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection by identifying patients and quantifying brain amyloid levels. However, the potential of BBBMs to enhance PET image synthesis remains unexplored. In this paper, we performed a thorough study on the effect of incorporating BBBM into deep generative models. By evaluating three widely used cross-modality translation models, we found that BBBMs integration consistently enhances the generative quality across all models. By visual inspection of the generated results, we observed that PET images generated by CycleGAN exhibit the best visual fidelity. Based on these findings, we propose Plasma-CycleGAN, a novel generative model based on CycleGAN, to synthesize PET images from MRI using BBBMs as conditions. This is the first approach to integrate BBBMs in conditional cross-modality translation between MRI and PET.

> Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental robotic manipulation tasks and has been the subject of extensive research. However, swiftly teaching a robot to grasp a novel target object in clutter remains challenging. This paper attempts to address the challenge by leveraging object attributes that facilitate recognition, grasping, and rapid adaptation to new domains. In this work, we present an end-to-end encoder-decoder network to learn attribute-based robotic grasping with data-efficient adaptation capability. We first pre-train the end-to-end model with a variety of basic objects to learn generic attribute representation for recognition and grasping. Our approach fuses the embeddings of a workspace image and a query text using a gated-attention mechanism and learns to predict instance grasping affordances. To train the joint embedding space of visual and textual attributes, the robot utilizes object persistence before and after grasping. Our model is self-supervised in a simulation that only uses basic objects of various colors and shapes but generalizes to novel objects in new environments. To further facilitate generalization, we propose two adaptation methods, adversarial adaption and one-grasp adaptation. Adversarial adaptation regulates the image encoder using augmented data of unlabeled images, whereas one-grasp adaptation updates the overall end-to-end model using augmented data from one grasp trial. Both adaptation methods are data-efficient and considerably improve instance grasping performance. Experimental results in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that our approach achieves over 81% instance grasping success rate on unknown objects, which outperforms several baselines by large margins.

> Large language models' reasoning abilities benefit from methods that organize their thought processes, such as chain-of-thought prompting, which employs a sequential structure to guide the reasoning process step-by-step. However, existing approaches focus primarily on organizing the sequence of thoughts, leaving structure in individual thought steps underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Table as Thought, a framework inspired by cognitive neuroscience theories on human thought. Table as Thought organizes reasoning within a tabular schema, where rows represent sequential thought steps and columns capture critical constraints and contextual information to enhance reasoning. The reasoning process iteratively populates the table until self-verification ensures completeness and correctness. Our experiments show that Table as Thought excels in planning tasks and demonstrates a strong potential for enhancing LLM performance in mathematical reasoning compared to unstructured thought baselines. This work provides a novel exploration of refining thought representation within LLMs, paving the way for advancements in reasoning and AI cognition.

- `2405.14303v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14303v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14303v2)

> Graph Neural Networks have achieved remarkable accuracy in semi-supervised node classification tasks. However, these results lack reliable uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction methods provide a theoretical guarantee for node classification tasks, ensuring that the conformal prediction set contains the ground-truth label with a desired probability (e.g., 95%). In this paper, we empirically show that for each node, aggregating the non-conformity scores of nodes with the same label can improve the efficiency of conformal prediction sets while maintaining valid marginal coverage. This observation motivates us to propose a novel algorithm named Similarity-Navigated Adaptive Prediction Sets (SNAPS), which aggregates the non-conformity scores based on feature similarity and structural neighborhood. The key idea behind SNAPS is that nodes with high feature similarity or direct connections tend to have the same label. By incorporating adaptive similar nodes information, SNAPS can generate compact prediction sets and increase the singleton hit ratio (correct prediction sets of size one). Moreover, we theoretically provide a finite-sample coverage guarantee of SNAPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SNAPS, improving the efficiency of prediction sets and singleton hit ratio while maintaining valid coverage.

> As large language models (LLMs) evolve, their ability to deliver personalized and context-aware responses offers transformative potential for improving user experiences. Existing personalization approaches, however, often rely solely on user history to augment the prompt, limiting their effectiveness in generating tailored outputs, especially in cold-start scenarios with sparse data. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PGraphRAG), a framework that leverages user-centric knowledge graphs to enrich personalization. By directly integrating structured user knowledge into the retrieval process and augmenting prompts with user-relevant context, PGraphRAG enhances contextual understanding and output quality. We also introduce the Personalized Graph-based Benchmark for Text Generation, designed to evaluate personalized text generation tasks in real-world settings where user history is sparse or unavailable. Experimental results show that PGraphRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalization methods across diverse tasks, demonstrating the unique advantages of graph-based retrieval for personalization.

> Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical approach for aligning large language models with human preferences, witnessing rapid algorithmic evolution through methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We present REINFORCE++, an enhanced variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm that incorporates key optimization techniques from PPO while eliminating the need for a critic network. REINFORCE++ achieves three primary objectives: (1) simplicity (2) enhanced training stability, and (3) reduced computational overhead. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that REINFORCE++ exhibits superior stability compared to GRPO and achieves greater computational efficiency than PPO while maintaining comparable performance. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF}.

> Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit with fairness constraints is a framework where multiple arms form a super arm and can be pulled in each round under uncertainty to maximize cumulative rewards while ensuring the minimum average reward required by each arm. The existing pessimistic-optimistic algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness violations) and Upper Confidence Bound estimates as a weight for each arm and selects a super arm with the maximum total weight. The number of super arms could be exponential to the number of arms in many scenarios. In wireless networks, interference constraints can cause the number of super arms to grow exponentially with the number of arms. Evaluating all the feasible super arms to find the one with the maximum total weight can incur extremely high computational complexity in the pessimistic-optimistic algorithm. To avoid this, we develop a low-complexity fair learning algorithm based on the so-called pick-and-compare approach that involves randomly picking $M$ feasible super arms to evaluate. By setting $M$ to a constant, the number of comparison steps in the pessimistic-optimistic algorithm can be reduced to a constant, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity. Our theoretical proof shows this low-complexity design incurs only a slight sacrifice in fairness and regret performance. Finally, we validate the theoretical result by extensive simulations.

> In this work, beyond width and depth, we augment a neural network with a new dimension called height by intra-linking neurons in the same layer to create an intra-layer hierarchy, which gives rise to the notion of height. We call a neural network characterized by width, depth, and height a 3D network. To put a 3D network in perspective, we theoretically and empirically investigate the expressivity of height. We show via bound estimation and explicit construction that given the same number of neurons and parameters, a 3D ReLU network of width $W$, depth $K$, and height $H$ has greater expressive power than a 2D network of width $H\times W$ and depth $K$, \textit{i.e.}, $\mathcal{O}((2^H-1)W)^K)$ vs $\mathcal{O}((HW)^K)$, in terms of generating more pieces in a piecewise linear function. Next, through approximation rate analysis, we show that by introducing intra-layer links into networks, a ReLU network of width $\mathcal{O}(W)$ and depth $\mathcal{O}(K)$ can approximate polynomials in $[0,1]^d$ with error $\mathcal{O}\left(2^{-2WK}\right)$, which improves $\mathcal{O}\left(W^{-K}\right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(2^{-K}\right)$ for fixed width networks. Lastly, numerical experiments on 5 synthetic datasets, 15 tabular datasets, and 3 image benchmarks verify that 3D networks can deliver competitive regression and classification performance.

> Emergence in machine learning refers to the spontaneous appearance of complex behaviors or capabilities that arise from the scale and structure of training data and model architectures, despite not being explicitly programmed. We introduce a novel yet straightforward neural network initialization scheme that aims at achieving greater potential for emergence. Measuring emergence as a kind of structural nonlinearity, our method adjusts the layer-wise weight scaling factors to achieve higher emergence values. This enhancement is easy to implement, requiring no additional optimization steps for initialization compared to GradInit. We evaluate our approach across various architectures, including MLP and convolutional architectures for image recognition and transformers for machine translation. We demonstrate substantial improvements in both model accuracy and training speed, with and without batch normalization. The simplicity, theoretical innovation, and demonstrable empirical advantages of our method make it a potent enhancement to neural network initialization practices. These results suggest a promising direction for leveraging emergence to improve neural network training methodologies. Code is available at: https://github.com/johnnyjingzeli/EmergenceInit.

> Fluid simulation is an important research topic in computer graphics (CG) and animation in video games. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for efficient and robust fluid simulation in complex environments. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. We conducted comprehensive experiments on datasets. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.

> Verisign reported a 125 percent increase in data breaches within the healthcare sector in the United States during 2022, with 18.2 million patient records being impacted. Growing healthcare data volumes and diversification mean that medical information is becoming more valuable. Many Health Centers use various technologies to ease the classification, storage, and exchange of big data. This use can also make the health data of the users at risk and vulnerable. AI and blockchain are among the leading technologies at hand. With AI, data-driven operations and big data efficiency have been improved with respect to traditional techniques. Due to its potential to bring about improvements in health services and lower medical costs, this AI technology is regularly used in healthcare. Blockchain helps protect transactions on sharing information and private privacy as long as the exchange of knowledge is that of the standard. The objective of this analysis is to investigate the research and unique contributions since 2008 regarding blockchain-integrated AI and healthcare systems. The work sheds light on applied AI-based healthcare schemes with machine, ballistic, and acrylic learning and disparate blockchain structures. The use of technology in order to ensure patient data security and manage medical information effectively in healthcare settings offers a highly successful position for both healthcare providers and patients. From 2018 to 2021, the best year was 2021 to grow, enhancing everything to examine the download of the device and the counting of Google Academies, for which the joining perspective was borrowed; local research experts were asked, identified articles in recent years, and read reviews of large research grants.

> Developers are sharing pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) models through a variety of model sharing platforms, such as Hugging Face, in an effort to make ML development more collaborative. To share the models, they must first be serialized. While there are many methods of serialization in Python, most of them are unsafe. To tame this insecurity, Hugging Face released safetensors as a way to mitigate the threats posed by unsafe serialization formats. In this context, this paper investigates developer's shifts towards using safetensors on Hugging Face in an effort to understand security practices in the ML development community, as well as how developers react to new methods of serialization. Our results find that more developers are adopting safetensors, and many safetensor adoptions were made by automated conversions of existing models by Hugging Face's conversion tool. We also found, however, that a majority of developers ignore the conversion tool's pull requests, and that while many developers are facing issues with using safetensors, they are eager to learn about and adapt the format.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable empirical success in processing and representing graph-structured data across various domains. However, a significant challenge known as "oversmoothing" persists, where vertex features become nearly indistinguishable in deep GNNs, severely restricting their expressive power and practical utility. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic oversmoothing rates of deep GNNs with and without residual connections by deriving explicit convergence rates for a normalized vertex similarity measure. Our analytical framework is grounded in the multiplicative ergodic theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding residual connections effectively mitigates or prevents oversmoothing across several broad families of parameter distributions. The theoretical findings are strongly supported by numerical experiments.

> Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms face the challenge of efficient exploration due to the exponential increase in the size of the joint state-action space. While demonstration-guided learning has proven beneficial in single-agent settings, its direct applicability to MARL is hindered by the practical difficulty of obtaining joint expert demonstrations. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of personalized expert demonstrations, tailored for each individual agent or, more broadly, each individual type of agent within a heterogeneous team. These demonstrations solely pertain to single-agent behaviors and how each agent can achieve personal goals without encompassing any cooperative elements, thus naively imitating them will not achieve cooperation due to potential conflicts. To this end, we propose an approach that selectively utilizes personalized expert demonstrations as guidance and allows agents to learn to cooperate, namely personalized expert-guided MARL (PegMARL). This algorithm utilizes two discriminators: the first provides incentives based on the alignment of individual agent behavior with demonstrations, and the second regulates incentives based on whether the behaviors lead to the desired outcome. We evaluate PegMARL using personalized demonstrations in both discrete and continuous environments. The experimental results demonstrate that PegMARL outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in solving coordinated tasks, achieving strong performance even when provided with suboptimal personalized demonstrations. We also showcase PegMARL's capability of leveraging joint demonstrations in the StarCraft scenario and converging effectively even with demonstrations from non-co-trained policies.

> The remarkable capabilities and intricate nature of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have dramatically escalated the imperative for specialized AI accelerators. Nonetheless, designing these accelerators for various AI workloads remains both labor- and time-intensive. While existing design exploration and automation tools can partially alleviate the need for extensive human involvement, they still demand substantial hardware expertise, posing a barrier to non-experts and stifling AI accelerator development. Motivated by the astonishing potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating high-quality content in response to human language instructions, we embark on this work to examine the possibility of harnessing LLMs to automate AI accelerator design. Through this endeavor, we develop GPT4AIGChip, a framework intended to democratize AI accelerator design by leveraging human natural languages instead of domain-specific languages. Specifically, we first perform an in-depth investigation into LLMs' limitations and capabilities for AI accelerator design, thus aiding our understanding of our current position and garnering insights into LLM-powered automated AI accelerator design. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the above insights, we develop a framework called GPT4AIGChip, which features an automated demo-augmented prompt-generation pipeline utilizing in-context learning to guide LLMs towards creating high-quality AI accelerator design. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate an effective pipeline for LLM-powered automated AI accelerator generation. Accordingly, we anticipate that our insights and framework can serve as a catalyst for innovations in next-generation LLM-powered design automation tools.

> The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems for predicting Click-Through Rates (CTR) necessitates a delicate balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. This paper presents an optimization framework that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an innovative multi-head early exit architecture to concurrently enhance both aspects. By integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as efficient retrieval mechanisms, we are able to significantly reduce data retrieval times while maintaining high model performance. The early exit strategy employed allows for dynamic termination of model inference, utilizing real-time predictive confidence assessments across multiple heads. This not only quickens the responsiveness of LLMs but also upholds or improves their accuracy, making it ideal for real-time application scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate how this architecture effectively decreases computation time without sacrificing the accuracy needed for reliable recommendation delivery, establishing a new standard for efficient, real-time LLM deployment in commercial systems.

> Transfer learning leverages feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs) pretrained on source tasks with rich data to empower effective finetuning on downstream tasks. However, the pretrained models are often prohibitively large for delivering generalizable representations, which limits their deployment on edge devices with constrained resources. To close this gap, we propose a new transfer learning pipeline, which leverages our finding that robust tickets can transfer better, i.e., subnetworks drawn with properly induced adversarial robustness can win better transferability over vanilla lottery ticket subnetworks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that our proposed transfer learning pipeline can achieve enhanced accuracy-sparsity trade-offs across both diverse downstream tasks and sparsity patterns, further enriching the lottery ticket hypothesis.

> The neural process (NP) is a family of computationally efficient models for learning distributions over functions. However, it suffers from under-fitting and shows suboptimal performance in practice. Researchers have primarily focused on incorporating diverse structural inductive biases, \textit{e.g.} attention or convolution, in modeling. The topic of inference suboptimality and an analysis of the NP from the optimization objective perspective has hardly been studied in earlier work. To fix this issue, we propose a surrogate objective of the target log-likelihood of the meta dataset within the expectation maximization framework. The resulting model, referred to as the Self-normalized Importance weighted Neural Process (SI-NP), can learn a more accurate functional prior and has an improvement guarantee concerning the target log-likelihood. Experimental results show the competitive performance of SI-NP over other NPs objectives and illustrate that structural inductive biases, such as attention modules, can also augment our method to achieve SOTA performance.

> While maximizing deep neural networks' (DNNs') acceleration efficiency requires a joint search/design of three different yet highly coupled aspects, including the networks, bitwidths, and accelerators, the challenges associated with such a joint search have not yet been fully understood and addressed. The key challenges include (1) the dilemma of whether to explode the memory consumption due to the huge joint space or achieve sub-optimal designs, (2) the discrete nature of the accelerator design space that is coupled yet different from that of the networks and bitwidths, and (3) the chicken and egg problem associated with network-accelerator co-search, i.e., co-search requires operation-wise hardware cost, which is lacking during search as the optimal accelerator depending on the whole network is still unknown during search. To tackle these daunting challenges towards optimal and fast development of DNN accelerators, we propose a framework dubbed Auto-NBA to enable jointly searching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators, by efficiently localizing the optimal design within the huge joint design space for each target dataset and acceleration specification. Our Auto-NBA integrates a heterogeneous sampling strategy to achieve unbiased search with constant memory consumption, and a novel joint-search pipeline equipped with a generic differentiable accelerator search engine. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that both Auto-NBA generated networks and accelerators consistently outperform state-of-the-art designs (including co-search/exploration techniques, hardware-aware NAS methods, and DNN accelerators), in terms of search time, task accuracy, and accelerator efficiency.

> Self-supervised learning (SSL) for rich speech representations has achieved empirical success in low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and other speech processing tasks, which can mitigate the necessity of a large amount of transcribed speech and thus has driven a growing demand for on-device ASR and other speech processing. However, advanced speech SSL models have become increasingly large, which contradicts the limited on-device resources. This gap could be more severe in multilingual/multitask scenarios requiring simultaneously recognizing multiple languages or executing multiple speech processing tasks. Additionally, strongly overparameterized speech SSL models tend to suffer from overfitting when being finetuned on low-resource speech corpus. This work aims to enhance the practical usage of speech SSL models towards a win-win in both enhanced efficiency and alleviated overfitting via our proposed S$^3$-Router framework, which for the first time discovers that simply discarding no more than 10\% of model weights via only finetuning model connections of speech SSL models can achieve better accuracy over standard weight finetuning on downstream speech processing tasks. More importantly, S$^3$-Router can serve as an all-in-one technique to enable (1) a new finetuning scheme, (2) an efficient multilingual/multitask solution, (3) a state-of-the-art ASR pruning technique, and (4) a new tool to quantitatively analyze the learned speech representation. We believe S$^3$-Router has provided a new perspective for practical deployment of speech SSL models. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/S3-Router.

> Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., an imperceptible perturbation to the input can mislead DNNs trained on clean images into making erroneous predictions. To tackle this, adversarial training is currently the most effective defense method, by augmenting the training set with adversarial samples generated on the fly. Interestingly, we discover for the first time that there exist subnetworks with inborn robustness, matching or surpassing the robust accuracy of the adversarially trained networks with comparable model sizes, within randomly initialized networks without any model training, indicating that adversarial training on model weights is not indispensable towards adversarial robustness. We name such subnetworks Robust Scratch Tickets (RSTs), which are also by nature efficient. Distinct from the popular lottery ticket hypothesis, neither the original dense networks nor the identified RSTs need to be trained. To validate and understand this fascinating finding, we further conduct extensive experiments to study the existence and properties of RSTs under different models, datasets, sparsity patterns, and attacks, drawing insights regarding the relationship between DNNs' robustness and their initialization/overparameterization. Furthermore, we identify the poor adversarial transferability between RSTs of different sparsity ratios drawn from the same randomly initialized dense network, and propose a Random RST Switch (R2S) technique, which randomly switches between different RSTs, as a novel defense method built on top of RSTs. We believe our findings about RSTs have opened up a new perspective to study model robustness and extend the lottery ticket hypothesis.

> The recent breakthroughs of deep neural networks (DNNs) and the advent of billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have excited an explosive demand for intelligent IoT devices equipped with domain-specific DNN accelerators. However, the deployment of DNN accelerator enabled intelligent functionality into real-world IoT devices still remains particularly challenging. First, powerful DNNs often come at prohibitive complexities, whereas IoT devices often suffer from stringent resource constraints. Second, while DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks especially on IoT devices exposed to complex real-world environments, many IoT applications require strict security. Existing DNN accelerators mostly tackle only one of the two aforementioned challenges (i.e., efficiency or adversarial robustness) while neglecting or even sacrificing the other. To this end, we propose a 2-in-1 Accelerator, an integrated algorithm-accelerator co-design framework aiming at winning both the adversarial robustness and efficiency of DNN accelerators. Specifically, we first propose a Random Precision Switch (RPS) algorithm that can effectively defend DNNs against adversarial attacks by enabling random DNN quantization as an in-situ model switch. Furthermore, we propose a new precision-scalable accelerator featuring (1) a new precision-scalable MAC unit architecture which spatially tiles the temporal MAC units to boost both the achievable efficiency and flexibility and (2) a systematically optimized dataflow that is searched by our generic accelerator optimizer. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that our 2-in-1 Accelerator can not only aggressively boost both the adversarial robustness and efficiency of DNN accelerators under various attacks, but also naturally support instantaneous robustness-efficiency trade-offs adapting to varied resources without the necessity of DNN retraining.

> Driven by the explosive interest in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to numerous real-time control and decision-making applications, there has been a growing demand to deploy DRL agents to empower daily-life intelligent devices, while the prohibitive complexity of DRL stands at odds with limited on-device resources. In this work, we propose an Automated Agent Accelerator Co-Search (A3C-S) framework, which to our best knowledge is the first to automatically co-search the optimally matched DRL agents and accelerators that maximize both test scores and hardware efficiency. Extensive experiments consistently validate the superiority of our A3C-S over state-of-the-art techniques.

> Low-precision deep neural network (DNN) training has gained tremendous attention as reducing precision is one of the most effective knobs for boosting DNNs' training time/energy efficiency. In this paper, we attempt to explore low-precision training from a new perspective as inspired by recent findings in understanding DNN training: we conjecture that DNNs' precision might have a similar effect as the learning rate during DNN training, and advocate dynamic precision along the training trajectory for further boosting the time/energy efficiency of DNN training. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Precision Training (CPT) to cyclically vary the precision between two boundary values which can be identified using a simple precision range test within the first few training epochs. Extensive simulations and ablation studies on five datasets and eleven models demonstrate that CPT's effectiveness is consistent across various models/tasks (including classification and language modeling). Furthermore, through experiments and visualization we show that CPT helps to (1) converge to a wider minima with a lower generalization error and (2) reduce training variance which we believe opens up a new design knob for simultaneously improving the optimization and efficiency of DNN training.

> AlphaGo's astonishing performance has ignited an explosive interest in developing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for numerous real-world applications, such as intelligent robotics. However, the often prohibitive complexity of DRL stands at the odds with the required real-time control and constrained resources in many DRL applications, limiting the great potential of DRL powered intelligent devices. While substantial efforts have been devoted to compressing other deep learning models, existing works barely touch the surface of compressing DRL. In this work, we first identify that there exists an optimal model size of DRL that can maximize both the test scores and efficiency, motivating the need for task-specific DRL agents. We therefore propose an Auto-Agent-Distiller (A2D) framework, which to our best knowledge is the first neural architecture search (NAS) applied to DRL to automatically search for the optimal DRL agents for various tasks that optimize both the test scores and efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that vanilla NAS can easily fail in searching for the optimal agents, due to its resulting high variance in DRL training stability, and then develop a novel distillation mechanism to distill the knowledge from both the teacher agent's actor and critic to stabilize the searching process and improve the searched agents' optimality. Extensive experiments and ablation studies consistently validate our findings and the advantages and general applicability of our A2D, outperforming manually designed DRL in both the test scores and efficiency. All the codes will be released upon acceptance.

> Powerful yet complex deep neural networks (DNNs) have fueled a booming demand for efficient DNN solutions to bring DNN-powered intelligence into numerous applications. Jointly optimizing the networks and their accelerators are promising in providing optimal performance. However, the great potential of such solutions have yet to be unleashed due to the challenge of simultaneously exploring the vast and entangled, yet different design spaces of the networks and their accelerators. To this end, we propose DNA, a Differentiable Network-Accelerator co-search framework for automatically searching for matched networks and accelerators to maximize both the task accuracy and acceleration efficiency. Specifically, DNA integrates two enablers: (1) a generic design space for DNN accelerators that is applicable to both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN accelerators and compatible with DNN frameworks such as PyTorch to enable algorithmic exploration for more efficient DNNs and their accelerators; and (2) a joint DNN network and accelerator co-search algorithm that enables simultaneously searching for optimal DNN structures and their accelerators' micro-architectures and mapping methods to maximize both the task accuracy and acceleration efficiency. Experiments and ablation studies based on FPGA measurements and ASIC synthesis show that the matched networks and accelerators generated by DNA consistently outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs and DNN accelerators (e.g., 3.04x better FPS with a 5.46% higher accuracy on ImageNet), while requiring notably reduced search time (up to 1234.3x) over SOTA co-exploration methods, when evaluated over ten SOTA baselines on three datasets.

> The compression of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has lately drawn attention, due to the increasing demand for deploying GANs into mobile devices for numerous applications such as image translation, enhancement and editing. However, compared to the substantial efforts to compressing other deep models, the research on compressing GANs (usually the generators) remains at its infancy stage. Existing GAN compression algorithms are limited to handling specific GAN architectures and losses. Inspired by the recent success of AutoML in deep compression, we introduce AutoML to GAN compression and develop an AutoGAN-Distiller (AGD) framework. Starting with a specifically designed efficient search space, AGD performs an end-to-end discovery for new efficient generators, given the target computational resource constraints. The search is guided by the original GAN model via knowledge distillation, therefore fulfilling the compression. AGD is fully automatic, standalone (i.e., needing no trained discriminators), and generically applicable to various GAN models. We evaluate AGD in two representative GAN tasks: image translation and super resolution. Without bells and whistles, AGD yields remarkably lightweight yet more competitive compressed models, that largely outperform existing alternatives. Our codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/AGD.

> In numerous episodic reinforcement learning (RL) settings, SARSA-based methodologies are employed to enhance policies aimed at maximizing returns over long horizons. Conventional SARSA algorithms, however, have difficulties in balancing bias and variation due to the reliance on a singular, fixed discount factor. This study expands the temporal difference decomposition approach, TD($\Delta$), to the SARSA algorithm, which we designate as SARSA($\Delta$). SARSA, a widely utilised on-policy RL method, enhances action-value functions via temporal difference updates. TD($\Delta$) facilitates learning over several time-scales by breaking the action-value function into components associated with distinct discount factors. This decomposition improves learning efficiency and stability, particularly in problems necessitating long-horizon optimization. We illustrate that our methodology mitigates bias in SARSA's updates while facilitating accelerated convergence in both deterministic and stochastic environments. Experimental findings across many benchmark tasks indicate that the proposed SARSA($\Delta$) surpasses conventional TD learning methods in both tabular and deep RL environments.

> Prior work has established Test-Time Training (TTT) as a general framework to further improve a trained model at test time. Before making a prediction on each test instance, the model is first trained on the same instance using a self-supervised task such as reconstruction. We extend TTT to the streaming setting, where multiple test instances - video frames in our case - arrive in temporal order. Our extension is online TTT: The current model is initialized from the previous model, then trained on the current frame and a small window of frames immediately before. Online TTT significantly outperforms the fixed-model baseline for four tasks, on three real-world datasets. The improvements are more than 2.2x and 1.5x for instance and panoptic segmentation. Surprisingly, online TTT also outperforms its offline variant that accesses strictly more information, training on all frames from the entire test video regardless of temporal order. This finding challenges those in prior work using synthetic videos. We formalize a notion of locality as the advantage of online over offline TTT, and analyze its role with ablations and a theory based on bias-variance trade-off.

> Exploiting the power of pre-trained models, prompt-based approaches stand out compared to other continual learning solutions in effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting, even with very few learnable parameters and without the need for a memory buffer. While existing prompt-based continual learning methods excel in leveraging prompts for state-of-the-art performance, they often lack a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of prompting. This paper conducts a theoretical analysis to unravel how prompts bestow such advantages in continual learning, thus offering a new perspective on prompt design. We first show that the attention block of pre-trained models like Vision Transformers inherently encodes a special mixture of experts architecture, characterized by linear experts and quadratic gating score functions. This realization drives us to provide a novel view on prefix tuning, reframing it as the addition of new task-specific experts, thereby inspiring the design of a novel gating mechanism termed Non-linear Residual Gates (NoRGa). Through the incorporation of non-linear activation and residual connection, NoRGa enhances continual learning performance while preserving parameter efficiency. The effectiveness of NoRGa is substantiated both theoretically and empirically across diverse benchmarks and pretraining paradigms.

> For servers incorporating parallel computing resources, batching is a pivotal technique for providing efficient and economical services at scale. Parallel computing resources exhibit heightened computational and energy efficiency when operating with larger batch sizes. However, in the realm of online services, the adoption of a larger batch size may lead to longer response times. This paper aims to provide a dynamic batching scheme that delicately balances latency and efficiency. The system is modeled as a batch service queue with size-dependent service times. Then, the design of dynamic batching is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problem, with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average response time and average power consumption. A method is proposed to derive an approximate optimal SMDP solution, representing the chosen dynamic batching policy. By introducing an abstract cost to reflect the impact of "tail" states, the space complexity and the time complexity of the procedure can decrease by 63.5% and 98%, respectively. Numerical results showcase the superiority of SMDP-based batching policies across various parameter setups. Additionally, the proposed scheme exhibits noteworthy flexibility in balancing power consumption and latency.

> Membership inference attacks have emerged as a significant privacy concern in the training of deep learning models, where attackers can infer whether a data point was part of the training set based on the model's outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense mechanism, AdaMixup. AdaMixup employs adaptive mixup techniques to enhance the model's robustness against membership inference attacks by dynamically adjusting the mixup strategy during training. This method not only improves the model's privacy protection but also maintains high performance. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that AdaMixup significantly reduces the risk of membership inference attacks while achieving a favorable trade-off between defensive efficiency and model accuracy. This research provides an effective solution for data privacy protection and lays the groundwork for future advancements in mixup training methods.

> Stream Learning (SL) requires models that can quickly adapt to continuously evolving data, posing significant challenges in both computational efficiency and learning accuracy. Effective data selection is critical in SL to ensure a balance between information retention and training efficiency. Traditional rule-based data selection methods struggle to accommodate the dynamic nature of streaming data, highlighting the necessity for innovative solutions that effectively address these challenges. Recent approaches to handling changing data distributions face challenges that limit their effectiveness in fast-paced environments. In response, we propose StreamFP, a novel approach that uniquely employs dynamic, learnable parameters called fingerprints to enhance data selection efficiency and adaptability in stream learning. StreamFP optimizes coreset selection through its unique fingerprint-guided mechanism for efficient training while ensuring robust buffer updates that adaptively respond to data dynamics, setting it apart from existing methods in stream learning. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamFP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving accuracy improvements of 15.99%, 29.65%, and 51.24% compared to baseline models across varying data arrival rates, alongside a training throughput increase of 4.6x.

> We study learning-augmented streaming algorithms for estimating the value of MAX-CUT in a graph. In the classical streaming model, while a $1/2$-approximation for estimating the value of MAX-CUT can be trivially achieved with $O(1)$ words of space, Kapralov and Krachun [STOC'19] showed that this is essentially the best possible: for any $\epsilon > 0$, any (randomized) single-pass streaming algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of at least $1/2 + \epsilon$ requires $\Omega(n / 2^{\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)})$ space. We show that it is possible to surpass the $1/2$-approximation barrier using just $O(1)$ words of space by leveraging a (machine learned) oracle. Specifically, we consider streaming algorithms that are equipped with an $\epsilon$-accurate oracle that for each vertex in the graph, returns its correct label in $\{-1, +1\}$, corresponding to an optimal MAX-CUT solution in the graph, with some probability $1/2 + \epsilon$, and the incorrect label otherwise. Within this framework, we present a single-pass algorithm that approximates the value of MAX-CUT to within a factor of $1/2 + \Omega(\epsilon^2)$ with probability at least $2/3$ for insertion-only streams, using only $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ words of space. We also extend our algorithm to fully dynamic streams while maintaining a space complexity of $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon,\log n)$ words.

> Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

> Recent medical image reconstruction techniques focus on generating high-quality medical images suitable for clinical use at the lowest possible cost and with the fewest possible adverse effects on patients. Recent works have shown significant promise for reconstructing MR images from sparsely sampled k-space data using deep learning. In this work, we propose a technique that rapidly estimates deep neural networks directly at reconstruction time by fitting them on small adaptively estimated neighborhoods of a training set. In brief, our algorithm alternates between searching for neighbors in a data set that are similar to the test reconstruction, and training a local network on these neighbors followed by updating the test reconstruction. Because our reconstruction model is learned on a dataset that is in some sense similar to the image being reconstructed rather than being fit on a large, diverse training set, it is more adaptive to new scans. It can also handle changes in training sets and flexible scan settings, while being relatively fast. Our approach, dubbed LONDN-MRI, was validated on multiple data sets using deep unrolled reconstruction networks. Reconstructions were performed at four fold and eight fold undersampling of k-space with 1D variable-density random phase-encode undersampling masks. Our results demonstrate that our proposed locally-trained method produces higher-quality reconstructions compared to models trained globally on larger datasets as well as other scan-adaptive methods.

> Missing data imputation, which aims to impute the missing values in the raw datasets to achieve the completeness of datasets, is crucial for modern data-driven models like large language models (LLMs) and has attracted increasing interest over the past decades. Despite its importance, existing solutions for missing data imputation either 1) only support numerical and categorical data or 2) show an unsatisfactory performance due to their design prioritizing text data and the lack of key properties for tabular data imputation. In this paper, we propose UnIMP, a Unified IMPutation framework that leverages LLM and high-order message passing to enhance the imputation of mixed-type data including numerical, categorical, and text data. Specifically, we first introduce a cell-oriented hypergraph to model the table. We then propose BiHMP, an efficient Bidirectional High-order Message-Passing network to aggregate global-local information and high-order relationships on the constructed hypergraph while capturing the inter-column heterogeneity and intra-column homogeneity. To effectively and efficiently align the capacity of the LLM with the information aggregated by BiHMP, we introduce Xfusion, which, together with BiHMP, acts as adapters for the LLM. We follow a pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline to train UnIMP, integrating two optimizations: chunking technique, which divides tables into smaller chunks to enhance efficiency; and progressive masking technique, which gradually adapts the model to learn more complex data patterns. Both theoretical proofs and empirical experiments on 10 real world datasets highlight the superiority of UnIMP over existing techniques.

> The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant, approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence. To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows, where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/k-flouris/gfe}.}

> Generative relation extraction (RE) commonly involves first reformulating RE as a linguistic modeling problem easily tackled with pre-trained language models (PLM) and then fine-tuning a PLM with supervised cross-entropy loss. Although having achieved promising performance, existing approaches assume only one deterministic relation between each pair of entities without considering real scenarios where multiple relations may be valid, i.e., entity pair overlap, causing their limited applications. To address this problem, we introduce a novel contrastive prompt tuning method for RE, CPTuning, which learns to associate a candidate relation between two in-context entities with a probability mass above or below a threshold, corresponding to whether the relation exists. Beyond learning schema, CPTuning also organizes RE as a verbalized relation generation task and uses Trie-constrained decoding to ensure a model generates valid relations. It adaptively picks out the generated candidate relations with a high estimated likelihood in inference, thereby achieving multi-relation extraction. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used datasets to validate our method. Results show that T5-large fine-tuned with CPTuning significantly outperforms previous methods, regardless of single or multiple relations extraction.

> The generalized lasso is a natural generalization of the celebrated lasso approach to handle structural regularization problems. Many important methods and applications fall into this framework, including fused lasso, clustered lasso, and constrained lasso. To elevate its effectiveness in large-scale problems, extensive research has been conducted on the computational strategies of generalized lasso. However, to our knowledge, most studies are under the linear setup, with limited advances in non-Gaussian and non-linear models. We propose a majorization-minimization dual stagewise (MM-DUST) algorithm to efficiently trace out the full solution paths of the generalized lasso problem. The majorization technique is incorporated to handle different convex loss functions through their quadratic majorizers. Utilizing the connection between primal and dual problems and the idea of ``slow-brewing'' from stagewise learning, the minimization step is carried out in the dual space through a sequence of simple coordinate-wise updates on the dual coefficients with a small step size. Consequently, selecting an appropriate step size enables a trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. We analyze the computational complexity of MM-DUST and establish the uniform convergence of the approximated solution paths. Extensive simulation studies and applications with regularized logistic regression and Cox model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

> Continual Learning enables models to learn and adapt to new tasks while retaining prior knowledge.Introducing new tasks, however, can naturally lead to feature entanglement across tasks, limiting the model's capability to distinguish between new domain data.In this work, we propose a method called Feature Realignment through Experts on hyperSpHere in Continual Learning (Fresh-CL). By leveraging predefined and fixed simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) classifiers on a hypersphere, our model improves feature separation both intra and inter tasks.However, the projection to a simplex ETF shifts with new tasks, disrupting structured feature representation of previous tasks and degrading performance. Therefore, we propose a dynamic extension of ETF through mixture of experts, enabling adaptive projections onto diverse subspaces to enhance feature representation.Experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate a 2\% improvement in accuracy compared to the strongest baseline, particularly in fine-grained datasets, confirming the efficacy of combining ETF and MoE to improve feature distinction in continual learning scenarios.

- *Taegu Kim, Tae Sup Yun, Hyoung Suk Suh*

- `2501.02199v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02199v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02199v1)

> This study assesses the capability of ChatGPT to generate finite element code for geotechnical engineering applications from a set of prompts. We tested three different initial boundary value problems using a hydro-mechanically coupled formulation for unsaturated soils, including the dissipation of excess pore water pressure through fluid mass diffusion in one-dimensional space, time-dependent differential settlement of a strip footing, and gravity-driven seepage. For each case, initial prompting involved providing ChatGPT with necessary information for finite element implementation, such as balance and constitutive equations, problem geometry, initial and boundary conditions, material properties, and spatiotemporal discretization and solution strategies. Any errors and unexpected results were further addressed through prompt augmentation processes until the ChatGPT-generated finite element code passed the verification/validation test. Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT required minimal code revisions when using the FEniCS finite element library, owing to its high-level interfaces that enable efficient programming. In contrast, the MATLAB code generated by ChatGPT necessitated extensive prompt augmentations and/or direct human intervention, as it involves a significant amount of low-level programming required for finite element analysis, such as constructing shape functions or assembling global matrices. Given that prompt engineering for this task requires an understanding of the mathematical formulation and numerical techniques, this study suggests that while a large language model may not yet replace human programmers, it can greatly assist in the implementation of numerical models.

> Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) maintain populations through evolutionary operators to discover diverse solutions for complex tasks while gathering valuable knowledge, such as historical population data and fitness evaluations. However, traditional EAs face challenges in dynamically adapting to expanding knowledge bases, hindering the efficient exploitation of accumulated information and limiting adaptability to new situations. To address these issues, we introduce an Optimization Knowledge Adaptation Evolutionary Model (OKAEM), which features dynamic parameter adjustment using accumulated knowledge to enhance its optimization capabilities. OKAEM employs attention mechanisms to model the interactions among individuals, fitness landscapes, and genetic components separately, thereby parameterizing the evolutionary operators of selection, crossover, and mutation. These powerful learnable operators enable OKAEM to benefit from pre-learned extensive prior knowledge and self-tune with real-time evolutionary insights. Experimental results demonstrate that OKAEM: 1) exploits prior knowledge for significant performance gains across various knowledge transfer settings; 2) achieves competitive performance through self-tuning alone, even without prior knowledge; 3) outperforms state-of-the-art black-box baselines in a vision-language model tuning case; 4) can improve its optimization capabilities with growing knowledge; 5) is capable of emulating principles of natural selection and genetic recombination.

> Many recent IT companies use cloud services for deploying their products, mainly because of their convenience. As such, cloud assets have become a new attack surface, and the concept of cloud security has emerged. However, cloud security is not emphasized enough compared to on-premise security, resulting in many insecure cloud architectures. In particular, small organizations often don't have enough human resources to design a secure architecture, leaving them vulnerable to cloud security breaches.   We suggest the multi-account strategy for securing the cloud architecture. This strategy cost-effectively improves security by separating assets and reducing management overheads on the cloud infrastructure. When implemented, it automatically provides access restriction within the boundary of an account and eliminates redundancies in policy management. Since access control is a critical objective for constructing secure architectures, this practical method successfully enhances security even in small companies.   In this paper, we analyze the benefits of multi-accounts compared to single accounts and explain how to deploy multiple accounts effortlessly using the services provided by AWS. Then, we present possible design choices for multi-account structures with a concrete example. Finally, we illustrate two techniques for operational excellence on multi-account structures. We take an incremental approach to secure policy management with the principle of least privilege and introduce methods for auditing multiple accounts.

> This paper presents a novel methodological framework, called the Actor-Simulator, that incorporates the calibration of digital twins into model-based reinforcement learning for more effective control of stochastic systems with complex nonlinear dynamics. Traditional model-based control often relies on restrictive structural assumptions (such as linear state transitions) and fails to account for parameter uncertainty in the model. These issues become particularly critical in industries such as biopharmaceutical manufacturing, where process dynamics are complex and not fully known, and only a limited amount of data is available. Our approach jointly calibrates the digital twin and searches for an optimal control policy, thus accounting for and reducing model error. We balance exploration and exploitation by using policy performance as a guide for data collection. This dual-component approach provably converges to the optimal policy, and outperforms existing methods in extensive numerical experiments based on the biopharmaceutical manufacturing domain.

> The emergence of 5G and edge computing hardware has brought about a significant shift in artificial intelligence, with edge AI becoming a crucial technology for enabling intelligent applications. With the growing amount of data generated and stored on edge devices, deploying AI models for local processing and inference has become increasingly necessary. However, deploying state-of-the-art AI models on resource-constrained edge devices faces significant challenges that must be addressed. This paper presents an optimization triad for efficient and reliable edge AI deployment, including data, model, and system optimization. First, we discuss optimizing data through data cleaning, compression, and augmentation to make it more suitable for edge deployment. Second, we explore model design and compression methods at the model level, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. Finally, we introduce system optimization techniques like framework support and hardware acceleration to accelerate edge AI workflows. Based on an in-depth analysis of various application scenarios and deployment challenges of edge AI, this paper proposes an optimization paradigm based on the data-model-system triad to enable a whole set of solutions to effectively transfer ML models, which are initially trained in the cloud, to various edge devices for supporting multiple scenarios.

> We consider the robust multi-dimensional scaling (RMDS) problem in this paper. The goal is to localize point locations from pairwise distances that may be corrupted by outliers. Inspired by classic MDS theories, and nonconvex works for the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) problem, we propose an alternating projection based algorithm that is further accelerated by the tangent space projection technique. For the proposed algorithm, if the outliers are sparse enough, we can establish linear convergence of the reconstructed points to the original points after centering and rotation alignment. Numerical experiments verify the state-of-the-art performances of the proposed algorithm.

> LLM safety and ethical alignment are widely discussed, but the impact of content moderation on user satisfaction remains underexplored. To address this, we analyze nearly 50,000 Chatbot Arena response-pairs using a novel fine-tuned RoBERTa model, that we trained on hand-labeled data to disentangle refusals due to ethical concerns from other refusals due to technical disabilities or lack of information. Our findings reveal a significant refusal penalty on content moderation, with users choosing ethical-based refusals roughly one-fourth as often as their preferred LLM response compared to standard responses. However, the context and phrasing play critical roles: refusals on highly sensitive prompts, such as illegal content, achieve higher win rates than less sensitive ethical concerns, and longer responses closely aligned with the prompt perform better. These results emphasize the need for nuanced moderation strategies that balance ethical safeguards with user satisfaction. Moreover, we find that the refusal penalty is notably lower in evaluations using the LLM-as-a-Judge method, highlighting discrepancies between user and automated assessments.

> Existing methodologies for animating portrait images face significant challenges, particularly in handling non-frontal perspectives, rendering dynamic objects around the portrait, and generating immersive, realistic backgrounds. In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes.

> Vision-Language Models trained on massive collections of human-generated data often reproduce and amplify societal stereotypes. One critical form of stereotyping reproduced by these models is homogeneity bias-the tendency to represent certain groups as more homogeneous than others. We investigate how this bias responds to hyperparameter adjustments in GPT-4, specifically examining sampling temperature and top p which control the randomness of model outputs. By generating stories about individuals from different racial and gender groups and comparing their similarities using vector representations, we assess both bias robustness and its relationship with hyperparameter values. We find that (1) homogeneity bias persists across most hyperparameter configurations, with Black Americans and women being represented more homogeneously than White Americans and men, (2) the relationship between hyperparameters and group representations shows unexpected non-linear patterns, particularly at extreme values, and (3) hyperparameter adjustments affect racial and gender homogeneity bias differently-while increasing temperature or decreasing top p can reduce racial homogeneity bias, these changes show different effects on gender homogeneity bias. Our findings suggest that while hyperparameter tuning may mitigate certain biases to some extent, it cannot serve as a universal solution for addressing homogeneity bias across different social group dimensions.

> Prevalent Fault Localization (FL) techniques rely on tests to localize buggy program elements. Tests could be treated as fuel to further boost FL by providing more debugging information. Therefore, it is highly valuable to measure the Fault Diagnosis Capability (FDC) of a test for diagnosing faults, so as to select or generate tests to better help FL. To this end, researchers have proposed many FDC metrics, which serve as the selection criterion in FL-oriented test selection or the fitness function in FL-oriented test generation. Existing FDC metrics can be classified into result-agnostic and result-aware metrics depending on whether they take test results (i.e., passing or failing) as input. Although result-aware metrics perform better in test selection, they have restricted applications due to the input of test results, e.g., they cannot be applied to guide test generation. Moreover, all the existing FDC metrics are designed based on some predefined heuristics and have achieved limited FL performance due to their inaccuracy. To address these issues, in this paper, we reconsider result-agnostic metrics, and propose a novel result-agnostic metric RLFDC which predicts FDC values of tests through reinforcement learning. In particular, we treat FL results as reward signals, and train an FDC prediction model with the direct FL feedback to automatically learn a more accurate measurement rather than design one based on predefined heuristics. Finally, we evaluate the proposed RLFDC on Defects4J by applying the studied metrics to test selection and generation. According to the experimental results, the proposed RLFDC outperforms all the result-agnostic metrics in both test selection and generation.

> Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) is primarily challenged by two factors: the scarcity of labeled data across clients and the non-independent and identically distribution (non-IID) nature of data among clients. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, diffusion model-based data synthesis aided FSSL (DDSA-FSSL), which utilizes a diffusion model (DM) to generate synthetic data, bridging the gap between heterogeneous local data distributions and the global data distribution. In DDSA-FSSL, clients address the challenge of the scarcity of labeled data by employing a federated learning-trained classifier to perform pseudo labeling for unlabeled data. The DM is then collaboratively trained using both labeled and precision-optimized pseudo-labeled data, enabling clients to generate synthetic samples for classes that are absent in their labeled datasets. This process allows clients to generate more comprehensive synthetic datasets aligned with the global distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and varying non-IID distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of DDSA-FSSL, e.g., it improves accuracy from 38.46% to 52.14% on CIFAR-10 datasets with 10% labeled data.

> Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to develop agents that can collaborate effectively. However, most cooperative MARL methods overfit training agents, making learned policies not generalize well to unseen collaborators, which is a critical issue for real-world deployment. Some methods attempt to address the generalization problem but require prior knowledge or predefined policies of new teammates, limiting real-world applications. To this end, we propose a hierarchical MARL approach to enable generalizable cooperation via role diversity, namely CORD. CORD's high-level controller assigns roles to low-level agents by maximizing the role entropy with constraints. We show this constrained objective can be decomposed into causal influence in role that enables reasonable role assignment, and role heterogeneity that yields coherent, non-redundant role clusters. Evaluated on a variety of cooperative multi-agent tasks, CORD achieves better performance than baselines, especially in generalization tests. Ablation studies further demonstrate the efficacy of the constrained objective in generalizable cooperation.

> High-level synthesis (HLS) is a widely used tool in designing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). HLS enables FPGA design with software programming languages by compiling the source code into an FPGA circuit. The source code includes a program (called ``kernel'') and several pragmas that instruct hardware synthesis, such as parallelization, pipeline, etc. While it is relatively easy for software developers to design the program, it heavily relies on hardware knowledge to design the pragmas, posing a big challenge for software developers. Recently, different machine learning algorithms, such as GNNs, have been proposed to automate the pragma design via performance prediction. However, when applying the trained model on new kernels, the significant domain shift often leads to unsatisfactory performance. We propose a more domain-generalizable model structure: a two-level hierarchical Mixture of Experts (MoE), that can be flexibly adapted to any GNN model. Different expert networks can learn to deal with different regions in the representation space, and they can utilize similar patterns between the old kernels and new kernels. In the low-level MoE, we apply MoE on three natural granularities of a program: node, basic block, and graph. The high-level MoE learns to aggregate the three granularities for the final decision. To stably train the hierarchical MoE, we further propose a two-stage training method. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the hierarchical MoE.

> The use of denoising diffusion models is becoming increasingly popular in the field of image editing. However, current approaches often rely on either image-guided methods, which provide a visual reference but lack control over semantic consistency, or text-guided methods, which ensure alignment with the text guidance but compromise visual quality. To resolve this issue, we propose a framework that integrates a fusion of generated visual references and text guidance into the semantic latent space of a \textit{frozen} pre-trained diffusion model. Using only a tiny neural network, our framework provides control over diverse content and attributes, driven intuitively by the text prompt. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the framework generates images of higher quality while providing realistic editing effects across various benchmark datasets.

> Recent AI-based 3D content creation has largely evolved along two paths: feed-forward image-to-3D reconstruction approaches and 3D generative models trained with 2D or 3D supervision. In this work, we show that existing feed-forward reconstruction methods can serve as effective latent encoders for training 3D generative models, thereby bridging these two paradigms. By reusing powerful pre-trained reconstruction models, we avoid computationally expensive encoder network training and obtain rich 3D latent features for generative modeling for free. However, the latent spaces of reconstruction models are not well-suited for generative modeling due to their unstructured nature. To enable flow-based model training on these latent features, we develop post-processing pipelines, including protocols to standardize the features and spatial weighting to concentrate on important regions. We further incorporate a 2D image space perceptual rendering loss to handle the high-dimensional latent spaces. Finally, we propose a multi-stream transformer-based rectified flow architecture to achieve linear scaling and high-quality text-conditioned 3D generation. Our framework leverages the advancements of feed-forward reconstruction models to enhance the scalability of 3D generative modeling, achieving both high computational efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in text-to-3D generation.

> As blockchain technology and smart contracts become widely adopted, securing them throughout every stage of the transaction process is essential. The concern of improved security for smart contracts is to find and detect vulnerabilities using classical Machine Learning (ML) models and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLM). The robustness of such work rests on a labeled smart contract dataset that includes annotated vulnerabilities on which several LLMs alongside various traditional machine learning algorithms such as DistilBERT model is trained and tested. We train and test machine learning algorithms to classify smart contract codes according to vulnerability types in order to compare model performance. Having fine-tuned the LLMs specifically for smart contract code classification should help in getting better results when detecting several types of well-known vulnerabilities, such as Reentrancy, Integer Overflow, Timestamp Dependency and Dangerous Delegatecall. From our initial experimental results, it can be seen that our fine-tuned LLM surpasses the accuracy of any other model by achieving an accuracy of over 90%, and this advances the existing vulnerability detection benchmarks. Such performance provides a great deal of evidence for LLMs ability to describe the subtle patterns in the code that traditional ML models could miss. Thus, we compared each of the ML and LLM models to give a good overview of each models strengths, from which we can choose the most effective one for real-world applications in smart contract security. Our research combines machine learning and large language models to provide a rich and interpretable framework for detecting different smart contract vulnerabilities, which lays a foundation for a more secure blockchain ecosystem.

> Meteorological factors (MF) are crucial in day-ahead load forecasting as they significantly influence the electricity consumption behaviors of consumers. Numerous studies have incorporated MF into the load forecasting model to achieve higher accuracy. Selecting MF from one representative location or the averaged MF as the inputs of the forecasting model is a common practice. However, the difference in MF collected in various locations within a region may be significant, which poses a challenge in selecting the appropriate MF from numerous locations. A representation learning framework is proposed to extract geo-distributed MF while considering their spatial relationships. In addition, this paper employs the Shapley value in the graph-based model to reveal connections between MF collected in different locations and loads. To reduce the computational complexity of calculating the Shapley value, an acceleration method is adopted based on Monte Carlo sampling and weighted linear regression. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves the day-ahead forecasting accuracy, especially in extreme scenarios such as the "accumulation temperature effect" in summer and "sudden temperature change" in winter. We also find a significant correlation between the importance of MF in different locations and the corresponding area's GDP and mainstay industry.

> The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Additionally, quantum circuits effectively replace MLPs by inherently preserving symmetries, with Lorentz symmetry integration ensuring robust handling of relativistic invariance. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved 74.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 87.38% on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached 67.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 68.20%, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving 88.10% and 74.80% test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.

> Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with classic first-order optimizers entails prohibitive GPU memory due to the backpropagation process. Recent works have turned to zeroth-order optimizers for fine-tuning, which save substantial memory by using two forward passes. However, these optimizers are plagued by the heterogeneity of parameter curvatures across different dimensions. In this work, we propose HiZOO, a diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimizer which is the first work to leverage the diagonal Hessian to enhance zeroth-order optimizer for fine-tuning LLMs. What's more, HiZOO avoids the expensive memory cost and only increases one forward pass per step.

> Recent works have proven the effectiveness of k-nearest-neighbor machine translation(a.k.a kNN-MT) approaches to produce remarkable improvement in cross-domain translations. However, these models suffer from heavy retrieve overhead on the entire datastore when decoding each token. We observe that during the decoding phase, about 67% to 84% of tokens are unvaried after searching over the corpus datastore, which means most of the tokens cause futile retrievals and introduce unnecessary computational costs by initiating k-nearest-neighbor searches. We consider this phenomenon is explainable in linguistics and propose a simple yet effective multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to predict whether a token should be translated jointly by the neural machine translation model and probabilities produced by the kNN or just by the neural model. The results show that our method succeeds in reducing redundant retrieval operations and significantly reduces the overhead of kNN retrievals by up to 53% at the expense of a slight decline in translation quality. Moreover, our method could work together with all existing kNN-MT systems.

> Deep learning-based speech enhancement (SE) methods often face significant computational challenges when needing to meet low-latency requirements because of the increased number of frames to be processed. This paper introduces the SlowFast framework which aims to reduce computation costs specifically when low-latency enhancement is needed. The framework consists of a slow branch that analyzes the acoustic environment at a low frame rate, and a fast branch that performs SE in the time domain at the needed higher frame rate to match the required latency. Specifically, the fast branch employs a state space model where its state transition process is dynamically modulated by the slow branch. Experiments on a SE task with a 2 ms algorithmic latency requirement using the Voice Bank + Demand dataset show that our approach reduces computation cost by 70% compared to a baseline single-branch network with equivalent parameters, without compromising enhancement performance. Furthermore, by leveraging the SlowFast framework, we implemented a network that achieves an algorithmic latency of just 62.5 {\mu}s (one sample point at 16 kHz sample rate) with a computation cost of 100 M MACs/s, while scoring a PESQ-NB of 3.12 and SISNR of 16.62.

> Efficient prediction of default risk for bond-issuing enterprises is pivotal for maintaining stability and fostering growth in the bond market. Conventional methods usually rely solely on an enterprise's internal data for risk assessment. In contrast, graph-based techniques leverage interconnected corporate information to enhance default risk identification for targeted bond issuers. Traditional graph techniques such as label propagation algorithm or deepwalk fail to effectively integrate a enterprise's inherent attribute information with its topological network data. Additionally, due to data scarcity and security privacy concerns between enterprises, end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) algorithms may struggle in delivering satisfactory performance for target tasks. To address these challenges, we present a novel two-stage model. In the first stage, we employ an innovative Masked Autoencoders for Heterogeneous Graph (HGMAE) to pre-train on a vast enterprise knowledge graph. Subsequently, in the second stage, a specialized classifier model is trained to predict default risk propagation probabilities. The classifier leverages concatenated feature vectors derived from the pre-trained encoder with the enterprise's task-specific feature vectors. Through the two-stage training approach, our model not only boosts the importance of unique bond characteristics for specific default prediction tasks, but also securely and efficiently leverage the global information pre-trained from other enterprises. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing approaches in predicting default risk for bond issuers.

> Despite significant advancements in Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation models achieving high-fidelity audio with fine-grained context understanding, they struggle to model the relations between audio events described in the input text. However, previous TTA methods have not systematically explored audio event relation modeling, nor have they proposed frameworks to enhance this capability. In this work, we systematically study audio event relation modeling in TTA generation models. We first establish a benchmark for this task by: 1. proposing a comprehensive relation corpus covering all potential relations in real-world scenarios; 2. introducing a new audio event corpus encompassing commonly heard audios; and 3. proposing new evaluation metrics to assess audio event relation modeling from various perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning framework to enhance existing TTA models ability to model audio events relation. Code is available at: https://github.com/yuhanghe01/RiTTA

> This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.

These systems have gained popularity due to the wide availability of low-cost surveillance cameras and advances in Deep Learning. Typically, video-based ALPR systems rely on multiple frames to detect the vehicle and recognize the license plates. Therefore, we propose a system capable of extracting exactly one frame per vehicle and recognizing its license plate characters from this singular image using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model.

> Model merging offers an efficient way to combine pre-trained neural networks but often suffers from inconsistent performance, especially when merging models with different initializations. We identify the ``vanishing feature'' phenomenon, where input-induced features diminish during propagation through the merged model, degrading performance. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we reveal that this phenomenon underpins challenges like variance collapse and explains techniques like permutation-based merging, post-merging normalization, etc. We show that existing normalization strategies can be enhanced by precisely targeting the vanishing feature issue. Leveraging these insights, we propose the ``Preserve-First Merging'' (PFM) strategy, which focuses on preserving early-layer features, enabling the merged models, for the first time, to outperform the original models in advanced settings without post-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vanishing feature phenomenon extends to other contexts, such as model pruning. Applying post-pruning normalization to mitigate the issue significantly improves one-shot pruning performance at high sparsity, offering a simple and effective post-pruning solution.

> Machine unlearning in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has attracted great attention recently, which aims to effectively eliminate undesirable behaviors from LLMs without full retraining from scratch. In this paper, we explore the Gradient Ascent (GA) approach in LLM unlearning, which is a proactive way to decrease the prediction probability of the model on the target data in order to remove their influence. We analyze two challenges that render the process impractical: gradient explosion and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Objective Large Language Model Unlearning (MOLLM) algorithm. We first formulate LLM unlearning as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the cross-entropy loss is modified to the unlearning version to overcome the gradient explosion issue. A common descent update direction is then calculated, which enables the model to forget the target data while preserving the utility of the LLM. Our empirical results verify that MoLLM outperforms the SOTA GA-based LLM unlearning methods in terms of unlearning effect and model utility preservation.

> Ischemic stroke, caused by cerebral vessel occlusion, presents substantial challenges in medical imaging due to the variability and subtlety of stroke lesions. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing ischemic stroke, yet existing segmentation techniques often fail to accurately delineate lesions. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based method for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions using multi-channel MRI modalities, including Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), and enhanced Diffusion Weighted Imaging (eDWI). The proposed architecture integrates DenseNet121 as the encoder with Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (SelfONN) in the decoder, enhanced by Channel and Space Compound Attention (CSCA) and Double Squeeze-and-Excitation (DSE) blocks. Additionally, a custom loss function combining Dice Loss and Jaccard Loss with weighted averages is introduced to improve model performance. Trained and evaluated on the ISLES 2022 dataset, the model achieved Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 83.88% using DWI alone, 85.86% with DWI and ADC, and 87.49% with the integration of DWI, ADC, and eDWI. This approach not only outperforms existing methods but also addresses key limitations in current segmentation practices. These advancements significantly enhance diagnostic precision and treatment planning for ischemic stroke, providing valuable support for clinical decision-making.

We embed a publicly-verifiable cryptographic signature into LM output using rejection sampling and prove that this produces unforgeable and distortion-free (i.e., undetectable without access to the public key) text output. We make use of error-correction to overcome periods of low entropy, a barrier for all prior watermarking schemes. We implement our scheme and find that our formal claims are met in practice.

> Phytoplankton are a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems, and effective monitoring of them can provide valuable insights into ocean environments and ecosystem changes. Traditional phytoplankton monitoring methods are often complex and lack timely analysis. Therefore, deep learning algorithms offer a promising approach for automated phytoplankton monitoring. However, the lack of large-scale, high-quality training samples has become a major bottleneck in advancing phytoplankton tracking. In this paper, we propose a challenging benchmark dataset, Multiple Phytoplankton Tracking (MPT), which covers diverse background information and variations in motion during observation. The dataset includes 27 species of phytoplankton and zooplankton, 14 different backgrounds to simulate diverse and complex underwater environments, and a total of 140 videos. To enable accurate real-time observation of phytoplankton, we introduce a multi-object tracking method, Deviation-Corrected Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Tracker(DSFT), which addresses issues such as focus shifts during tracking and the loss of small target information when computing frame-to-frame similarity. Specifically, we introduce an additional feature extractor to predict the residuals of the standard feature extractor's output, and compute multi-scale frame-to-frame similarity based on features from different layers of the extractor. Extensive experiments on the MPT have demonstrated the validity of the dataset and the superiority of DSFT in tracking phytoplankton, providing an effective solution for phytoplankton monitoring.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit various biases and stereotypes in their generated content. While extensive research has investigated bias in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit bias, leaving the more nuanced implicit biases largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We propose a novel "self-reflection" based evaluation framework that operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases, where explicit biases manifest as mild stereotypes while implicit biases show strong stereotypes. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying factors contributing to this explicit-implicit bias inconsistency. Our experiments examine the effects of training data scale, model parameters, and alignment techniques. Results indicate that while explicit bias diminishes with increased training data and model size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Notably, contemporary alignment methods (e.g., RLHF, DPO) effectively suppress explicit bias but show limited efficacy in mitigating implicit bias. These findings suggest that while scaling up models and alignment training can address explicit bias, the challenge of implicit bias requires novel approaches beyond current methodologies.

> We apply artificial neural networks (ANNs) to nowcast quarterly GDP growth for the U.S. economy. Using the monthly FRED-MD database, we compare the nowcasting performance of five different ANN architectures: the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), the Elman recurrent neural network (RNN), the long short-term memory network (LSTM), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). The empirical analysis presents results from two distinctively different evaluation periods. The first (2012:Q1 -- 2019:Q4) is characterized by balanced economic growth, while the second (2012:Q1 -- 2024:Q2) also includes periods of the COVID-19 recession. During the first evaluation period, longer input sequences slightly improve nowcasting performance for some ANNs, but the best accuracy is still achieved with 8-month-long input sequences at the end of the nowcasting window. Results from the second test period depict the role of long-term memory even more clearly. The MLP, the 1D CNN, and the Elman RNN work best with 8-month-long input sequences at each step of the nowcasting window. The relatively weak performance of the gated RNNs also suggests that architectural features enabling long-term memory do not result in more accurate nowcasts for GDP growth. The combined results indicate that the 1D CNN seems to represent a \textit{``sweet spot''} between the simple time-agnostic MLP and the more complex (gated) RNNs. The network generates nearly as accurate nowcasts as the best competitor for the first test period, while it achieves the overall best accuracy during the second evaluation period. Consequently, as a first in the literature, we propose the application of the 1D CNN for economic nowcasting.

> Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) aim to sample from a target distribution by learning score functions using samples perturbed by Gaussian noise. Existing convergence bounds for SGMs in the $\mathcal{W}_2$-distance rely on stringent assumptions about the data distribution. In this work, we present a novel framework for analyzing $\mathcal{W}_2$-convergence in SGMs, significantly relaxing traditional assumptions such as log-concavity and score regularity. Leveraging the regularization properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we show that weak log-concavity of the data distribution evolves into log-concavity over time. This transition is rigorously quantified through a PDE-based analysis of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation governing the log-density of the forward process. Moreover, we establish that the drift of the time-reversed OU process alternates between contractive and non-contractive regimes, reflecting the dynamics of concavity. Our approach circumvents the need for stringent regularity conditions on the score function and its estimators, relying instead on milder, more practical assumptions. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this framework through explicit computations on Gaussian mixture models, illustrating its versatility and potential for broader classes of data distributions.

> Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness worldwide, caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina due to diabetes. Early detection and classification of DR are crucial for timely intervention and preventing vision loss. This work proposes an automated system for DR detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a residual block architecture, which enhances feature extraction and model performance. To further improve the model's robustness, we incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques, specifically leveraging a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating diverse retinal images. This approach increases the variability of training data, making the model more generalizable and capable of handling real-world variations in retinal images. The system is designed to classify retinal images into five distinct categories, from No DR to Proliferative DR, providing an efficient and scalable solution for early diagnosis and monitoring of DR progression. The proposed model aims to support healthcare professionals in large-scale DR screening, especially in resource-constrained settings.

> In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks (Dense NN) for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.

> Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized graph-structured data modeling, yet traditional GNNs struggle with complex heterogeneous structures prevalent in real-world scenarios. Despite progress in handling heterogeneous interactions, two fundamental challenges persist: noisy data significantly compromising embedding quality and learning performance, and existing methods' inability to capture intricate semantic transitions among heterogeneous relations, which impacts downstream predictions. To address these fundamental issues, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Diffusion Model (DiffGraph), a pioneering framework that introduces an innovative cross-view denoising strategy. This advanced approach transforms auxiliary heterogeneous data into target semantic spaces, enabling precise distillation of task-relevant information. At its core, DiffGraph features a sophisticated latent heterogeneous graph diffusion mechanism, implementing a novel forward and backward diffusion process for superior noise management. This methodology achieves simultaneous heterogeneous graph denoising and cross-type transition, while significantly simplifying graph generation through its latent-space diffusion capabilities. Through rigorous experimental validation on both public and industrial datasets, we demonstrate that DiffGraph consistently surpasses existing methods in link prediction and node classification tasks, establishing new benchmarks for robustness and efficiency in heterogeneous graph processing. The model implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/DiffGraph.

> In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.

> The spatial context of single-cell gene expression data is crucial for many downstream analyses, yet often remains inaccessible due to practical and technical limitations, restricting the utility of such datasets. In this paper, we propose a generic representation learning and transfer learning framework dp-VAE, capable of reconstructing the spatial coordinates associated with the provided gene expression data. Central to our approach is a distance-preserving regularizer integrated into the loss function during training, ensuring the model effectively captures and utilizes spatial context signals from reference datasets. During the inference stage, the produced latent representation of the model can be used to reconstruct or impute the spatial context of the provided gene expression by solving a constrained optimization problem. We also explore the theoretical connections between distance-preserving loss, distortion, and the bi-Lipschitz condition within generative models. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of dp-VAE in different tasks involving training robustness, out-of-sample evaluation, and transfer learning inference applications by testing it over 27 publicly available datasets. This underscores its applicability to a wide range of genomics studies that were previously hindered by the absence of spatial data.

> Understanding the causal interactions in simple brain tasks, such as face detection, remains a challenging and ambiguous process for researchers. In this study, we address this issue by employing a novel causal discovery method -- Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity (DAGMA) -- to investigate the causal structure of the brain's face-selective network and gain deeper insights into its mechanism. Using natural movie stimuli, we extract causal network of face-selective regions and analyze how frames containing faces influence this network. Our findings reveal that the presence of faces in the stimuli have causal effect both on the number and strength of causal connections within the network. Additionally, our results highlight the crucial role of subcortical regions in satisfying causal sufficiency, emphasizing its importance in causal studies of brain. This study provides a new perspective on understanding the causal architecture of the face-selective network of the brain, motivating further research on neural causality.

- `2501.02334v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02334v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02334v1)

> The rapid advancements in large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities are making their broad application in the high-stakes testing context more likely. Use of generative AI in the scoring of constructed responses is particularly appealing because it reduces the effort required for handcrafting features in traditional AI scoring and might even outperform those methods. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the differences in the feature-based and generative AI applications in constructed response scoring systems and propose a set of best practices for the collection of validity evidence to support the use and interpretation of constructed response scores from scoring systems using generative AI. We compare the validity evidence needed in scoring systems using human ratings, feature-based natural language processing AI scoring engines, and generative AI. The evidence needed in the generative AI context is more extensive than in the feature-based NLP scoring context because of the lack of transparency and other concerns unique to generative AI such as consistency. Constructed response score data from standardized tests demonstrate the collection of validity evidence for different types of scoring systems and highlights the numerous complexities and considerations when making a validity argument for these scores. In addition, we discuss how the evaluation of AI scores might include a consideration of how a contributory scoring approach combining multiple AI scores (from different sources) will cover more of the construct in the absence of human ratings.

> This bachelor's thesis examines the capabilities of ChatGPT 4 in code generation across 19 programming languages. The study analyzed solution rates across three difficulty levels, types of errors encountered, and code quality in terms of runtime and memory efficiency through a quantitative experiment. A total of 188 programming problems were selected from the LeetCode platform, and ChatGPT 4 was given three attempts to produce a correct solution with feedback. ChatGPT 4 successfully solved 39.67% of all tasks, with success rates decreasing significantly as problem complexity increased. Notably, the model faced considerable challenges with hard problems across all languages. ChatGPT 4 demonstrated higher competence in widely used languages, likely due to a larger volume and higher quality of training data. The solution rates also revealed a preference for languages with low abstraction levels and static typing. For popular languages, the most frequent error was "Wrong Answer," whereas for less popular languages, compiler and runtime errors prevailed, suggesting frequent misunderstandings and confusion regarding the structural characteristics of these languages. The model exhibited above-average runtime efficiency in all programming languages, showing a tendency toward statically typed and low-abstraction languages. Memory efficiency results varied significantly, with above-average performance in 14 languages and below-average performance in five languages. A slight preference for low-abstraction languages and a leaning toward dynamically typed languages in terms of memory efficiency were observed. Future research should include a larger number of tasks, iterations, and less popular languages. Additionally, ChatGPT 4's abilities in code interpretation and summarization, debugging, and the development of complex, practical code could be analyzed further.   ----   Diese Bachelorarbeit untersucht die F\"ahigkeiten von ChatGPT 4 zur Code-Generierung in 19 Programmiersprachen. Betrachtet wurden die L\"osungsraten zwischen drei Schwierigkeitsgraden, die aufgetretenen Fehlerarten und die Qualit\"at des Codes hinsichtlich der Laufzeit- und Speichereffizienz in einem quantitativen Experiment. Dabei wurden 188 Programmierprobleme der Plattform LeetCode entnommen, wobei ChatGPT 4 jeweils drei Versuche hatte, mittels Feedback eine korrekte L\"osung zu generieren. ChatGPT 4 l\"oste 39,67 % aller Aufgaben erfolgreich, wobei die Erfolgsrate mit zunehmendem Schwierigkeitsgrad deutlich abnahm und bei komplexen Problemen in allen Sprachen signifikante Schwierigkeiten auftraten. Das Modell zeigte eine h\"ohere Kompetenz in weit verbreiteten Sprachen, was wahrscheinlich auf eine gr\"o{\ss}ere Menge und h\"ohere Qualit\"at der Trainingsdaten zur\"uckzuf\"uhren ist. Bez\"uglich der L\"osungsraten zeigte das Modell zudem eine Pr\"aferenz f\"ur Sprachen mit niedrigem Abstraktionsniveau und statischer Typisierung. Bei Sprachen hoher Popularit\"at trat der Fehler Wrong Answer am h\"aufigsten auf, w\"ahrend bei weniger popul\"aren Sprachen Compiler- und Laufzeitfehler \"uberwogen, was auf h\"aufige Missverst\"andnisse und Verwechslungen bez\"uglich der spezifischen strukturellen Eigenschaften dieser Sprachen zur\"uckzuf\"uhren ist. ChatGPT 4 demonstrierte in allen Programmiersprachen eine \"uberdurchschnittliche Laufzeiteffizienz und tendierte diesbez\"uglich erneut zu statisch typisierten und niedrig abstrahierten Sprachen. Die Werte zur Speichereffizienz variierten erheblich, wobei in 14 Sprachen \"uberdurchschnittliche und in f\"unf Sprachen unterdurchschnittliche Werte erzielt wurden. Es zeigte sich diesbez\"uglich eine leichte Tendenz zugunsten von niedrig abstrahierten sowie eine Pr\"aferenz zu dynamisch typisierten Sprachen. Zuk\"unftige Forschung sollte eine h\"ohere Anzahl an Aufgaben, Iterationen und unpopul\"aren Sprachen einbeziehen. Dar\"uber hinaus k\"onnten die F\"ahigkeiten von ChatGPT 4 in der Code-Interpretation und -Zusammenfassung, im Debugging und in der Entwicklung komplexer, praxisbezogener Codes analysiert werden.

> AI-based structural design represents a transformative approach that addresses the inefficiencies inherent in traditional structural design practices. This paper innovates the existing AI-based design frameworks from four aspects and proposes Generative AIBIM: an intelligent design pipeline that integrates BIM and generative AI. First, the proposed pipeline not only broadens the application scope of BIM, which aligns with BIM's growing relevance in civil engineering, but also marks a significant supplement to previous methods that relied on CAD drawings. Second, a two-stage generation framework incorporating generative AI (TGAI), inspired by the human drawing process, is designed to simplify the complexity of the design problem. Third, for the AI model in TGAI, this paper pioneers to fuse physical conditions into diffusion models (DMs) to build a novel physics-based conditional diffusion model (PCDM). In contrast to conventional DMs, on the one hand, PCDM directly predicts shear wall drawings to focus on similarity, and on the other hand, PCDM effectively fuses cross-domain information, i.e., design drawings, timesteps, and physical conditions, by integrating well-designed attention modules. Additionally, a new evaluation system including objective and subjective measures is designed to evaluate models' performance, complementing the evaluation system in the traditional methods. The quantitative results demonstrate that PCDM significantly surpasses recent SOTA techniques across both measures. The qualitative results highlight PCDM's superior capabilities in generating high-perceptual-quality drawings adhering to essential design criteria. In addition, benefiting from the fusion of physical conditions, PCDM effectively supports diverse and creative designs tailored to building heights and seismic precautionary intensities, showcasing its unique generation and generalization abilities.

> We propose a holistic approach for deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) as function-calling agents within vehicles as edge devices, offering a more flexible and robust alternative to traditional rule-based systems. By leveraging SLMs, we simplify vehicle control mechanisms and enhance the user experience. Given the in-vehicle hardware constraints, we apply state-of-the-art model compression techniques, including structured pruning, healing, and quantization, ensuring that the model fits within the resource limitations while maintaining acceptable performance. Our work focuses on optimizing a representative SLM, Microsoft's Phi-3 mini, and outlines best practices for enabling embedded models, including compression, task-specific fine-tuning, and vehicle integration. We demonstrate that, despite significant reduction in model size which removes up to 2 billion parameters from the original model, our approach preserves the model's ability to handle complex in-vehicle tasks accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, by executing the model in a lightweight runtime environment, we achieve a generation speed of 11 tokens per second, making real-time, on-device inference feasible without hardware acceleration. Our results demonstrate the potential of SLMs to transform vehicle control systems, enabling more intuitive interactions between users and their vehicles for an enhanced driving experience.

- `2312.00502v6` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00502v6) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00502v6)

> Despite recent advancements in deep learning, its application in real-world medical settings, such as phonocardiogram (PCG) classification, remains limited. A significant barrier is the lack of high-quality annotated datasets, which hampers the development of robust, generalizable models that can perform well on newly collected, out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) contrastive learning, has shown promise in mitigating the issue of data scarcity by using unlabeled data to enhance model robustness. Even though SSL methods have been proposed and researched in other domains, works focusing on the impact of data augmentations on model robustness for PCG classification are limited. In particular, while augmentations are a key component in SSL, selecting the most suitable policy during training is highly challenging. Improper augmentations can lead to substantial performance degradation and even hinder a network's ability to learn meaningful representations. Addressing this gap, our research aims to explore and evaluate a wide range of audio-based augmentations and uncover combinations that enhance SSL model performance in PCG classification. We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis across multiple datasets, assessing the impact of various augmentations on model performance. Our findings reveal that depending on the training distribution, augmentation choice significantly influences model robustness, with fully-supervised models experiencing up to a 32\% drop in effectiveness when evaluated on unseen data, while SSL models demonstrate greater resilience, losing only 10\% or even improving in some cases. This study also highlights the most promising and appropriate augmentations for PCG signal processing, by calculating their effect size on training. These insights equip researchers with valuable guidelines for developing reliable models in PCG signal processing.

> The increasing reliance on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), particularly the Global Positioning System (GPS), underscores the urgent need to safeguard these technologies against malicious threats such as spoofing and jamming. As the backbone for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) across various applications including transportation, telecommunications, and emergency services GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference that poses significant risks. Spoofing attacks, which involve transmitting counterfeit GNSS signals to mislead receivers into calculating incorrect positions, can result in serious consequences, from navigational errors in civilian aviation to security breaches in military operations. Furthermore, the lack of inherent security measures within GNSS systems makes them attractive targets for adversaries. While GNSS/GPS jamming and spoofing systems consist of numerous components, the ability to distinguish authentic signals from malicious ones is essential for maintaining system integrity. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning provide promising avenues for enhancing detection and mitigation strategies against these threats. This paper addresses both spoofing and jamming by tackling real-world challenges through machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets related to spoofing and jamming detection using advanced algorithms, we achieved state of the art results. In the GNSS/GPS jamming detection task, we attained approximately 99% accuracy, improving performance by around 5% compared to previous studies. Additionally, we addressed a challenging tasks related to spoofing detection, yielding results that underscore the potential of machine learning and deep learning in this domain.

> In this work, we study the weighted empirical risk minimization (weighted ERM) schema, in which an additional data-dependent weight function is incorporated when the empirical risk function is being minimized. We show that under a general ``balanceable" Bernstein condition, one can design a weighted ERM estimator to achieve superior performance in certain sub-regions over the one obtained from standard ERM, and the superiority manifests itself through a data-dependent constant term in the error bound. These sub-regions correspond to large-margin ones in classification settings and low-variance ones in heteroscedastic regression settings, respectively. Our findings are supported by evidence from synthetic data experiments.

> The objective of privacy-preserving synthetic graph publishing is to safeguard individuals' privacy while retaining the utility of original data. Most existing methods focus on graph neural networks under differential privacy (DP), and yet two fundamental problems in generating synthetic graphs remain open. First, the current research often encounters high sensitivity due to the intricate relationships between nodes in a graph. Second, DP is usually achieved through advanced composition mechanisms that tend to converge prematurely when working with a small privacy budget. In this paper, inspired by the simplicity, effectiveness, and ease of analysis of PageRank, we design PrivDPR, a novel privacy-preserving deep PageRank for graph synthesis. In particular, we achieve DP by adding noise to the gradient for a specific weight during learning. Utilizing weight normalization as a bridge, we theoretically reveal that increasing the number of layers in PrivDPR can effectively mitigate the high sensitivity and privacy budget splitting. Through formal privacy analysis, we prove that the synthetic graph generated by PrivDPR satisfies node-level DP. Experiments on real-world graph datasets show that PrivDPR preserves high data utility across multiple graph structural properties.

> The proliferation of large language models has raised growing concerns about their misuse, particularly in cases where AI-generated text is falsely attributed to human authors. Machine-generated content detectors claim to effectively identify such text under various conditions and from any language model. This paper critically evaluates these claims by assessing several popular detectors (RADAR, Wild, T5Sentinel, Fast-DetectGPT, GPTID, LogRank, Binoculars) on a range of domains, datasets, and models that these detectors have not previously encountered. We employ various prompting strategies to simulate adversarial attacks, demonstrating that even moderate efforts can significantly evade detection. We emphasize the importance of the true positive rate at a specific false positive rate (TPR@FPR) metric and demonstrate that these detectors perform poorly in certain settings, with TPR@.01 as low as 0%. Our findings suggest that both trained and zero-shot detectors struggle to maintain high sensitivity while achieving a reasonable true positive rate.

> Feature attribution methods have become essential for explaining machine learning models. Many popular approaches, such as SHAP and Banzhaf values, are grounded in power indices from cooperative game theory, which measure the contribution of features to model predictions. This work studies the computational complexity of power indices beyond SHAP, addressing the conditions under which they can be computed efficiently. We identify a simple condition on power indices that ensures that computation is polynomially equivalent to evaluating expected values, extending known results for SHAP. We also introduce Bernoulli power indices, showing that their computation can be simplified to a constant number of expected value evaluations. Furthermore, we explore interaction power indices that quantify the importance of feature subsets, proving that their computation complexity mirrors that of individual features.

> Fruit flies are established model systems for studying olfactory learning as they will readily learn to associate odors with both electric shock or sugar rewards. The mechanisms of the insect brain apparently responsible for odor learning form a relatively shallow neuronal architecture. Olfactory inputs are received by the antennal lobe (AL) of the brain, which produces an encoding of each odor mixture across ~50 sub-units known as glomeruli. Each of these glomeruli then projects its component of this feature vector to several of ~2000 so-called Kenyon Cells (KCs) in a region of the brain known as the mushroom body (MB). Fly responses to odors are generated by small downstream neutrophils that decode the higher-order representation from the MB. Research has shown that there is no recognizable pattern in the glomeruli--KC connections (and thus the particular higher-order representations); they are akin to fingerprints--even isogenic flies have different projections. Leveraging insights from this architecture, we propose KCNet, a single-hidden-layer neural network that contains sparse, randomized, binary weights between the input layer and the hidden layer and analytically learned weights between the hidden layer and the output layer. Furthermore, we also propose a dynamic optimization algorithm that enables the KCNet to increase performance beyond its structural limits by searching for a more efficient set of inputs. For odorant-perception tasks that predict the perceptual properties of an odorant, we show that KCNet outperforms existing data-driven approaches, such as XGBoost. For image classification tasks, KCNet achieves reasonable performance on benchmark datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST) without any data-augmentation methods or convolutional layers and shows a particularly fast running time.

> Deep neural networks have attained remarkable success across diverse classification tasks. Recent empirical studies have shown that deep networks learn features that are linearly separable across classes. However, these findings often lack rigorous justifications, even under relatively simple settings. In this work, we address this gap by examining the linear separation capabilities of shallow nonlinear networks. Specifically, inspired by the low intrinsic dimensionality of image data, we model inputs as a union of low-dimensional subspaces (UoS) and demonstrate that a single nonlinear layer can transform such data into linearly separable sets. Theoretically, we show that this transformation occurs with high probability when using random weights and quadratic activations. Notably, we prove this can be achieved when the network width scales polynomially with the intrinsic dimension of the data rather than the ambient dimension. Experimental results corroborate these theoretical findings and demonstrate that similar linear separation properties hold in practical scenarios beyond our analytical scope. This work bridges the gap between empirical observations and theoretical understanding of the separation capacity of nonlinear networks, offering deeper insights into model interpretability and generalization.

> As an alternative approach for predicting complex dynamical systems where physics-based models are no longer reliable, reservoir computing (RC) has gained popularity. The hybrid approach is considered an interesting option for improving the prediction performance of RC. The idea is to combine a knowledge-based model (KBM) to support the fully data-driven RC prediction. There are three types of hybridization for RC, namely full hybrid (FH), input hybrid (IH) and output hybrid (OH), where it was shown that the latter one is superior in terms of the accuracy and the robustness for the prediction of low-dimensional chaotic systems. Here, we extend the formalism to the prediction of spatiotemporal patterns in two dimensions. To overcome the curse of dimensionality for this very high-dimensional case we employ the local states ansatz, where only a few locally adjacent time series are utilized for the RC-based prediction. Using simulation data from the Barkley model describing chaotic electrical wave propagation in cardiac tissue, we outline the formalism of high-dimensional hybrid RC and assess the performance of the different hybridization schemes. We find that all three methods (FH, IH and OH) perform better than reservoir only, where improvements are small when the model is very inaccurate. For small model errors and small reservoirs FH and OH perform nearly equally well and better than IH. Given the smaller CPU needs for OH and especially the better interpretability of it, OH is to be favored. For large reservoirs the performance of OH drops below that of FH and IH. Generally, it maybe advisable to test the three setups for a given application and select the best suited one that optimizes between the counteracting factors of prediction performance and CPU needs.

> Task arithmetic in large-scale pre-trained models enables flexible adaptation to diverse downstream tasks without extensive re-training. By leveraging task vectors (TVs), users can perform modular updates to pre-trained models through simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. However, this flexibility introduces new security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we identify and evaluate the susceptibility of TVs to backdoor attacks, demonstrating how malicious actors can exploit TVs to compromise model integrity. By developing composite backdoors and eliminating redudant clean tasks, we introduce BadTV, a novel backdoor attack specifically designed to remain effective under task learning, forgetting, and analogies operations. Our extensive experiments reveal that BadTV achieves near-perfect attack success rates across various scenarios, significantly impacting the security of models using task arithmetic. We also explore existing defenses, showing that current methods fail to detect or mitigate BadTV. Our findings highlight the need for robust defense mechanisms to secure TVs in real-world applications, especially as TV services become more popular in machine-learning ecosystems.

> \emph{Abrupt learning} is commonly observed in neural networks, where long plateaus in network performance are followed by rapid convergence to a desirable solution. Yet, despite its common occurrence, the complex interplay of task, network architecture, and learning rule has made it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms. Here, we introduce a minimal dynamical system trained on a delayed-activation task and demonstrate analytically how even a one-dimensional system can exhibit abrupt learning through ghost points rather than bifurcations. Through our toy model, we show that the emergence of a ghost point destabilizes learning dynamics. We identify a critical learning rate that prevents learning through two distinct loss landscape features: a no-learning zone and an oscillatory minimum. Testing these predictions in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we confirm that ghost points precede abrupt learning and accompany the destabilization of learning. We demonstrate two complementary remedies: lowering the model output confidence prevents the network from getting stuck in no-learning zones, while increasing trainable ranks beyond task requirements (\textit{i.e.}, adding sloppy parameters) provides more stable learning trajectories. Our model reveals a bifurcation-free mechanism for abrupt learning and illustrates the importance of both deliberate uncertainty and redundancy in stabilizing learning dynamics.

> We present Tensor-GaLore, a novel method for efficient training of neural networks with higher-order tensor weights. Many models, particularly those used in scientific computing, employ tensor-parameterized layers to capture complex, multidimensional relationships. When scaling these methods to high-resolution problems makes memory usage grow intractably, and matrix based optimization methods lead to suboptimal performance and compression. We propose to work directly in the high-order space of the complex tensor parameter space using a tensor factorization of the gradients during optimization. We showcase its effectiveness on Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), a class of models crucial for solving partial differential equations (PDE) and prove the theory of it. Across various PDE tasks like the Navier Stokes and Darcy Flow equations, Tensor-GaLore achieves substantial memory savings, reducing optimizer memory usage by up to 75%. These substantial memory savings across AI for science demonstrate Tensor-GaLore's potential.

> With the recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) driven by large language models (LLMs), many researchers have focused on models that comprised of an image encoder, an image-to-language projection layer, and a text decoder architectures, leading to the emergence of works like LLava-Med. However, these works primarily operate at the whole-image level, aligning general information from 2D medical images without attending to finer details. As a result, these models often provide irrelevant or non-clinically valuable information while missing critical details. Medical vision-language tasks differ significantly from general images, particularly in their focus on fine-grained details, while excluding irrelevant content. General domain VLMs tend to prioritize global information due to their design, which compresses the entire image into a multi-token representation that is passed into the LLM decoder. Therefore, current VLMs all lack the capability to restrict their attention to particular areas. To address this critical issue in the medical domain, we introduce MedVP, an visual prompt generation and fine-tuning framework, which involves extract medical entities, generate visual prompts, and adapt datasets for visual prompt guided fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly introduce visual prompt into medical VLMs, and we successfully outperform recent state-of-the-art large models across multiple medical VQA datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze the impact of different visual prompt forms and how they contribute to performance improvement. The results demonstrate both the effectiveness and clinical significance of our approach

> Tensor networks developed in the context of condensed matter physics try to approximate order-$N$ tensors with a reduced number of degrees of freedom that is only polynomial in $N$ and arranged as a network of partially contracted smaller tensors. As we have recently demonstrated in the context of quantum many-body physics, computation costs can be further substantially reduced by imposing constraints on the canonical polyadic (CP) rank of the tensors in such networks [arXiv:2205.15296]. Here, we demonstrate how tree tensor networks (TTN) with CP rank constraints and tensor dropout can be used in machine learning. The approach is found to outperform other tensor-network-based methods in Fashion-MNIST image classification. A low-rank TTN classifier with branching ratio $b=4$ reaches a test set accuracy of 90.3\% with low computation costs. Consisting of mostly linear elements, tensor network classifiers avoid the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. The CP rank constraints have additional advantages: The number of parameters can be decreased and tuned more freely to control overfitting, improve generalization properties, and reduce computation costs. They allow us to employ trees with large branching ratios, substantially improving the representation power.

> We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.

> Accurately predicting chronological age from DNA methylation patterns is crucial for advancing biological age estimation. However, this task is made challenging by Epigenetic Correlation Drift (ECD) and Heterogeneity Among CpGs (HAC), which reflect the dynamic relationship between methylation and age across different life stages. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-phase algorithm. The first phase employs similarity searching to cluster methylation profiles by age group, while the second phase uses Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM) for precise, group-specific prediction. Our method not only improves prediction accuracy but also reveals key age-related CpG sites, detects age-specific changes in aging rates, and identifies pairwise interactions between CpG sites. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional epigenetic clocks and machine learning models, offering a more accurate and interpretable solution for biological age estimation with significant implications for aging research.

> Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly difficult as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that the type I and type II errors for our tests decrease exponentially in the text length. In designing our tests, we derive concentration inequalities on the difference between log-perplexity and the average entropy of the string under $A$. Specifically, for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. Lastly, we present preliminary experimental results to support our theoretical results. By enabling guaranteed (with high probability) finding of the origin of harmful LLM-generated text with arbitrary size, we can help fight misinformation.

> Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revolutionized many fields, including healthcare. However, these advances raise significant privacy concerns, especially when models specialized on sensitive data can memorize and then expose and regurgitate confidential information. This paper presents a privacy-by-design language modeling approach to address the problem of language models anonymization, and thus promote their sharing. Specifically, we propose both a Masking Language Modeling (MLM) methodology to specialize a BERT-like language model, and a Causal Language Modeling (CLM) methodology to specialize a GPT-like model that avoids the model from memorizing direct and indirect identifying information present in the training data. We have comprehensively evaluated our approaches using medical datasets and compared them against different baselines. Our results indicate that by avoiding memorizing both direct and indirect identifiers during model specialization, our masking and causal language modeling schemes offer the best tradeoff for maintaining high privacy while retaining high utility.

> The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked many applications but also underscores the challenge of aligning them with diverse values and preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is central to alignment but constrained by fixed divergences and limited feature transformations. We propose DPO-Kernels, which integrates kernel methods to address these issues through four key contributions: (i) Kernelized Representations with polynomial, RBF, Mahalanobis, and spectral kernels for richer transformations, plus a hybrid loss combining embedding-based and probability-based objectives; (ii) Divergence Alternatives (Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, Renyi, Bhattacharyya, Wasserstein, and f-divergences) for greater stability; (iii) Data-Driven Selection metrics that automatically choose the best kernel-divergence pair; and (iv) a Hierarchical Mixture of Kernels for both local precision and global modeling. Evaluations on 12 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in factuality, safety, reasoning, and instruction following. Grounded in Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, DPO-Kernels maintains robust generalization for LLMs, offering a comprehensive resource for further alignment research.

> Missing data imputation is a critical challenge in various domains, such as healthcare and finance, where data completeness is vital for accurate analysis. Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating the risk of LLM hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a "forest" of few-shot learning LLM "trees" with confidence-based weighted voting, inspired by ensemble learning (Random Forest). This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-Forest.

> Generative models hold great potential, but only if one can trust the evaluation of the data they generate. We show that many commonly used quality scores for comparing two-dimensional distributions of synthetic vs. ground-truth data give better results than they should, a phenomenon we call the "grade inflation problem." We show that the correlation score, Jaccard score, earth-mover's score, and Kullback-Leibler (relative-entropy) score all suffer grade inflation. We propose that any score that values all datapoints equally, as these do, will also exhibit grade inflation; we refer to such scores as "equipoint" scores. We introduce the concept of "equidensity" scores, and present the Eden score, to our knowledge the first example of such a score. We found that Eden avoids grade inflation and agrees better with human perception of goodness-of-fit than the equipoint scores above. We propose that any reasonable equidensity score will avoid grade inflation. We identify a connection between equidensity scores and R\'enyi entropy of negative order. We conclude that equidensity scores are likely to outperform equipoint scores for generative models, and for comparing low-dimensional distributions more generally.

> Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Numerous methods have been proposed to infer a directed acyclic graph (DAG) corresponding to the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN) that captures causal gene relationships. However, existing models have restrictive assumptions (e.g. linearity, acyclicity), limited scalability, and/or fail to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.

> Environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion have prompted the need for renewable energy-based power generation. However, its stability is often challenged by low energy density and non-stationary conditions. Wave energy converters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height prediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can lead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we propose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with deep ensemble (DE) for robust uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To further enhance the reliability, uncertainty calibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality of the quantified uncertainty. Using real operational data from an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, the model achieves notable accuracy (R2 > 0.9), while increasing uncertainty quality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model hyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational scenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period. These results demonstrate the model's capability to deliver reliable predictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.

> Mean texture depth (MTD) is pivotal in assessing the skid resistance of asphalt pavements and ensuring road safety. This study focuses on developing an automated system for extracting texture features and evaluating MTD based on pavement images. The contributions of this work are threefold: firstly, it proposes an economical method to acquire three-dimensional (3D) pavement texture data; secondly, it enhances 3D image processing techniques and formulates features that represent various aspects of texture; thirdly, it establishes multivariate prediction models that link these features with MTD values. Validation results demonstrate that the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) model achieves remarkable prediction stability and accuracy (R2 = 0.9858), and field tests indicate the superiority of the proposed method over other techniques, with relative errors below 10%. This method offers a comprehensive end-to-end solution for pavement quality evaluation, from images input to MTD predictions output.

> Databases are increasingly embracing AI to provide autonomous system optimization and intelligent in-database analytics, aiming to relieve end-user burdens across various industry sectors.

> We address the problem of optimizing over functions defined on node subsets in a graph. The optimization of such functions is often a non-trivial task given their combinatorial, black-box and expensive-to-evaluate nature. Although various algorithms have been introduced in the literature, most are either task-specific or computationally inefficient and only utilize information about the graph structure without considering the characteristics of the function. To address these limitations, we utilize Bayesian Optimization (BO), a sample-efficient black-box solver, and propose a novel framework for combinatorial optimization on graphs. More specifically, we map each $k$-node subset in the original graph to a node in a new combinatorial graph and adopt a local modeling approach to efficiently traverse the latter graph by progressively sampling its subgraphs using a recursive algorithm. Extensive experiments under both synthetic and real-world setups demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BO framework on various types of graphs and optimization tasks, where its behavior is analyzed in detail with ablation studies.

> Low-precision training is considered an effective strategy for reducing both training and downstream inference costs. Previous scaling laws for precision mainly focus on integer quantization, which pay less attention to the constituents in floating-point quantization and thus cannot well fit the LLM losses in this scenario. In contrast, while floating-point quantization training is more commonly implemented in production, the research on it has been relatively superficial. In this paper, we thoroughly explore the effects of floating-point quantization targets, exponent bits, mantissa bits, and the calculation granularity of the scaling factor in floating-point quantization training performance of LLM models. While presenting an accurate floating-point quantization unified scaling law, we also provide valuable suggestions for the community: (1) Exponent bits contribute slightly more to the model performance than mantissa bits. We provide the optimal exponent-mantissa bit ratio for different bit numbers, which is available for future reference by hardware manufacturers; (2) We discover the formation of the critical data size in low-precision LLM training. Too much training data exceeding the critical data size will inversely bring in degradation of LLM performance; (3) The optimal floating-point quantization precision is directly proportional to the computational power, but within a wide computational power range, we estimate that the best cost-performance precision lies between 4-8 bits.

> Cognitive textual and visual reasoning tasks, including puzzles, series, and analogies, demand the ability to quickly reason, decipher, and evaluate patterns both textually and spatially. Due to extensive training on vast amounts of human-curated data, LLMs and VLMs excel in common-sense reasoning tasks, however still struggle with more complex reasoning that demands deeper cognitive understanding. We introduce NTSEBench, a new dataset designed to evaluate cognitive multi-modal reasoning and problem-solving skills of large models. The dataset contains 2728 multiple-choice questions, accompanied by a total of 4,642 images, categorized into 26 different types. These questions are drawn from the nationwide NTSE examination in India and feature a mix of visual and textual general aptitude challenges, designed to assess intelligence and critical thinking skills beyond mere rote learning. We establish baselines on the dataset using state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs. To facilitate a comparison between open source and propriety models, we propose four distinct modeling strategies to handle different modalities -- text and images -- in the dataset instances.

> Supervised fine-tuning has become the predominant method for adapting large pretrained models to downstream tasks. However, recent studies have revealed that these models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where even a small number of malicious samples can successfully embed backdoor triggers into the model. While most existing defense methods focus on post-training backdoor defense, efficiently defending against backdoor attacks during training phase remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel defense method called Backdoor Token Unlearning (BTU), which proactively detects and neutralizes trigger tokens during the training stage. Our work is based on two key findings: 1) backdoor learning causes distinctive differences between backdoor token parameters and clean token parameters in word embedding layers, and 2) the success of backdoor attacks heavily depends on backdoor token parameters. The BTU defense leverages these properties to identify aberrant embedding parameters and subsequently removes backdoor behaviors using a fine-grained unlearning technique. Extensive evaluations across three datasets and four types of backdoor attacks demonstrate that BTU effectively defends against these threats while preserving the model's performance on primary tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/XDJPH/BTU.

> With good explanatory power and controllability, rule-based methods play an important role in many tasks such as knowledge reasoning and decision support. However, existing studies primarily focused on learning chain-like rules, which limit their semantic expressions and accurate prediction abilities. As a result, chain-like rules usually fire on the incorrect grounding values, producing inaccurate or even erroneous reasoning results. In this paper, we propose the concept of tree-like rules on knowledge graphs to expand the application scope and improve the reasoning ability of rule-based methods. Meanwhile, we propose an effective framework for refining chain-like rules into tree-like rules. Experimental comparisons on four public datasets show that the proposed framework can easily adapt to other chain-like rule induction methods and the refined tree-like rules consistently achieve better performances than chain-like rules on link prediction. The data and code of this paper can be available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tree-rule-E3CD/.

> This paper presents a framework for deep transfer learning, which aims to leverage information from multi-domain upstream data with a large number of samples $n$ to a single-domain downstream task with a considerably smaller number of samples $m$, where $m \ll n$, in order to enhance performance on downstream task. Our framework offers several intriguing features. First, it allows the existence of both shared and domain-specific features across multi-domain data and provides a framework for automatic identification, achieving precise transfer and utilization of information. Second, the framework explicitly identifies upstream features that contribute to downstream tasks, establishing clear relationships between upstream domains and downstream tasks, thereby enhancing interpretability. Error analysis shows that our framework can significantly improve the convergence rate for learning Lipschitz functions in downstream supervised tasks, reducing it from $\tilde{O}(m^{-\frac{1}{2(d+2)}}+n^{-\frac{1}{2(d+2)}})$ ("no transfer") to $\tilde{O}(m^{-\frac{1}{2(d^*+3)}} + n^{-\frac{1}{2(d+2)}})$ ("partial transfer"), and even to $\tilde{O}(m^{-1/2}+n^{-\frac{1}{2(d+2)}})$ ("complete transfer"), where $d^* \ll d$ and $d$ is the dimension of the observed data. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical experiments on image classification and regression datasets.

These models, with their exceptional capacity for contextual comprehension, problem-solving, and task adaptability, present a transformative opportunity to reshape the future of smart cities and drive progress toward Urban General Intelligence (UGI). Despite increasing attention to Urban Foundation Models (UFMs), this rapidly evolving field faces critical challenges, including the lack of clear definitions, systematic reviews, and universalizable solutions. To address these issues, this paper first introduces the definition and concept of UFMs and highlights the distinctive challenges involved in their development. Furthermore, we present a data-centric taxonomy that classifies existing research on UFMs according to the various urban data modalities and types. In addition, we propose a prospective framework designed to facilitate the realization of versatile UFMs, aimed at overcoming the identified challenges and driving further progress in this field. Finally, this paper explores the wide-ranging applications of UFMs within urban contexts, illustrating their potential to significantly impact and transform urban systems.

- *Ruiquan Huang, Yingbin Liang, Jing Yang*

- `2411.07514v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07514v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07514v2)

> Distributionally robust offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find a policy that performs the best under the worst environment within an uncertainty set using an offline dataset collected from a nominal model. While recent advances in robust RL focus on Markov decision processes (MDPs), robust non-Markovian RL is limited to planning problem where the transitions in the uncertainty set are known. In this paper, we study the learning problem of robust offline non-Markovian RL. Specifically, when the nominal model admits a low-rank structure, we propose a new algorithm, featuring a novel dataset distillation and a lower confidence bound (LCB) design for robust values under different types of the uncertainty set. We also derive new dual forms for these robust values in non-Markovian RL, making our algorithm more amenable to practical implementation. By further introducing a novel type-I concentrability coefficient tailored for offline low-rank non-Markovian decision processes, we prove that our algorithm can find an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ offline samples. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to the case when the nominal model does not have specific structure. With a new type-II concentrability coefficient, the extended algorithm also enjoys polynomial sample efficiency under all different types of the uncertainty set.

<summary>2025-01-05 04:09:00 - An Empirical Study of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models During Continual Fine-tuning</summary>

- *Yun Luo, Zhen Yang, Fandong Meng, Yafu Li, Jie Zhou, Yue Zhang*

- `2308.08747v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08747v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08747v5)

> Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a phenomenon that occurs in machine learning when a model forgets previously learned information while acquiring new knowledge for achieving a satisfactory performance in downstream tasks. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, it is intriguing to investigate whether CF exists during the continual instruction tuning of LLMs. This study empirically evaluates the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs' knowledge during continual instruction tuning from the perspectives of domain knowledge, reasoning, and reading comprehension. The experiments reveal that catastrophic forgetting is generally observed in LLMs ranging from 1b to 7b parameters. Surprisingly, as the model scale increases, the severity of forgetting intensifies in such a model sale range which may result from the much significant initial performance in the larger LLM. Comparing the decoder-only model BLOOMZ with the encoder-decoder model mT0, BLOOMZ exhibits less forgetting and retains more knowledge. Interestingly, we also observe that LLMs can mitigate language biases, such as gender bias, during continual fine-tuning. Furthermore, our findings indicate that general instruction tuning can help alleviate the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs during subsequent fine-tuning.

> This paper introduces a recurrent neural network approach for predicting user lifetime value in Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. The approach accounts for three connected time dimensions. These dimensions are the user cohort (the date the user joined), user age-in-system (the time since the user joined the service) and the calendar date the user is an age-in-system (i.e., contemporaneous information).The recurrent neural networks use a multi-cell architecture, where each cell resembles a long short-term memory neural network. The approach is applied to predicting both acquisition (new users) and rolling (existing user) lifetime values for a variety of time horizons. It is found to significantly improve median absolute percent error versus light gradient boost models and Buy Until You Die models.

- `2501.02434v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02434v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02434v1)

> Metaphors play a crucial role in human communication, yet their comprehension remains a significant challenge for natural language processing (NLP) due to the cognitive complexity involved. According to Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), metaphors map a target domain onto a source domain, and understanding this mapping is essential for grasping the nature of metaphors. While existing NLP research has focused on tasks like metaphor detection and sentiment analysis of metaphorical expressions, there has been limited attention to the intricate process of identifying the mappings between source and target domains. Moreover, non-English multimodal metaphor resources remain largely neglected in the literature, hindering a deeper understanding of the key elements involved in metaphor interpretation. To address this gap, we developed a Chinese multimodal metaphor advertisement dataset (namely CM3D) that includes annotations of specific target and source domains. This dataset aims to foster further research into metaphor comprehension, particularly in non-English languages. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting-based Metaphor Mapping Identification Model (CPMMIM), which simulates the human cognitive process for identifying these mappings. Drawing inspiration from CoT reasoning and Bi-Level Optimization (BLO), we treat the task as a hierarchical identification problem, enabling more accurate and interpretable metaphor mapping. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CPMMIM, highlighting its potential for advancing metaphor comprehension in NLP. Our dataset and code are both publicly available to encourage further advancements in this field.

> Advancing artificial intelligence demands a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying deep learning. Here, we propose a straightforward analysis framework based on the dynamics of learning models. Neurons are categorized into two modes based on whether their transformation functions preserve order. This categorization reveals how deep neural networks (DNNs) maximize information extraction by rationally allocating the proportion of neurons in different modes across deep layers. We further introduce the attraction basins of the training samples in both the sample vector space and the weight vector space to characterize the generalization ability of DNNs. This framework allows us to identify optimal depth and width configurations, providing a unified explanation for fundamental DNN behaviors such as the "flat minima effect," "grokking," and double descent phenomena. Our analysis extends to networks with depths up to 100 layers.

> Recent work has shown the promise of learning with human feedback paradigms to produce human-determined high-quality text. Existing works use human feedback to train large language models (LLMs) in general domain abstractive summarization and have obtained summary quality exceeding traditional likelihood training. In this paper, we focus on a less explored form of human feedback -- Human Edits. We propose Sequence Alignment (un)Likelihood Training (SALT), a novel technique to use both the human-edited and model-generated data together in the training loop. In addition, we demonstrate simulating Human Edits with ground truth summaries coming from existing training data -- Imitation edits, along with the model-generated summaries obtained after the training, to reduce the need for expensive human-edit data. In our experiments, we extend human feedback exploration from general domain summarization to medical domain summarization. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SALT in improving the summary quality with Human and Imitation Edits. Through additional experiments, we show that SALT outperforms the conventional RLHF method (designed for human preferences) -- DPO, when applied to human-edit data. We hope the evidence in our paper prompts researchers to explore, collect, and better use different human feedback approaches scalably.

> Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained (or weak) devices presents significant challenges due to limited resources and heterogeneous data distribution. To address the data concern, it is necessary to fine-tune LLMs using on-device private data for various downstream tasks. While Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising privacy-preserving solution, existing fine-tuning methods retain the original LLM size, leaving issues of high inference latency and excessive memory demands unresolved. Hence, we design FedSpine, an FL framework that combines Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with structured pruning for efficient deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained devices. Specifically, FedSpine introduces an iterative process to prune and tune the parameters of LLMs. To mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity, an online Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithm is employed to adaptively determine different pruning ratios and LoRA ranks for heterogeneous devices without any prior knowledge of their computing and communication capabilities. As a result, FedSpine maintains higher inference accuracy while improving fine-tuning efficiency. Experimental results conducted on a physical platform with 80 devices demonstrate that FedSpine can speed up fine-tuning by 1.4$\times$-6.9$\times$ and improve final accuracy by 0.4%-4.5% under the same sparsity level compared to other baselines.

<summary>2025-01-05 04:42:03 - Concept Discovery in Deep Neural Networks for Explainable Face Anti-Spoofing</summary>

- *Haoyuan Zhang, Xiangyu Zhu, Li Gao, Guoying Zhao, Zhen Lei*

- `2412.17541v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17541v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17541v3)

> With the rapid growth usage of face recognition in people's daily life, face anti-spoofing becomes increasingly important to avoid malicious attacks. Recent face anti-spoofing models can reach a high classification accuracy on multiple datasets but these models can only tell people "this face is fake" while lacking the explanation to answer "why it is fake". Such a system undermines trustworthiness and causes user confusion, as it denies their requests without providing any explanations. In this paper, we incorporate XAI into face anti-spoofing and propose a new problem termed X-FAS (eXplainable Face Anti-Spoofing) empowering face anti-spoofing models to provide an explanation. We propose SPED (SPoofing Evidence Discovery), an X-FAS method which can discover spoof concepts and provide reliable explanations on the basis of discovered concepts. To evaluate the quality of X-FAS methods, we propose an X-FAS benchmark with annotated spoofing evidence by experts. We analyze SPED explanations on face anti-spoofing dataset and compare SPED quantitatively and qualitatively with previous XAI methods on proposed X-FAS benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate SPED's ability to generate reliable explanations.

- `2412.17522v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17522v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17522v2)

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating harmful content when prompted with carefully crafted inputs, a vulnerability known as LLM jailbreaking. As LLMs become more powerful, studying jailbreak methods is critical to enhancing security and aligning models with human values. Traditionally, jailbreak techniques have relied on suffix addition or prompt templates, but these methods suffer from limited attack diversity. This paper introduces DiffusionAttacker, an end-to-end generative approach for jailbreak rewriting inspired by diffusion models. Our method employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text diffusion model as a generator, conditioning on the original prompt and guiding the denoising process with a novel attack loss. Unlike previous approaches that use autoregressive LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts, which limit the modification of already generated tokens and restrict the rewriting space, DiffusionAttacker utilizes a seq2seq diffusion model, allowing more flexible token modifications. This approach preserves the semantic content of the original prompt while producing harmful content. Additionally, we leverage the Gumbel-Softmax technique to make the sampling process from the diffusion model's output distribution differentiable, eliminating the need for iterative token search. Extensive experiments on Advbench and Harmbench demonstrate that DiffusionAttacker outperforms previous methods across various evaluation metrics, including attack success rate (ASR), fluency, and diversity.

> This study investigates transformer model compression by systematically pruning its layers. We evaluated 14 pruning strategies across nine diverse datasets, including 12 strategies based on different signals obtained from layer activations, mutual information, gradients, weights, and attention. To address the limitations of single-signal strategies, we introduced two fusion strategies, linear regression and random forest, which combine individual strategies (i.e., strategic fusion), for more informed pruning decisions. Additionally, we applied knowledge distillation to mitigate any accuracy loss during layer pruning. Our results reveal that random forest strategic fusion outperforms individual strategies in seven out of nine datasets and achieves near-optimal performance in the other two. The distilled random forest surpasses the original accuracy in six datasets and mitigates accuracy drops in the remaining three. Knowledge distillation also improves the accuracy-to-size ratio by an average factor of 18.84 across all datasets. Supported by mathematical foundations and biological analogies, our findings suggest that strategically combining multiple signals can lead to efficient, high-performing transformer models for resource-constrained applications.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly gaining enormous popularity in recent years. However, the training of LLMs has raised significant privacy and legal concerns, particularly regarding the inclusion of copyrighted materials in their training data without proper attribution or licensing, which falls under the broader issue of data misappropriation. In this article, we focus on a specific problem of data misappropriation detection, namely, to determine whether a given LLM has incorporated data generated by another LLM. To address this issue, we propose embedding watermarks into the copyrighted training data and formulating the detection of data misappropriation as a hypothesis testing problem. We develop a general statistical testing framework, construct a pivotal statistic, determine the optimal rejection threshold, and explicitly control the type I and type II errors. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic optimality properties of the proposed tests, and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness through intensive numerical experiments.

> The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method.

> In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.

> This paper introduces a high-performance artificial intelligence operating system tailored for low-altitude aviation, designed to address key challenges such as real-time task execution, computational efficiency, and seamless modular collaboration. Built on a powerful hardware platform and leveraging the UNIX architecture, the system implements a distributed data processing strategy that ensures rapid and efficient synchronization across critical modules, including vision, navigation, and perception.

Complementing these core features are modular components for image analysis, multi-sensor fusion, dynamic path planning, multi-drone coordination, and ground station monitoring. Additionally, a low-code development platform simplifies user customization, making the system adaptable to various mission-specific needs. This comprehensive approach ensures the system meets the evolving demands of intelligent aviation, providing a stable, efficient, and secure environment for complex drone operations.

> Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) are widely used for high-quality image generation and medical image segmentation but often rely on Unet-based architectures, leading to high computational overhead, especially with high-resolution images. This work proposes three NCA-based improvements for diffusion-based medical image segmentation. First, Multi-MedSegDiffNCA uses a multilevel NCA framework to refine rough noise estimates generated by lower level NCA models. Second, CBAM-MedSegDiffNCA incorporates channel and spatial attention for improved segmentation. Third, MultiCBAM-MedSegDiffNCA combines these methods with a new RGB channel loss for semantic guidance. Evaluations on Lesion segmentation show that MultiCBAM-MedSegDiffNCA matches Unet-based model performance with dice score of 87.84% while using 60-110 times fewer parameters, offering a more efficient solution for low resource medical settings.

> Code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR) faces challenges due to the language confusion resulting from accents, auditory similarity, and seamless language switches. Adaptation on the pre-trained multi-lingual model has shown promising performance for CS-ASR. In this paper, we adapt Whisper, which is a large-scale multilingual pre-trained speech recognition model, to CS from both encoder and decoder parts. First, we propose an encoder refiner to enhance the encoder's capacity of intra-sentence swithching. Second, we propose using two sets of language-aware adapters with different language prompt embeddings to achieve language-specific decoding information in each decoder layer. Then, a fusion module is added to fuse the language-aware decoding. The experimental results using the SEAME dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, the proposed approach achieves a relative MER reduction of 4.1% and 7.2% on the dev_man and dev_sge test sets, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Through experiments, we found that the proposed method significantly improves the performance on non-native language in CS speech, indicating that our approach enables Whisper to better distinguish between the two languages.

> The preservation and revitalization of endangered and extinct languages is a meaningful endeavor, conserving cultural heritage while enriching fields like linguistics and anthropology. However, these languages are typically low-resource, making their reconstruction labor-intensive and costly. This challenge is exemplified by Nushu, a rare script historically used by Yao women in China for self-expression within a patriarchal society. To address this challenge, we introduce NushuRescue, an AI-driven framework designed to train large language models (LLMs) on endangered languages with minimal data. NushuRescue automates evaluation and expands target corpora to accelerate linguistic revitalization. As a foundational component, we developed NCGold, a 500-sentence Nushu-Chinese parallel corpus, the first publicly available dataset of its kind. Leveraging GPT-4-Turbo, with no prior exposure to Nushu and only 35 short examples from NCGold, NushuRescue achieved 48.69% translation accuracy on 50 withheld sentences and generated NCSilver, a set of 98 newly translated modern Chinese sentences of varying lengths. A sample of both NCGold and NCSilver is included in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we developed FastText-based and Seq2Seq models to further support research on Nushu. NushuRescue provides a versatile and scalable tool for the revitalization of endangered languages, minimizing the need for extensive human input.

> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks. However, despite their strong reasoning capabilities in high-resource languages (e.g., English and Chinese), a significant performance gap persists in other languages. To investigate this gap in Korean, we introduce HRM8K, a benchmark comprising 8,011 English-Korean parallel bilingual math problems. Through systematic analysis of model behaviors, we identify a key finding: these performance disparities stem primarily from difficulties in comprehending non-English inputs, rather than limitations in reasoning capabilities. Based on these findings, we propose UST (Understand, Solve, and Translate), a method that strategically uses English as an anchor for reasoning and solution generation. By fine-tuning the model on 130k synthetically generated data points, UST achieves a 10.91% improvement on the HRM8K benchmark and reduces the multilingual performance gap from 11.6% to 0.7%. Additionally, we show that improvements from UST generalize effectively to different Korean domains, demonstrating that capabilities acquired from machine-verifiable content can be generalized to other areas. We publicly release the benchmark, training dataset, and models.

> Contrastive learning, a prominent approach within self-supervised learning, has demonstrated significant effectiveness in developing generalizable models for various applications involving natural images. However, recent research indicates that these successes do not necessarily extend to the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we investigate the reasons for this suboptimal performance and hypothesize that the dense distribution of medical images poses challenges to the pretext tasks in contrastive learning, particularly in constructing positive and negative pairs. We explore model performance under different augmentation strategies and compare the results to those achieved with strong augmentations. Our study includes six publicly available datasets covering multiple clinically relevant tasks. We further assess the model's generalizability through external evaluations. The model pre-trained with weak augmentation outperforms those with strong augmentation, improving AUROC from 0.838 to 0.848 and AUPR from 0.523 to 0.597 on MESSIDOR2, and showing similar enhancements across other datasets. Our findings suggest that optimizing the scale of augmentation is critical for enhancing the efficacy of contrastive learning in medical imaging.

> The recent performance leap of Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new opportunities across numerous industrial applications and domains. However, erroneous generations, such as false predictions, misinformation, and hallucination made by LLMs, have also raised severe concerns for the trustworthiness of LLMs', especially in safety-, security- and reliability-sensitive scenarios, potentially hindering real-world adoptions. While uncertainty estimation has shown its potential for interpreting the prediction risks made by general machine learning (ML) models, little is known about whether and to what extent it can help explore an LLM's capabilities and counteract its undesired behavior. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we initiate an exploratory study on the risk assessment of LLMs from the lens of uncertainty. In particular, we experiment with twelve uncertainty estimation methods and four LLMs on four prominent natural language processing (NLP) tasks to investigate to what extent uncertainty estimation techniques could help characterize the prediction risks of LLMs. Our findings validate the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation for revealing LLMs' uncertain/non-factual predictions. In addition to general NLP tasks, we extensively conduct experiments with four LLMs for code generation on two datasets. We find that uncertainty estimation can potentially uncover buggy programs generated by LLMs. Insights from our study shed light on future design and development for reliable LLMs, facilitating further research toward enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs.

> There has been a growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code review thanks to their proven proficiency in code comprehension. The primary objective of most review scenarios is to generate desired review comments (DRCs) that explicitly identify issues to trigger code fixes. However, existing LLM-based solutions are not so effective in generating DRCs for various reasons such as hallucination. To enhance their code review ability, they need to be fine-tuned with a customized dataset that is ideally full of DRCs. Nevertheless, such a dataset is not yet available, while manual annotation of DRCs is too laborious to be practical. In this paper, we propose a dataset distillation method, Desiview, which can automatically construct a distilled dataset by identifying DRCs from a code review dataset. Experiments on the CodeReviewer dataset comprising more than 150K review entries show that Desiview achieves an impressive performance of 88.93%, 80.37%, 86.67%, and 84.44% in terms of Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. To validate the effect of such a distilled dataset on enhancing LLMs' code review ability, we first fine-tune the latest LLaMA series (i.e., LLaMA 3 and LLaMA 3.1) to build model Desiview4FT. We then enhance the model training effect through KTO alignment by feeding those review comments identified as non-DRCs to the LLMs, resulting in model Desiview4FA. Verification results indicate that Desiview4FA slightly outperforms Desiview4FT, while both models have significantly improved against the base models in terms of generating DRCs. Human evaluation confirms that both models identify issues more accurately and tend to generate review comments that better describe the issues contained in the code than the base LLMs do.

> Bilevel optimization reveals the inner structure of otherwise oblique optimization problems, such as hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture search, and meta-learning. A common goal in bilevel optimization is to minimize a hyper-objective that implicitly depends on the solution set of the lower-level function. Although this hyper-objective approach is widely used, its theoretical properties have not been thoroughly investigated in cases where the lower-level functions lack strong convexity. In this work, we first provide hardness results to show that the goal of finding stationary points of the hyper-objective for nonconvex-convex bilevel optimization can be intractable for zero-respecting algorithms. Then we study a class of tractable nonconvex-nonconvex bilevel problems when the lower-level function satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. We show a simple first-order algorithm can achieve better complexity bounds of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$, $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ in the deterministic, partially stochastic, and fully stochastic setting respectively. The complexities in the first two cases are optimal up to logarithmic factors.

> Ray tracing is widely employed to model the propagation of radio-frequency (RF) signal in complex environment. The modelling performance greatly depends on how accurately the target scene can be depicted, including the scene geometry and surface material properties. The advances in computer vision and LiDAR make scene geometry estimation increasingly accurate, but there still lacks scalable and efficient approaches to estimate the material reflectivity in real-world environment. In this work, we tackle this problem by learning the material reflectivity efficiently from the path loss of the RF signal from the transmitters to receivers. Specifically, we want the learned material reflection coefficients to minimize the gap between the predicted and measured powers of the receivers. We achieve this by translating the neural reflectance field from optics to RF domain by modelling both the amplitude and phase of RF signals to account for the multipath effects. We further propose a differentiable RF ray tracing framework that optimizes the neural reflectance field to match the signal strength measurements. We simulate a complex real-world environment for experiments and our simulation results show that the neural reflectance field can successfully learn the reflection coefficients for all incident angles. As a result, our approach achieves better accuracy in predicting the powers of receivers with significantly less training data compared to existing approaches.

> Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for addressing healthcare challenges but often generate hallucinations due to limited integration of medical knowledge. Incorporating external medical knowledge is therefore critical, especially considering the breadth and complexity of medical content, which necessitates effective multi-source knowledge acquisition. We address this challenge by framing it as a source planning problem, where the task is to formulate context-appropriate queries tailored to the attributes of diverse knowledge sources. Existing approaches either overlook source planning or fail to achieve it effectively due to misalignment between the model's expectation of the sources and their actual content. To bridge this gap, we present MedOmniKB, a comprehensive repository comprising multigenre and multi-structured medical knowledge sources. Leveraging these sources, we propose the Source Planning Optimisation (SPO) method, which enhances multi-source utilisation through explicit planning optimisation. Our approach involves enabling an expert model to explore and evaluate potential plans while training a smaller model to learn source alignment using positive and negative planning samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves multi-source planning performance, enabling the optimised small model to achieve state-of-the-art results in leveraging diverse medical knowledge sources.

> Remote sensing data is often distributed across multiple institutions, and due to privacy concerns and data-sharing restrictions, leveraging large-scale datasets in a centralized training framework is challenging. Federated learning offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across distributed data sources without requiring data centralization. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which typically contain billions of parameters, pose significant communication challenges for traditional federated learning approaches based on model parameter updates, as they would incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose FedRSCLIP, the first federated learning framework designed for remote sensing image classification based on a VLM, specifically CLIP. FedRSCLIP addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity and large-scale model transmission in federated environments by introducing Prompt Learning, which optimizes only a small set of tunable parameters. The framework introduces a dual-prompt mechanism, comprising Shared Prompts for global knowledge sharing and Private Prompts for client-specific adaptation. To maintain semantic coherence between shared and private prompts, we propose the Dual Prompt Alignment Constraint to balance global consistency and local adaptability across diverse client distributions. Additionally, to enhance cross-modal representation learning, we introduce the Cross-Modal Feature Alignment Constraint to align multimodal features between text and image prompts. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we construct a Fed-RSIC dataset based on three existing remote sensing image classification datasets, specifically designed to simulate various federated learning configurations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FedRSCLIP in remote sensing image classification.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, but the escalating demands on computational resources pose significant challenges, particularly in the extensive utilization of full fine-tuning for downstream tasks. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed, but they often underperform compared to full fine-tuning and struggle with memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce Gradient Weight-Normalized Low-Rank Projection (GradNormLoRP), a novel approach that enhances both parameter and memory efficiency while maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. GradNormLoRP normalizes the weight matrix to improve gradient conditioning, facilitating better convergence during optimization. Additionally, it applies low-rank approximations to the weight and gradient matrices, significantly reducing memory usage during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 8-bit GradNormLoRP reduces optimizer memory usage by up to 89.5% and enables the pre-training of large LLMs, such as LLaMA 7B, on consumer-level GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4090, without additional inference costs. Moreover, GradNormLoRP outperforms existing low-rank methods in fine-tuning tasks. For instance, when fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on all GLUE tasks with a rank of 8, GradNormLoRP achieves an average score of 80.65, surpassing LoRA's score of 79.23. These results underscore GradNormLoRP as a promising alternative for efficient LLM pre-training and fine-tuning.

> We present a novel method for diffusion-guided frameworks for view-consistent super-resolution (SR) in neural rendering. Our approach leverages existing 2D SR models in conjunction with advanced techniques such as Variational Score Distilling (VSD) and a LoRA fine-tuning helper, with spatial training to significantly boost the quality and consistency of upscaled 2D images compared to the previous methods in the literature, such as Renoised Score Distillation (RSD) proposed in DiSR-NeRF (1), or SDS proposed in DreamFusion. The VSD score facilitates precise fine-tuning of SR models, resulting in high-quality, view-consistent images. To address the common challenge of inconsistencies among independent SR 2D images, we integrate Iterative 3D Synchronization (I3DS) from the DiSR-NeRF framework. Our quantitative benchmarks and qualitative results on the LLFF dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our system compared to existing methods such as DiSR-NeRF.

> Inferring sky surface brightness distributions from noisy interferometric data in a principled statistical framework has been a key challenge in radio astronomy. In this work, we introduce Imaging for Radio Interferometry with Score-based models (IRIS). We use score-based models trained on optical images of galaxies as an expressive prior in combination with a Gaussian likelihood in the uv-space to infer images of protoplanetary disks from visibility data of the DSHARP survey conducted by ALMA. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework compared with traditional radio interferometry imaging algorithms, showing that it produces plausible posterior samples despite the use of a misspecified galaxy prior. Through coverage testing on simulations, we empirically evaluate the accuracy of this approach to generate calibrated posterior samples.

> Diffusion-based re-ranking is a common method used for retrieving instances by performing similarity propagation in a nearest neighbor graph. However, existing techniques that construct the affinity graph based on pairwise instances can lead to the propagation of misinformation from outliers and other manifolds, resulting in inaccurate results. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel Cluster-Aware Similarity (CAS) diffusion for instance retrieval. The primary concept of CAS is to conduct similarity diffusion within local clusters, which can reduce the influence from other manifolds explicitly. To obtain a symmetrical and smooth similarity matrix, our Bidirectional Similarity Diffusion strategy introduces an inverse constraint term to the optimization objective of local cluster diffusion. Additionally, we have optimized a Neighbor-guided Similarity Smoothing approach to ensure similarity consistency among the local neighbors of each instance. Evaluations in instance retrieval and object re-identification validate the effectiveness of the proposed CAS, our code is publicly available.

However, a universal method for designing IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based method, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a Gumbel-Softmax discretization constraint is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, resulting in channel-customized IDS-correcting codes with commendable performance across complex IDS channels.

> We focus on the challenging problem of learning an unbiased classifier from a large number of potentially relevant but noisily labeled web images given only a few clean labeled images. This problem is particularly practical because it reduces the expensive annotation costs by utilizing freely accessible web images with noisy labels. Typically, prototypes are representative images or features used to classify or identify other images. However, in the few clean and many noisy scenarios, the class prototype can be severely biased due to the presence of irrelevant noisy images. The resulting prototypes are less compact and discriminative, as previous methods do not take into account the diverse range of images in the noisy web image collections. On the other hand, the relation modeling between noisy and clean images is not learned for the class prototype generation in an end-to-end manner, which results in a suboptimal class prototype. In this article, we introduce a similarity maximization loss named SimNoiPro. Our SimNoiPro first generates noise-tolerant hybrid prototypes composed of clean and noise-tolerant prototypes and then pulls them closer to each other. Our approach considers the diversity of noisy images by explicit division and overcomes the optimization discrepancy issue. This enables better relation modeling between clean and noisy images and helps extract judicious information from the noisy image set. The evaluation results on two extended few-shot classification benchmarks confirm that our SimNoiPro outperforms prior methods in measuring image relations and cleaning noisy data.

- `2501.02477v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02477v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02477v1)

> This paper proposes a novel Deep Positive-Negative Prototype (DPNP) model that combines prototype-based learning (PbL) with discriminative methods to improve class compactness and separability in deep neural networks. While PbL traditionally emphasizes interpretability by classifying samples based on their similarity to representative prototypes, it struggles with creating optimal decision boundaries in complex scenarios. Conversely, discriminative methods effectively separate classes but often lack intuitive interpretability. Toward exploiting advantages of these two approaches, the suggested DPNP model bridges between them by unifying class prototypes with weight vectors, thereby establishing a structured latent space that enables accurate classification using interpretable prototypes alongside a properly learned feature representation. Based on this central idea of unified prototype-weight representation, Deep Positive Prototype (DPP) is formed in the latent space as a representative for each class using off-the-shelf deep networks as feature extractors. Then, rival neighboring class DPPs are treated as implicit negative prototypes with repulsive force in DPNP, which push away DPPs from each other. This helps to enhance inter-class separation without the need for any extra parameters. Hence, through a novel loss function that integrates cross-entropy, prototype alignment, and separation terms, DPNP achieves well-organized feature space geometry, maximizing intra-class compactness and inter-class margins. We show that DPNP can organize prototypes in nearly regular positions within feature space, such that it is possible to achieve competitive classification accuracy even in much lower-dimensional feature spaces. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that DPNP outperforms state-of-the-art models, while using smaller networks.

> In the information era, how learners find, evaluate, and effectively use information has become a challenging issue, especially with the added complexity of large language models (LLMs) that have further confused learners in their information retrieval and search activities. This study attempts to unpack this complexity by combining exploratory search strategies with the theories of exploratory learning to form a new theoretical model of exploratory learning from the perspective of students' learning. Our work adapts Kolb's learning model by incorporating high-frequency exploration and feedback loops, aiming to promote deep cognitive and higher-order cognitive skill development in students. Additionally, this paper discusses and suggests how advanced LLMs integrated into information retrieval and information theory can support students in their exploratory searches, contributing theoretically to promoting student-computer interaction and supporting their learning journeys in the new era with LLMs.

> Faces and humans are crucial elements in social interaction and are widely included in everyday photos and videos. Therefore, a deep understanding of faces and humans will enable multi-modal assistants to achieve improved response quality and broadened application scope. Currently, the multi-modal assistant community lacks a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of face and human understanding abilities. In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical ability taxonomy that includes three levels of abilities. Then, based on this taxonomy, we collect images and annotations from publicly available datasets in the face and human community and build a semi-automatic data pipeline to produce problems for the new benchmark. Finally, the obtained Face-Human-Bench comprises a development set with 900 problems and a test set with 1800 problems, supporting both English and Chinese. We conduct evaluations over 25 mainstream multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with our Face-Human-Bench, focusing on the correlation between abilities, the impact of the relative position of targets on performance, and the impact of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on performance. Moreover, inspired by multi-modal agents, we also explore which abilities of MLLMs need to be supplemented by specialist models.

> Humans rely on high-level meta-representations to engage in abstract reasoning. In complex cognitive tasks, these meta-representations help individuals abstract general rules from experience. However, constructing such meta-representations from high-dimensional observations remains a longstanding challenge for reinforcement learning agents. For instance, a well-trained agent often fails to generalize to even minor variations of the same task, such as changes in background color, while humans can easily handle. In this paper, we build a bridge between meta-representation and generalization, showing that generalization performance benefits from meta-representation learning. We also hypothesize that deep mutual learning (DML) among agents can help them converge to meta-representations. Empirical results provide support for our theory and hypothesis. Overall, this work provides a new perspective on the generalization of deep reinforcement learning.

> We investigate the problem of supporting Industrial Internet of Things user equipment (IIoT UEs) with intent (i.e., requested quality of service (QoS)) and random traffic arrival. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based centralized dynamic scheduler for time-frequency resources is proposed to learn how to schedule the available communication resources among the IIoT UEs. The proposed scheduler leverages an RL framework to adapt to the dynamic changes in the wireless communication system and traffic arrivals. Moreover, a graph-based reduction scheme is proposed to reduce the state and action space of the RL framework to allow fast convergence and a better learning strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent scheduler in guaranteeing the expressed intent of IIoT UEs compared to several traditional scheduling schemes, such as round-robin, semi-static, and heuristic approaches. The proposed scheduler also outperforms the contention-free and contention-based schemes in maximizing the number of successfully computed tasks.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at a wide range of tasks, but adapting them to new data, particularly for personalized applications, poses significant challenges due to resource and computational constraints. Existing methods either rely on exposing fresh data to the model through the prompt, which is limited by context size and computationally expensive at inference time, or fine-tuning, which incurs substantial training and update costs. In this paper, we introduce ComMer - Compress and Merge - a novel framework that efficiently personalizes LLMs by compressing users' documents into compact representations, which are then merged and fed into a frozen LLM. We evaluate ComMer on two types of personalization tasks - personalized skill learning, using the tweet paraphrasing dataset and the personalized news headline generation dataset from the LaMP benchmark, and knowledge-intensive, using the PerLTQA dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that in constrained inference budget scenarios ComMer achieves superior quality in skill learning tasks, while highlighting limitations in knowledge-intensive settings due to the loss of detailed information. These results offer insights into trade-offs and potential optimizations in multi-document compression for personalization.

The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.

> The remarkable performance of the o1 model in complex reasoning demonstrates that test-time computing scaling can further unlock the model's potential, enabling powerful System-2 thinking. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive surveys for test-time computing scaling. We trace the concept of test-time computing back to System-1 models. In System-1 models, test-time computing addresses distribution shifts and improves robustness and generalization through parameter updating, input modification, representation editing, and output calibration. In System-2 models, it enhances the model's reasoning ability to solve complex problems through repeated sampling, self-correction, and tree search. We organize this survey according to the trend of System-1 to System-2 thinking, highlighting the key role of test-time computing in the transition from System-1 models to weak System-2 models, and then to strong System-2 models. We also point out a few possible future directions.

> The goal of video moment retrieval and highlight detection is to identify specific segments and highlights based on a given text query. With the rapid growth of video content and the overlap between these tasks, recent works have addressed both simultaneously. However, they still struggle to fully capture the overall video context, making it challenging to determine which words are most relevant. In this paper, we present a novel Video Context-aware Keyword Attention module that overcomes this limitation by capturing keyword variation within the context of the entire video. To achieve this, we introduce a video context clustering module that provides concise representations of the overall video context, thereby enhancing the understanding of keyword dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a keyword weight detection module with keyword-aware contrastive learning that incorporates keyword information to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and textual features. Extensive experiments on the QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance in moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks compared to existing approaches.

> We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning (COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.

> Federated Learning is a privacy preserving decentralized machine learning paradigm designed to collaboratively train models across multiple clients by exchanging gradients to the server and keeping private data local. Nevertheless, recent research has revealed that the security of Federated Learning is compromised, as private ground truth data can be recovered through a gradient inversion technique known as Deep Leakage. While these attacks are crafted with a focus on applications in Federated Learning, they generally are not evaluated in realistic scenarios. This paper introduces the FEDLAD Framework (Federated Evaluation of Deep Leakage Attacks and Defenses), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses within a realistic Federated context. By implementing a unified benchmark that encompasses multiple state-of-the-art Deep Leakage techniques and various defense strategies, our framework facilitates the evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of these methods across different datasets and training states. This work highlights a crucial trade-off between privacy and model accuracy in Federated Learning and aims to advance the understanding of security challenges in decentralized machine learning systems, stimulate future research, and enhance reproducibility in evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses.

> For many practical applications, a high computational cost of inference over deep network architectures might be unacceptable. A small degradation in the overall inference accuracy might be a reasonable price to pay for a significant reduction in the required computational resources. In this work, we describe a method for introducing "shortcuts" into the DNN feedforward inference process by skipping costly feedforward computations whenever possible. The proposed method is based on the previously described BranchyNet (Teerapittayanon et al., 2016) and the EEnet (Demir, 2019) architectures that jointly train the main network and early exit branches. We extend those methods by attaching branches to pre-trained models and, thus, eliminating the need to alter the original weights of the network. We also suggest a new branch architecture based on convolutional building blocks to allow enough training capacity when applied on large DNNs. The proposed architecture includes confidence heads that are used for predicting the confidence level in the corresponding early exits. By defining adjusted thresholds on these confidence extensions, we can control in real-time the amount of data exiting from each branch and the overall tradeoff between speed and accuracy of our model. In our experiments, we evaluate our method using image datasets (SVHN and CIFAR10) and several DNN architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, VGG) with varied depth. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables us to reduce the average inference computational cost and further controlling the tradeoff between the model accuracy and the computation cost.

> In recent years, there has been a notable increase in research on machine learning models for music retrieval and generation systems that are capable of taking natural language sentences as inputs. However, there is a scarcity of large-scale publicly available datasets, consisting of music data and their corresponding natural language descriptions known as music captions. In particular, non-musical information such as suitable situations for listening to a track and the emotions elicited upon listening is crucial for describing music. This type of information is underrepresented in existing music caption datasets due to the challenges associated with extracting it directly from music data. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating music caption data that incorporates non-musical aspects inferred from music thumbnail images, and validated the effectiveness of our approach through human evaluations. Additionally, we created a dataset with approximately 360,000 captions containing non-musical aspects. Leveraging this dataset, we trained a music retrieval model and demonstrated its effectiveness in music retrieval tasks through evaluation.

> While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to generate reward signals for training embodied agents to follow instructions, our research reveals that agents guided by VLM rewards often underperform compared to those employing only intrinsic (exploration-driven) rewards, contradicting expectations set by recent work. We hypothesize that false positive rewards -- instances where unintended trajectories are incorrectly rewarded -- are more detrimental than false negatives. Our analysis confirms this hypothesis, revealing that the widely used cosine similarity metric is prone to false positive reward estimates. To address this, we introduce BiMI ({Bi}nary {M}utual {I}nformation), a novel reward function designed to mitigate noise. BiMI significantly enhances learning efficiency across diverse and challenging embodied navigation environments. Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of how different types of reward noise impact agent learning and highlight the importance of addressing multimodal reward signal noise when training embodied agents

> A broad range of technologies rely on remote inference, wherein data acquired is conveyed over a communication channel for inference in a remote server. Communication between the participating entities is often carried out over rate-limited channels, necessitating data compression for reducing latency. While deep learning facilitates joint design of the compression mapping along with encoding and inference rules, existing learned compression mechanisms are static, and struggle in adapting their resolution to changes in channel conditions and to dynamic links. To address this, we propose Adaptive Rate Task-Oriented Vector Quantization (ARTOVeQ), a learned compression mechanism that is tailored for remote inference over dynamic links. ARTOVeQ is based on designing nested codebooks along with a learning algorithm employing progressive learning. We show that ARTOVeQ extends to support low-latency inference that is gradually refined via successive refinement principles, and that it enables the simultaneous usage of multiple resolutions when conveying high-dimensional data. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme yields remote deep inference that operates with multiple rates, supports a broad range of bit budgets, and facilitates rapid inference that gradually improves with more bits exchanged, while approaching the performance of single-rate deep quantization methods.

> Facial images have extensive practical applications. Although the current large-scale text-image diffusion models exhibit strong generation capabilities, it is challenging to generate the desired facial images using only text prompt. Image prompts are a logical choice. However, current methods of this type generally focus on general domain. In this paper, we aim to optimize image makeup techniques to generate the desired facial images. Specifically, (1) we built a dataset of 4 million high-quality face image-text pairs (FaceCaptionHQ-4M) based on LAION-Face to train our Face-MakeUp model; (2) to maintain consistency with the reference facial image, we extract/learn multi-scale content features and pose features for the facial image, integrating these into the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of facial identity features for diffusion models. Validation on two face-related test datasets demonstrates that our Face-MakeUp can achieve the best comprehensive performance.All codes are available at:https://github.com/ddw2AIGROUP2CQUPT/Face-MakeUp

However, current molecular diffusion models are tailored towards a specific downstream task and lack adaptability. We introduce UniGuide, a framework for controlled geometric guidance of unconditional diffusion models that allows flexible conditioning during inference without the requirement of extra training or networks. We show how applications such as structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design are formulated in the UniGuide framework and demonstrate on-par or superior performance compared to specialised models. Offering a more versatile approach, UniGuide has the potential to streamline the development of molecular generative models, allowing them to be readily used in diverse application scenarios.

This paper explores the application of this approach in creating lifelike chatbot interactions within the context of Honkai: Star Rail, showcasing the potential for dynamic event-based systems to transform role-playing and interactive dialogue.

> The utilization of speech Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models achieves impressive performance on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, in low-resource language ASR, they encounter the domain mismatch problem between pre-trained and low-resource languages. Typical solutions like fine-tuning the SSL model suffer from high computation costs while using frozen SSL models as feature extractors comes with poor performance. To handle these issues, we extend a conventional efficient fine-tuning scheme based on the adapter. We add an extra intermediate adaptation to warm up the adapter and downstream model initialization. Remarkably, we update only 1-5% of the total model parameters to achieve the adaptation. Experimental results on the ML-SUPERB dataset show that our solution outperforms conventional efficient fine-tuning. It achieves up to a 28% relative improvement in the Character/Phoneme error rate when adapting to unseen languages.

> In this paper, we present NECHO v2, a novel framework designed to enhance the predictive accuracy of multimodal sequential patient diagnoses under uncertain missing visit sequences, a common challenge in real clinical settings. Firstly, we modify NECHO, designed in a diagnosis code-centric fashion, to handle uncertain modality representation dominance under the imperfect data. Secondly, we develop a systematic knowledge distillation by employing the modified NECHO as both teacher and student. It encompasses a modality-wise contrastive and hierarchical distillation, transformer representation random distillation, along with other distillations to align representations between teacher and student tightly and effectively. We also propose curriculum learning guided random data erasing within sequences during both training and distillation of the teacher to lightly simulate scenario with missing visit information, thereby fostering effective knowledge transfer. As a result, NECHO v2 verifies itself by showing robust superiority in multimodal sequential diagnosis prediction under both balanced and imbalanced incomplete settings on multimodal healthcare data.

> Transformers have achieved significant success in various fields, notably excelling in tasks involving sequential data like natural language processing. Despite these achievements, the theoretical understanding of transformers' capabilities remains limited. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical capabilities of transformers to autoregressively generate sequences in Bayesian networks based on in-context maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Specifically, we consider a setting where a context is formed by a set of independent sequences generated according to a Bayesian network. We demonstrate that there exists a simple transformer model that can (i) estimate the conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network according to the context, and (ii) autoregressively generate a new sample according to the Bayesian network with estimated conditional probabilities. We further demonstrate in extensive experiments that such a transformer does not only exist in theory, but can also be effectively obtained through training. Our analysis highlights the potential of transformers to learn complex probabilistic models and contributes to a better understanding of large language models as a powerful class of sequence generators.

> Traffic signal control (TSC) is an important and widely studied direction. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been used to solve TSC problems and achieve superior performance over conventional TSC methods. However, applying RL methods to the real world is challenging due to the huge cost of experiments in real-world traffic environments. One possible solution is TSC domain adaptation, which adapts trained models to target environments and reduces the number of interactions and the training cost. However, existing TSC domain adaptation methods still face two major issues: the lack of consideration for differences across cities and the low utilization of multi-city data.   To solve aforementioned issues, we propose an approach named Adaptive Modularized Model (AMM). By modularizing TSC problems and network models, we overcome the challenge of possible changes in environmental observations. We also aggregate multi-city experience through meta-learning. We conduct extensive experiments on different cities and show that AMM can achieve excellent performance with limited interactions in target environments and outperform existing methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility and generalizability of our method.

> Scientific figure captioning is a complex task that requires generating contextually appropriate descriptions of visual content. However, existing methods often fall short by utilizing incomplete information, treating the task solely as either an image-to-text or text summarization problem. This limitation hinders the generation of high-quality captions that fully capture the necessary details. Moreover, existing data sourced from arXiv papers contain low-quality captions, posing significant challenges for training large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a framework called Multi-LLM Collaborative Figure Caption Generation (MLBCAP) to address these challenges by leveraging specialized LLMs for distinct sub-tasks. Our approach unfolds in three key modules: (Quality Assessment) We utilize multimodal LLMs to assess the quality of training data, enabling the filtration of low-quality captions. (Diverse Caption Generation) We then employ a strategy of fine-tuning/prompting multiple LLMs on the captioning task to generate candidate captions. (Judgment) Lastly, we prompt a prominent LLM to select the highest quality caption from the candidates, followed by refining any remaining inaccuracies. Human evaluations demonstrate that informative captions produced by our approach rank better than human-written captions, highlighting its effectiveness.

> Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

> Medical image segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging analysis. Traditional CNN-based methods struggle with modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based models, despite their success, suffer from quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose KM-UNet, a novel U-shaped network architecture that combines the strengths of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and state-space models (SSMs). KM-UNet leverages the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for efficient feature representation and SSMs for scalable long-range modeling, achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate KM-UNet on five benchmark datasets: ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC, BUSI, and GLAS. Experimental results demonstrate that KM-UNet achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in medical image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, KM-UNet is the first medical image segmentation framework integrating KANs and SSMs. This work provides a valuable baseline and new insights for the development of more efficient and interpretable medical image segmentation systems.

> Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, has seen a steady increase in incidence rates worldwide, posing a significant challenge to dermatologists. Early detection is crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, performing total body screening (TBS), i.e., identifying suspicious lesions or ugly ducklings (UDs) by visual inspection, can be challenging and often requires sound expertise in pigmented lesions. To assist users of varying expertise levels, an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support tool was developed. Our solution identifies and characterizes UDs from real-world wide-field patient images. It employs a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm to locate and isolate all skin lesions present in a patient's total body images. These lesions are then sorted based on their level of suspiciousness using a self-supervised AI approach, tailored to the specific context of the patient under examination. A clinical validation study was conducted to evaluate the tool's performance. The results demonstrated an average sensitivity of 95% for the top-10 AI-identified UDs on skin lesions selected by the majority of experts in pigmented skin lesions. The study also found that the tool increased dermatologists' confidence when formulating a diagnosis, and the average majority agreement with the top-10 AI-identified UDs reached 100% when assisted by our tool. With the development of this AI-based decision support tool, we aim to address the shortage of specialists, enable faster consultation times for patients, and demonstrate the impact and usability of AI-assisted screening. Future developments will include expanding the dataset to include histologically confirmed melanoma and validating the tool for additional body regions.

- *Xinyu Yang, Yu Sun, Xinyang Chen, Ying Zhang, Xiaojie Yuan*

- `2412.18535v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18535v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18535v2)

> Spatial-temporal data collected across different geographic locations often suffer from missing values, posing challenges to data analysis. Existing methods primarily leverage fixed spatial graphs to impute missing values, which implicitly assume that the spatial relationship is roughly the same for all features across different locations. However, they may overlook the different spatial relationships of diverse features recorded by sensors in different locations. To address this, we introduce the multi-scale Graph Structure Learning framework for spatial-temporal Imputation (GSLI) that dynamically adapts to the heterogeneous spatial correlations. Our framework encompasses node-scale graph structure learning to cater to the distinct global spatial correlations of different features, and feature-scale graph structure learning to unveil common spatial correlation across features within all stations. Integrated with prominence modeling, our framework emphasizes nodes and features with greater significance in the imputation process. Furthermore, GSLI incorporates cross-feature and cross-temporal representation learning to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. Evaluated on six real incomplete spatial-temporal datasets, GSLI showcases the improvement in data imputation.

- *Chenyu Huang, Zhengyang Tang, Shixi Hu, Ruoqing Jiang, Xin Zheng, Dongdong Ge, Benyou Wang, Zizhuo Wang*

- `2405.17743v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17743v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17743v4)

> Optimization modeling plays a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate such task. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling and developing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we introduce OR-Instruct, a semi-automated data synthesis framework for optimization modeling that enables customizable enhancements for specific scenarios or model types. We also introduce IndustryOR, the first industrial benchmark for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. We train several 7B-scale open-source LLMs using synthesized data (dubbed ORLMs{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/ORLM}), which exhibit significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Additionally, our experiments highlight the potential of scaling law and reinforcement learning to further enhance the performance of ORLMs. The workflows and human-machine interaction paradigms of ORLMs in practical industrial applications are also discussed in the paper.

> Multi-view clustering (MvC) aims to integrate information from different views to enhance the capability of the model in capturing the underlying data structures. The widely used joint training paradigm in MvC is potentially not fully leverage the multi-view information, since the imbalanced and under-optimized view-specific features caused by the uniform learning objective for all views. For instance, particular views with more discriminative information could dominate the learning process in the joint training paradigm, leading to other views being under-optimized. To alleviate this issue, we first analyze the imbalanced phenomenon in the joint-training paradigm of multi-view clustering from the perspective of gradient descent for each view-specific feature extractor. Then, we propose a novel balanced multi-view clustering (BMvC) method, which introduces a view-specific contrastive regularization (VCR) to modulate the optimization of each view. Concretely, VCR preserves the sample similarities captured from the joint features and view-specific ones into the clustering distributions corresponding to view-specific features to enhance the learning process of view-specific feature extractors. Additionally, a theoretical analysis is provided to illustrate that VCR adaptively modulates the magnitudes of gradients for updating the parameters of view-specific feature extractors to achieve a balanced multi-view learning procedure. In such a manner, BMvC achieves a better trade-off between the exploitation of view-specific patterns and the exploration of view-invariance patterns to fully learn the multi-view information for the clustering task. Finally, a set of experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art approaches both on eight benchmark MvC datasets and two spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets.

> Graph condensation reduces the size of large graphs while preserving performance, addressing the scalability challenges of Graph Neural Networks caused by computational inefficiencies on large datasets. Existing methods often rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and limiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient approach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the condensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution of predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and resource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the capability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we derive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural information. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input nodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the representation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the challenge of optimizing binary structural information in condensed graphs, Concrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency matrix in a continuous counterpart. This relaxation process allows the adjacency matrix to be represented in a differentiable form, enabling the application of gradient-based optimization techniques to discrete graph structures. Experimental results show that the proposed GCGP method efficiently condenses large-scale graph data while preserving predictive performance, addressing the scalability and efficiency challenges. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/GCGP.

> Code vulnerability detection (CVD) is essential for addressing and preventing system security issues, playing a crucial role in ensuring software security. Previous learning-based vulnerability detection methods rely on either fine-tuning medium-size sequence models or training smaller neural networks from scratch. Recent advancements in large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in various code intelligence tasks including code understanding and generation. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting code vulnerabilities is largely under-explored. This work aims to investigate the gap by fine-tuning LLMs for the CVD task, involving four widely-used open-source LLMs. We also implement other five previous graph-based or medium-size sequence models for comparison. Experiments are conducted on five commonly-used CVD datasets, including both the part of short samples and long samples. In addition, we conduct quantitative experiments to investigate the class imbalance issue and the model's performance on samples of different lengths, which are rarely studied in previous works. To better facilitate communities, we open-source all codes and resources of this study in https://github.com/SakiRinn/LLM4CVD and https://huggingface.co/datasets/xuefen/VulResource.

> Extended reality (XR), blending virtual and real worlds, is a key application of future networks. While AI advancements enhance XR capabilities, they also impose significant computational and energy challenges on lightweight XR devices. In this paper, we developed a distributed queue model for multi-task DNN inference, addressing issues of resource competition and queue coupling. In response to the challenges posed by the high energy consumption and limited resources of XR devices, we designed a dual time-scale joint optimization strategy for model partitioning and resource allocation, formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. This strategy aims to minimize the total energy consumption of XR devices while ensuring queue stability and adhering to computational and communication resource constraints. To tackle this problem, we devised a Lyapunov-guided Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, named LyaPPO. Numerical results demonstrate that the LyaPPO algorithm outperforms the baselines, achieving energy conservation of 24.79% to 46.14% under varying resource capacities. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumption of XR devices by 24.29% to 56.62% compared to baseline algorithms.

- `2501.02573v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02573v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02573v1)

> The machine learning and data science community has made significant while dispersive progress in accelerating transformer-based large language models (LLMs), and one promising approach is to replace the original causal attention in a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) with \emph{exponentially decaying causal linear attention}. In this paper, we present LeetDecoding, which is the first Python package that provides a large set of computation routines for this fundamental operator. The launch of LeetDecoding was motivated by the current lack of (1) clear understanding of the complexity regarding this operator, (2) a comprehensive collection of existing computation methods (usually spread in seemingly unrelated fields), and (3) CUDA implementations for fast inference on GPU. LeetDecoding's design is easy to integrate with existing linear-attention LLMs, and allows for researchers to benchmark and evaluate new computation methods for exponentially decaying causal linear attention. The usage of LeetDecoding does not require any knowledge of GPU programming and the underlying complexity analysis, intentionally making LeetDecoding accessible to LLM practitioners. The source code of LeetDecoding is provided at \href{https://github.com/Computational-Machine-Intelligence/LeetDecoding}{this GitHub repository}, and users can simply install LeetDecoding by the command \texttt{pip install leet-decoding}.

- `2406.05469v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05469v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05469v2)

> It is common practice to combine deep neural networks into ensembles. These deep ensembles can benefit from the cancellation of errors effect: Errors by ensemble members may average out, leading to better generalization performance than each individual network. Bayesian neural networks learn a posterior distribution over model parameters, and sampling and weighting networks according to this posterior yields an ensemble model referred to as a Bayes ensemble. This study reviews the argument that neither the sampling nor the weighting in Bayes ensembles are particularly well suited for increasing generalization performance, as they do not support the cancellation of errors effect. In contrast, we show that a weighted average of models, where the weights are optimized by minimizing a second-order PAC-Bayesian generalization bound, can improve generalization. It is crucial that the optimization takes correlations between models into account. This can be achieved by minimizing the tandem loss, which requires hold-out data for estimating error correlations. The tandem loss based PAC-Bayesian weighting increases robustness against correlated models and models with lower performance in an ensemble. This allows us to safely add several models from the same learning process to an ensemble, instead of using early-stopping for selecting a single weight configuration. Our experiments provide further evidence that state-of-the-art intricate Bayes ensembles do not outperform simple uniformly weighted deep ensembles in terms of classification accuracy. Additionally, we show that these Bayes ensembles cannot match the performance of deep ensembles weighted by optimizing the tandem loss, which additionally provides nonvacuous rigorous generalization guarantees.

> Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.

> Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely used algorithm for attributing the outputs of a deep neural network to its input features. Due to the absence of closed-form integrals for deep learning models, inaccurate Riemann Sum approximations are used to calculate IG. This often introduces undesirable errors in the form of high levels of noise, leading to false insights in the model's decision-making process. We introduce a framework, RiemannOpt, that minimizes these errors by optimizing the sample point selection for the Riemann Sum. Our algorithm is highly versatile and applicable to IG as well as its derivatives like Blur IG and Guided IG. RiemannOpt achieves up to 20% improvement in Insertion Scores. Additionally, it enables its users to curtail computational costs by up to four folds, thereby making it highly functional for constrained environments.

> Sexism in online content is a pervasive issue that necessitates effective classification techniques to mitigate its harmful impact. Online platforms often have sexist comments and posts that create a hostile environment, especially for women and minority groups. This content not only spreads harmful stereotypes but also causes emotional harm. Reliable methods are essential to find and remove sexist content, making online spaces safer and more welcoming. Therefore, the sEXism Identification in Social neTworks (EXIST) challenge addresses this issue at CLEF 2024. This study aims to improve sexism identification in bilingual contexts (English and Spanish) by leveraging natural language processing models. The tasks are to determine whether a text is sexist and what the source intention behind it is. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model and separately used GPT-3.5 with few-shot learning prompts to classify sexist content. The XLM-RoBERTa model exhibited robust performance in handling complex linguistic structures, while GPT-3.5's few-shot learning capability allowed for rapid adaptation to new data with minimal labeled examples. Our approach using XLM-RoBERTa achieved 4th place in the soft-soft evaluation of Task 1 (sexism identification). For Task 2 (source intention), we achieved 2nd place in the soft-soft evaluation.

> Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention for its ability to efficiently represent spatiotemporal information in a lightweight format. Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton sequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around human physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework. Alternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture higher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex joint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces motion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a fresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action recognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both traditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN and Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal graph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against motion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of Taylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion dynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This study underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to effectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action recognition.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as an effective tool for fraud detection, identifying fraudulent users, and uncovering malicious behaviors. However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.

> Medical imaging is crucial for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. The medical reports of radiology images are the primary medium through which medical professionals attest their findings, but their writing is time consuming and requires specialized clinical expertise. The automated generation of radiography reports has thus the potential to improve and standardize patient care and significantly reduce clinicians workload. Through our work, we have designed and evaluated an end-to-end transformer-based method to generate accurate and factually complete radiology reports for X-ray images. Additionally, we are the first to introduce curriculum learning for end-to-end transformers in medical imaging and demonstrate its impact in obtaining improved performance. The experiments have been conducted using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG database, the largest available chest X-ray dataset. The results obtained are comparable with the current state-of-the-art on the natural language generation (NLG) metrics BLEU and ROUGE-L, while setting new state-of-the-art results on F1 examples-averaged, F1-macro and F1-micro metrics for clinical accuracy and on the METEOR metric widely used for NLG.

> With the growing significance of network security, the classification of encrypted traffic has emerged as an urgent challenge. Traditional byte-based traffic analysis methods are constrained by the rigid granularity of information and fail to fully exploit the diverse correlations between bytes. To address these limitations, this paper introduces MH-Net, a novel approach for classifying network traffic that leverages multi-view heterogeneous traffic graphs to model the intricate relationships between traffic bytes. The essence of MH-Net lies in aggregating varying numbers of traffic bits into multiple types of traffic units, thereby constructing multi-view traffic graphs with diverse information granularities. By accounting for different types of byte correlations, such as header-payload relationships, MH-Net further endows the traffic graph with heterogeneity, significantly enhancing model performance. Notably, we employ contrastive learning in a multi-task manner to strengthen the robustness of the learned traffic unit representations. Experiments conducted on the ISCX and CIC-IoT datasets for both the packet-level and flow-level traffic classification tasks demonstrate that MH-Net achieves the best overall performance compared to dozens of SOTA methods.

> Mathematical word problems (MWPs) involve the task of converting textual descriptions into mathematical equations. This poses a significant challenge in natural language processing, particularly for low-resource languages such as Bengali. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an innovative approach to solving Bengali MWPs using transformer-based models, including Basic Transformer, mT5, BanglaT5, and mBART50. To support this effort, the "PatiGonit" dataset was introduced, containing 10,000 Bengali math problems, and these models were fine-tuned to translate the word problems into equations accurately. The evaluation revealed that the mT5 model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.30%, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer models in this domain. This research marks a significant step forward in Bengali natural language processing, offering valuable methodologies and resources for educational AI tools. By improving math education, it also supports the development of advanced problem-solving skills for Bengali-speaking students.

> We introduce a new variant of contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) called observation-augmented CMABs (OA-CMABs) wherein a robot uses extra outcome observations from an external information source, e.g. humans. In OA-CMABs, external observations are a function of context features and thus provide evidence on top of observed option outcomes to infer hidden parameters. However, if external data is error-prone, measures must be taken to preserve the correctness of inference. To this end, we derive a robust Bayesian inference process for OA-CMABs based on recently developed probabilistic semantic data association techniques, which handle complex mixture model parameter priors and hybrid discrete-continuous observation likelihoods for semantic external data sources. To cope with combined uncertainties in OA-CMABs, we also derive a new active inference algorithm for optimal option selection based on approximate expected free energy minimization. This generalizes prior work on CMAB active inference by accounting for faulty observations and non-Gaussian distributions. Results for a simulated deep space search site selection problem show that, even if incorrect semantic observations are provided externally, e.g. by scientists, efficient decision-making and robust parameter inference are still achieved in a wide variety of conditions.

> Autoencoders have found widespread application in both their original deterministic form and in their variational formulation (VAEs). In scientific applications and in image processing it is often of interest to consider data that are viewed as functions; while discretisation (of differential equations arising in the sciences) or pixellation (of images) renders problems finite dimensional in practice, conceiving first of algorithms that operate on functions, and only then discretising or pixellating, leads to better algorithms that smoothly operate between resolutions. In this paper function-space versions of the autoencoder (FAE) and variational autoencoder (FVAE) are introduced, analysed, and deployed. Well-definedness of the objective governing VAEs is a subtle issue, particularly in function space, limiting applicability. For the FVAE objective to be well defined requires compatibility of the data distribution with the chosen generative model; this can be achieved, for example, when the data arise from a stochastic differential equation, but is generally restrictive. The FAE objective, on the other hand, is well defined in many situations where FVAE fails to be. Pairing the FVAE and FAE objectives with neural operator architectures that can be evaluated on any mesh enables new applications of autoencoders to inpainting, superresolution, and generative modelling of scientific data.

> Clustering algorithms are fundamental tools in data analysis, with hierarchical methods being particularly valuable for their flexibility. Chameleon is a widely used hierarchical clustering algorithm that excels at identifying high-quality clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes, and densities. Chameleon2 is the most recent variant that has demonstrated significant improvements, but suffers from critical failings and there are certain improvements that can be made.   The first failure we address is that the complexity of Chameleon2 is claimed to be $O(n^2)$, while we demonstrate that it is actually $O(n^2\log{n})$, with $n$ being the number of data points. Furthermore, we suggest improvements to Chameleon2 that ensure that the complexity remains $O(n^2)$ with minimal to no loss of performance. The second failing of Chameleon2 is that it lacks transparency and it does not provide the fine-tuned algorithm parameters used to obtain the claimed results. We meticulously provide all such parameter values to enhance replicability.   The improvement which we make in Chameleon2 is that we replace the exact $k$-NN search with an approximate $k$-NN search. This further reduces the algorithmic complexity down to $O(n\log{n})$ without any performance loss. Here, we primarily configure three approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms (Annoy, FLANN and NMSLIB) to align with the overarching Chameleon2 clustering framework. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Chameleon2++ algorithm is more efficient, robust, and computationally optimal.

> Accurate detection of wind fields within the troposphere is essential for atmospheric dynamics research and plays a crucial role in extreme weather forecasting. Coherent Doppler wind lidar (CDWL) is widely regarded as the most suitable technique for high spatial and temporal resolution wind field detection. However, since coherent detection relies heavily on the concentration of aerosol particles, which cause Mie scattering, the received backscattering lidar signal exhibits significantly low intensity at high altitudes. As a result, conventional methods, such as spectral centroid estimation, often fail to produce credible and accurate wind retrieval results in these regions. To address this issue, we propose LWFNet, the first Lidar-based Wind Field (WF) retrieval neural Network, built upon Transformer and the Kolmogorov-Arnold network. Our model is trained solely on targets derived from the traditional wind retrieval algorithm and utilizes radiosonde measurements as the ground truth for test results evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that LWFNet not only extends the maximum wind field detection range but also produces more accurate results, exhibiting a level of precision that surpasses the labeled targets. This phenomenon, which we refer to as super-accuracy, is explored by investigating the potential underlying factors that contribute to this intriguing occurrence. In addition, we compare the performance of LWFNet with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, highlighting its superior effectiveness and capability in high-resolution wind retrieval. LWFNet demonstrates remarkable performance in lidar-based wind field retrieval, setting a benchmark for future research and advancing the development of deep learning models in this domain.

> We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with an unknown linear constraint using a membership oracle that, given a solution, determines whether it is feasible or infeasible with absolute certainty. The goal of the decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we adapt a classical framework in order to solve the problem by learning and exploiting a surrogate linear constraint. The resulting new framework includes training a linear separator on the labeled points and selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active learning literature, one can consider using SVM as a linear classifier and the information-based sampling strategy known as simple margin. We improve on both sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on the pure knapsack problem and on a college study plan problem from the literature to show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence the quality of the results in terms of objective value.

> Existing methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection use various techniques to produce a score, separate from classification, that determines how ``OOD'' an input is. Our insight is that OOD detection can be simplified by using a neural network architecture which can effectively merge classification and OOD detection into a single step. Radial basis function networks (RBFNs) inherently link classification confidence and OOD detection; however, these networks have lost popularity due to the difficult of training them in a multi-layer fashion. In this work, we develop a multi-layer radial basis function network (MLRBFN) which can be easily trained. To ensure that these networks are also effective for OOD detection, we develop a novel depression mechanism. We apply MLRBFNs as standalone classifiers and as heads on top of pretrained feature extractors, and find that they are competitive with commonly used methods for OOD detection. Our MLRBFN architecture demonstrates a promising new direction for OOD detection methods.

> Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. However, a notable research gap exists in the evaluation of social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several strategies for bias mitigation, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and iterative prompting. Our experiments show that iterative prompting can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Solar is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.

> Decoding human activity from EEG signals has long been a popular research topic. While recent studies have increasingly shifted focus from single-subject to cross-subject analysis, few have explored the model's ability to perform zero-shot predictions on EEG signals from previously unseen subjects. This research aims to investigate whether deep learning methods can capture subject-independent semantic information inherent in human EEG signals. Such insights are crucial for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, on one hand, they demonstrate the model's robustness against subject-specific temporal biases, and on the other, they significantly enhance the generalizability of downstream tasks. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as denoising agents to extract subject-independent semantic features from noisy EEG signals. Experimental results, including ablation studies, highlight the pivotal role of LLMs in decoding subject-independent semantic information from noisy EEG data. We hope our findings will contribute to advancing BCI research and assist both academia and industry in applying EEG signals to a broader range of applications.

- `2501.02625v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02625v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02625v1)

> Quantized training of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an open challenge, as maintaining accuracy while performing all matrix multiplications in low precision has proven difficult. This is particularly the case when fine-tuning pre-trained models, which often already have large weight and activation outlier values that render quantized optimization difficult. We present HALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that enables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic placement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, to mitigate outliers during the low-precision computation, 2) FSDP integration for low-precision communication, and 3) high-performance kernel support. Our approach ensures that all large matrix multiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower precision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves near-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks, while delivering up to 1.31x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX 4090 GPUs. Our method supports both standard and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, both backed by efficient kernel implementations. Our results demonstrate the first practical approach to fully quantized LLM fine-tuning that maintains accuracy in FP8 precision, while delivering performance benefits.

> Prior research shows that differences in the early period of neural network training significantly impact the performance of in-distribution (ID) data of tasks. Yet, the implications of early learning dynamics on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remain poorly understood, primarily due to the complexities and limitations of existing analytical techniques. In this work, we investigate the relationship between learning dynamics, OOD generalization under covariate shift and the early period of neural network training. We utilize the trace of Fisher Information and sharpness, focusing on gradual unfreezing (i.e., progressively unfreezing parameters during training) as our methodology for investigation. Through a series of empirical experiments, we show that 1) changing the number of trainable parameters during the early period of training via gradual unfreezing can significantly improve OOD results; 2) the trace of Fisher Information and sharpness can be used as indicators for the removal of gradual unfreezing during the early period of training for better OOD generalization. Our experiments on both image and text data show that the early period of training is a general phenomenon that can provide Pareto improvements in ID and OOD performance with minimal complexity. Our work represents a first step towards understanding how early learning dynamics affect neural network OOD generalization under covariate shift and suggests a new avenue to improve and study this problem.

> A critical part of creating code suggestion systems is the pre-training of Large Language Models on vast amounts of source code and natural language text, often of questionable origin or quality. This may contribute to the presence of bugs and vulnerabilities in code generated by LLMs. While efforts to identify bugs at or after code generation exist, it is preferable to pre-train or fine-tune LLMs on curated, high-quality, and compliant datasets. The need for vast amounts of training data necessitates that such curation be automated, minimizing human intervention.   We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the complete version history of open-source software projects to improve the quality of training data. This approach leverages the version history of all OSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have undergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples that include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities. We evaluate this method using The Stack v2 dataset, and find that 17% of the code versions in the dataset have newer versions, with 17% of those representing bug fixes, including 2.36% addressing known CVEs. The deduplicated version of Stack v2 still includes blobs vulnerable to 6,947 known CVEs. Furthermore, 58% of the blobs in the dataset were never modified after creation, suggesting they likely represent software with minimal or no use. Misidentified blob origins present an additional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively licensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.   By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations. We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.

> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, including chatbot assistants and code generation, aligning their behavior with safety and ethical standards has become paramount. However, jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to elicit unintended or harmful outputs, threaten LLMs' safety significantly. In this paper, we introduce Layer-AdvPatcher, a novel methodology designed to defend against jailbreak attacks by utilizing an unlearning strategy to patch specific layers within LLMs through self-augmented datasets. Our insight is that certain layer(s), tend to produce affirmative tokens when faced with harmful prompts. By identifying these layers and adversarially exposing them to generate more harmful data, one can understand their inherent and diverse vulnerabilities to attacks. With these exposures, we then "unlearn" these issues, reducing the impact of affirmative tokens and hence minimizing jailbreak risks while keeping the model's responses to safe queries intact. We conduct extensive experiments on two models, four benchmark datasets, and multiple state-of-the-art jailbreak benchmarks to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Results indicate that our framework reduces the harmfulness and attack success rate of jailbreak attacks without compromising utility for benign queries compared to recent defense methods.

> This paper introduces a novel method for open-vocabulary 3D scene querying in autonomous driving by combining Language Embedded 3D Gaussians with Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose utilizing LLMs to generate both contextually canonical phrases and helping positive words for enhanced segmentation and scene interpretation. Our method leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo as an expert model to create a high-quality text dataset, which we then use to fine-tune smaller, more efficient LLMs for on-device deployment. Our comprehensive evaluation on the WayveScenes101 dataset demonstrates that LLM-guided segmentation significantly outperforms traditional approaches based on predefined canonical phrases. Notably, our fine-tuned smaller models achieve performance comparable to larger expert models while maintaining faster inference times. Through ablation studies, we discover that the effectiveness of helping positive words correlates with model scale, with larger models better equipped to leverage additional semantic information. This work represents a significant advancement towards more efficient, context-aware autonomous driving systems, effectively bridging 3D scene representation with high-level semantic querying while maintaining practical deployment considerations.

> We present a novel approach for test-time adaptation via online self-training, consisting of two components. First, we introduce a statistical framework that detects distribution shifts in the classifier's entropy values obtained on a stream of unlabeled samples. Second, we devise an online adaptation mechanism that utilizes the evidence of distribution shifts captured by the detection tool to dynamically update the classifier's parameters. The resulting adaptation process drives the distribution of test entropy values obtained from the self-trained classifier to match those of the source domain, building invariance to distribution shifts. This approach departs from the conventional self-training method, which focuses on minimizing the classifier's entropy. Our approach combines concepts in betting martingales and online learning to form a detection tool capable of quickly reacting to distribution shifts. We then reveal a tight relation between our adaptation scheme and optimal transport, which forms the basis of our novel self-supervised loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves test-time accuracy under distribution shifts while maintaining accuracy and calibration in their absence, outperforming leading entropy minimization methods across various scenarios.

> Accurate imputation of missing laboratory values in electronic health records (EHRs) is critical to enable robust clinical predictions and reduce biases in AI systems in healthcare. Existing methods, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and decision tree-based approaches such as XGBoost, struggle to model the complex temporal and contextual dependencies in EHR data, mainly in underrepresented groups. In this work, we propose Lab-MAE, a novel transformer-based masked autoencoder framework that leverages self-supervised learning for the imputation of continuous sequential lab values. Lab-MAE introduces a structured encoding scheme that jointly models laboratory test values and their corresponding timestamps, enabling explicit capturing temporal dependencies. Empirical evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrates that Lab-MAE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines such as XGBoost across multiple metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Wasserstein distance (WD). Notably, Lab-MAE achieves equitable performance across demographic groups of patients, advancing fairness in clinical predictions. We further investigate the role of follow-up laboratory values as potential shortcut features, revealing Lab-MAE's robustness in scenarios where such data is unavailable. The findings suggest that our transformer-based architecture, adapted to the characteristics of the EHR data, offers a foundation model for more accurate and fair clinical imputation models. In addition, we measure and compare the carbon footprint of Lab-MAE with the baseline XGBoost model, highlighting its environmental requirements.

> Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}.   A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.

This work not only serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of adversarial robustness but also identifies key areas for future research in textual adversarial defence. By establishing a new standard for benchmarking in this domain, we aim to accelerate progress towards more robust and reliable natural language processing systems.

> Federated Learning (FL) has gained prominence as a decentralized machine learning paradigm, allowing clients to collaboratively train a global model while preserving data privacy. Despite its potential, FL faces significant challenges in heterogeneous environments, where varying client resources and capabilities can undermine overall system performance. Existing approaches primarily focus on maximizing global model accuracy, often at the expense of unfairness among clients and suboptimal system efficiency, particularly in non-IID (non-Independent and Identically Distributed) settings. In this paper, we introduce FLamma, a novel Federated Learning framework based on adaptive gamma-based Stackelberg game, designed to address the aforementioned limitations and promote fairness. Our approach allows the server to act as the leader, dynamically adjusting a decay factor while clients, acting as followers, optimally select their number of local epochs to maximize their utility. Over time, the server incrementally balances client influence, initially rewarding higher-contributing clients and gradually leveling their impact, driving the system toward a Stackelberg Equilibrium. Extensive simulations on both IID and non-IID datasets show that our method significantly improves fairness in accuracy distribution without compromising overall model performance or convergence speed, outperforming traditional FL baselines.

> Unsupervised domain adaptation is critical to many real-world applications where label information is unavailable in the target domain. In general, without further assumptions, the joint distribution of the features and the label is not identifiable in the target domain. To address this issue, we rely on the property of minimal changes of causal mechanisms across domains to minimize unnecessary influences of distribution shifts. To encode this property, we first formulate the data-generating process using a latent variable model with two partitioned latent subspaces: invariant components whose distributions stay the same across domains and sparse changing components that vary across domains. We further constrain the domain shift to have a restrictive influence on the changing components. Under mild conditions, we show that the latent variables are partially identifiable, from which it follows that the joint distribution of data and labels in the target domain is also identifiable. Given the theoretical insights, we propose a practical domain adaptation framework called iMSDA. Extensive experimental results reveal that iMSDA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation algorithms on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

> While Vision Language Models (VLMs) are impressive in tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning, their ability to apply multi-step reasoning to images has lagged, giving rise to perceptions of modality imbalance or brittleness. Towards systematic study of such issues, we introduce a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning (AVR), comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. We seek strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of the tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., S2H generalization. This synthetic framework, where each task also has a text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance, and how it is impacted by training strategy. Ablations highlight the importance of explicit image-to-text conversion in promoting S2H generalization when using auto-regressive training. We also report results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon, including a measure of gradient alignment that seems to identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization.

> We apply physics-augmented neural network (PANN) constitutive models to experimental uniaxial tensile data of rubber-like materials whose behavior depends on manufacturing parameters. For this, we conduct experimental investigations on a 3D printed digital material at different mix ratios and consider several datasets from literature, including Ecoflex at different Shore hardness and a photocured 3D printing material at different grayscale values. We introduce a parametrized hyperelastic PANN model which can represent material behavior at different manufacturing parameters. The proposed model fulfills common mechanical conditions of hyperelasticity. In addition, the hyperelastic potential of the proposed model is monotonic in isotropic isochoric strain invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. In incompressible hyperelasticity, this is a relaxed version of the ellipticity (or rank-one convexity) condition. Using this relaxed ellipticity condition, the PANN model has enough flexibility to be applicable to a wide range of materials while having enough structure for a stable extrapolation outside the calibration data. The monotonic PANN yields excellent results for all materials studied and can represent a wide range of largely varying qualitative and quantitative stress behavior. Although calibrated on uniaxial tensile data only, it leads to a stable numerical behavior of 3D finite element simulations. The findings of our work suggest that monotonicity could play a key role in the formulation of very general yet robust and stable constitutive models applicable to materials with highly nonlinear and parametrized behavior.

For many, Granger causality (GC) remains a computational tool of choice to identify causal relations in time series data. Like other causal discovery tools, GC has limitations and has been criticized as a non-causal framework. Here, we addressed one of the recurring criticisms of GC by endowing it with proper causal interpretation. This was achieved by analyzing GC from Reichenbach's Common Cause Principles (RCCPs) and causal Bayesian networks (CBNs) lenses. We showed theoretically and graphically that this reformulation endowed GC with a proper causal interpretation under certain assumptions and achieved satisfactory results on simulation.

> Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are developmental conditions characterized by restricted interests and difficulties in communication. The complexity of ASD has resulted in a deficiency of objective diagnostic biomarkers. Deep learning methods have gained recognition for addressing these challenges in neuroimaging analysis, but finding and interpreting such diagnostic biomarkers are still challenging computationally. Here, we propose a feature reduction pipeline using resting-state fMRI data. We used Craddock atlas and Power atlas to extract functional connectivity data from rs-fMRI, resulting in over 30 thousand features. By using a denoising variational autoencoder, our proposed pipeline further compresses the connectivity features into 5 latent Gaussian distributions, providing is a low-dimensional representation of the data to promote computational efficiency and interpretability. To test the method, we employed the extracted latent representations to classify ASD using traditional classifiers such as SVM on a large multi-site dataset. The 95% confidence interval for the prediction accuracy of SVM is [0.63, 0.76] after site harmonization using the extracted latent distributions. Without using DVAE for dimensionality reduction, the prediction accuracy is 0.70, which falls within the interval. The DVAE successfully encoded the diagnostic information from rs-fMRI data without sacrificing prediction performance. The runtime for training the DVAE and obtaining classification results from its extracted latent features was 7 times shorter compared to training classifiers directly on the raw data. Our findings suggest that the Power atlas provides more effective brain connectivity insights for diagnosing ASD than Craddock atlas. Additionally, we visualized the latent representations to gain insights into the brain networks contributing to the differences between ASD and neurotypical brains.

- *Chia-Yi Hsu, Yu-Lin Tsai, Chih-Hsun Lin, Pin-Yu Chen, Chia-Mu Yu, Chun-Ying Huang*

- `2405.16833v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16833v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16833v2)

> While large language models (LLMs) such as Llama-2 or GPT-4 have shown impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning is still necessary to enhance their performance for customized datasets, domain-specific tasks, or other private needs. However, fine-tuning all parameters of LLMs requires significant hardware resources, which can be impractical for typical users. Therefore, parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA have emerged, allowing users to fine-tune LLMs without the need for considerable computing resources, with little performance degradation compared to fine-tuning all parameters. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that fine-tuning can increase the risk to the safety of LLMs, even when data does not contain malicious content. To address this challenge, we propose Safe LoRA, a simple one-liner patch to the original LoRA implementation by introducing the projection of LoRA weights from selected layers to the safety-aligned subspace, effectively reducing the safety risks in LLM fine-tuning while maintaining utility. It is worth noting that Safe LoRA is a training-free and data-free approach, as it only requires the knowledge of the weights from the base and aligned LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that when fine-tuning on purely malicious data, Safe LoRA retains similar safety performance as the original aligned model. Moreover, when the fine-tuning dataset contains a mixture of both benign and malicious data, Safe LoRA mitigates the negative effect made by malicious data while preserving performance on downstream tasks. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/IBM/SafeLoRA}.

> Having a sufficient quantity of quality data is a critical enabler of training effective machine learning models. Being able to effectively determine the adequacy of a dataset prior to training and evaluating a model's performance would be an essential tool for anyone engaged in experimental design or data collection. However, despite the need for it, the ability to prospectively assess data sufficiency remains an elusive capability. We report here on two experiments undertaken in an attempt to better ascertain whether or not basic descriptive statistical measures can be indicative of how effective a dataset will be at training a resulting model. Leveraging the effect size of our features, this work first explores whether or not a correlation exists between effect size, and resulting model performance (theorizing that the magnitude of the distinction between classes could correlate to a classifier's resulting success). We then explore whether or not the magnitude of the effect size will impact the rate of convergence of our learning rate, (theorizing again that a greater effect size may indicate that the model will converge more rapidly, and with a smaller sample size needed). Our results appear to indicate that this is not an effective heuristic for determining adequate sample size or projecting model performance, and therefore that additional work is still needed to better prospectively assess adequacy of data.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and translation, among others. However, these models often generate texts that can perpetuate biases. Existing approaches to mitigate these biases usually compromise knowledge retention. This study explores whether LLMs can produce safe, unbiased outputs without sacrificing knowledge or comprehension. We introduce the Safe and Responsible Large Language Model (\textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$), which has been instruction fine-tuned atop of a safe fine-tuned auto-regressive decoder-only LLM to reduce biases in generated texts. We developed a specialized dataset with examples of unsafe and corresponding safe variations to train \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ to identify and correct biased text. Experiments on our specialized dataset and out-of-distribution test sets reveal that \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ effectively reduces biases while preserving knowledge integrity. This performance surpasses that of traditional fine-tuning of smaller language models and base LLMs that merely reply on prompting techniques. Our findings demonstrate that instruction fine-tuning on custom datasets tailored for tasks such as debiasing is a highly effective strategy for minimizing bias in LLM while preserving their inherent knowledge and capabilities. The code and dataset are accessible at \href{https://github.com/shainarazavi/Safe-Responsible-LLM}{SR-LLM}

> Protein design with desirable properties has been a significant challenge for many decades. Generative artificial intelligence is a promising approach and has achieved great success in various protein generation tasks. Notably, diffusion models stand out for their robust mathematical foundations and impressive generative capabilities, offering unique advantages in certain applications such as protein design. In this review, we first give the definition and characteristics of diffusion models and then focus on two strategies: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Score-based Generative Models, where DDPM is the discrete form of SGM. Furthermore, we discuss their applications in protein design, peptide generation, drug discovery, and protein-ligand interaction. Finally, we outline the future perspectives of diffusion models to advance autonomous protein design and engineering. The E(3) group consists of all rotations, reflections, and translations in three-dimensions. The equivariance on the E(3) group can keep the physical stability of the frame of each amino acid as much as possible, and we reflect on how to keep the diffusion model E(3) equivariant for protein generation.

> Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a critical aspect of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly in high-risk domains such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and financial technology, where decision-making processes must account for uncertainty. This review explores the evolution of uncertainty quantification techniques in AI, distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and discusses the mathematical foundations and methods used to quantify these uncertainties. We provide an overview of advanced techniques, including probabilistic methods, ensemble learning, sampling-based approaches, and generative models, while also highlighting hybrid approaches that integrate domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, we examine the diverse applications of UQ across various fields, emphasizing its impact on decision-making, predictive accuracy, and system robustness. The review also addresses key challenges such as scalability, efficiency, and integration with explainable AI, and outlines future directions for research in this rapidly developing area. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of UQ's role in enhancing the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of AI systems.

- *Daniel Petrov*

> Large scale pretrained language models have demonstrated high performance on standard datasets for natural language inference (NLI) tasks. Unfortunately, these evaluations can be misleading, as although the models can perform well on in-distribution data, they perform poorly on out-of-distribution test sets, such as contrast sets. Contrast sets consist of perturbed instances of data that have very minor, but meaningful, changes to the input that alter the gold label, revealing how models can learn superficial patterns in the training data rather than learning more sophisticated language nuances. As an example, the ELECTRA-small language model achieves nearly 90% accuracy on an SNLI dataset but drops to 75% when tested on an out-of-distribution contrast set. The research performed in this study explores how a language models' robustness can be improved by exposing it to small amounts of more complex contrast sets during training to help it better learn language patterns. With this approach, the model regains performance and achieves nearly 90% accuracy on contrast sets, highlighting the importance of diverse and challenging training data.

> Background: The increasing adoption of AI assistants in programming has led to numerous studies exploring their benefits. While developers consistently report significant productivity gains from these tools, empirical measurements often show more modest improvements. While prior research has documented self-reported experiences with AI-assisted programming tools, little to no work has been done to understand their usage patterns and the actual cognitive load imposed in practice. Objective: In this exploratory study, we aim to investigate the role AI assistants play in developer productivity. Specifically, we are interested in how developers' expertise levels influence their AI usage patterns, and how these patterns impact their actual cognitive load and productivity during development tasks. We also seek to better understand how this relates to their perceived productivity. Method: We propose a controlled observational study combining physiological measurements (EEG and eye tracking) with interaction data to examine developers' use of AI-assisted programming tools. We will recruit professional developers to complete programming tasks both with and without AI assistance while measuring their cognitive load and task completion time. Through pre- and post-task questionnaires, we will collect data on perceived productivity and cognitive load using NASA-TLX.

> This work introduces an approach rooted in quantum thermodynamics to enhance sampling efficiency in quantum machine learning (QML). We propose conceptualizing quantum supervised learning as a thermodynamic cooling process. Building on this concept, we develop a quantum refrigerator protocol that enhances sample efficiency during training and prediction without the need for Grover iterations or quantum phase estimation. Inspired by heat-bath algorithmic cooling protocols, our method alternates entropy compression and thermalization steps to decrease the entropy of qubits, increasing polarization towards the dominant bias. This technique minimizes the computational overhead associated with estimating classification scores and gradients, presenting a practical and efficient solution for QML algorithms compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

> In the task of comparing two classification algorithms, the widely-used McNemar's test aims to infer the presence of a significant difference between the error rates of the two classification algorithms. However, the power of the conventional McNemar's test is usually unpromising because the hold-out (HO) method in the test merely uses a single train-validation split that usually produces a highly varied estimation of the error rates. In contrast, a cross-validation (CV) method repeats the HO method in multiple times and produces a stable estimation. Therefore, a CV method has a great advantage to improve the power of McNemar's test. Among all types of CV methods, a block-regularized 5$\times$2 CV (BCV) has been shown in many previous studies to be superior to the other CV methods in the comparison task of algorithms because the 5$\times$2 BCV can produce a high-quality estimator of the error rate by regularizing the numbers of overlapping records between all training sets. In this study, we compress the 10 correlated contingency tables in the 5$\times$2 BCV to form an effective contingency table. Then, we define a 5$\times$2 BCV McNemar's test on the basis of the effective contingency table. We demonstrate the reasonable type I error and the promising power of the proposed 5$\times$2 BCV McNemar's test on multiple simulated and real-world data sets.

> This work presents a novel architecture for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to improve Question Answering (QA) tasks from a target corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the analyzing and generation of human-like text. These models rely on pre-trained data and lack real-time updates unless integrated with live data tools. RAG enhances LLMs by integrating online resources and databases to generate contextually appropriate responses. However, traditional RAG still encounters challenges like information dilution and hallucinations when handling vast amounts of data. Our approach addresses these challenges by converting corpora into a domain-specific dataset and RAG architecture is constructed to generate responses from the target document. We introduce QuIM-RAG (Question-to-question Inverted Index Matching), a novel approach for the retrieval mechanism in our system. This strategy generates potential questions from document chunks and matches these with user queries to identify the most relevant text chunks for generating accurate answers. We have implemented our RAG system on top of the open-source Meta-LLaMA3-8B-instruct model by Meta Inc. that is available on Hugging Face. We constructed a custom corpus of 500+ pages from a high-traffic website accessed thousands of times daily for answering complex questions, along with manually prepared ground truth QA for evaluation. We compared our approach with traditional RAG models using BERT-Score and RAGAS, state-of-the-art metrics for evaluating LLM applications. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms traditional RAG architectures on both metrics.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained considerable traction in recent years due to the unparalleled results they gathered. However, the cost behind training such sophisticated models is resource intensive, resulting in many to consider DNNs to be intellectual property (IP) to model owners. In this era of cloud computing, high-performance DNNs are often deployed all over the internet so that people can access them publicly. As such, DNN watermarking schemes, especially backdoor-based watermarks, have been actively developed in recent years to preserve proprietary rights. Nonetheless, there lies much uncertainty on the robustness of existing backdoor watermark schemes, towards both adversarial attacks and unintended means such as fine-tuning neural network models. One reason for this is that no complete guarantee of robustness can be assured in the context of backdoor-based watermark. In this paper, we extensively evaluate the persistence of recent backdoor-based watermarks within neural networks in the scenario of fine-tuning, we propose/develop a novel data-driven idea to restore watermark after fine-tuning without exposing the trigger set. Our empirical results show that by solely introducing training data after fine-tuning, the watermark can be restored if model parameters do not shift dramatically during fine-tuning. Depending on the types of trigger samples used, trigger accuracy can be reinstated to up to 100%. Our study further explores how the restoration process works using loss landscape visualization, as well as the idea of introducing training data in fine-tuning stage to alleviate watermark vanishing.

> Although large models have shown a strong capacity to solve large-scale problems in many areas including natural language and computer vision, their voluminous parameters are hard to deploy in a real-time system due to computational and energy constraints. Addressing this, knowledge distillation through Teacher-Student architecture offers a sustainable pathway to compress the knowledge of large models into more manageable sizes without significantly compromising performance. To enhance the robustness and interpretability of this framework, it is critical to understand how individual training data impact model performance, which is an area that remains underexplored. We propose the \textbf{Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Influence Weight (KD-AIF)} framework which leverages influence functions from robust statistics to assign weights to training data, grounded in the four key SAFE principles: Sustainability, Accuracy, Fairness, and Explainability. This novel approach not only optimizes distillation but also increases transparency by revealing the significance of different data. The exploration of various update mechanisms within the KD-AIF framework further elucidates its potential to significantly improve learning efficiency and generalization in student models, marking a step toward more explainable and deployable Large Models. KD-AIF is effective in knowledge distillation while also showing exceptional performance in semi-supervised learning with outperforms existing baselines and methods in multiple benchmarks (CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10-4k, SVHN-1k, and GLUE).

In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database.

> We study goal-conditioned RL through the lens of generalization, but not in the traditional sense of random augmentations and domain randomization. Rather, we aim to learn goal-directed policies that generalize with respect to the horizon: after training to reach nearby goals (which are easy to learn), these policies should succeed in reaching distant goals (which are quite challenging to learn). In the same way that invariance is closely linked with generalization is other areas of machine learning (e.g., normalization layers make a network invariant to scale, and therefore generalize to inputs of varying scales), we show that this notion of horizon generalization is closely linked with invariance to planning: a policy navigating towards a goal will select the same actions as if it were navigating to a waypoint en route to that goal. Thus, such a policy trained to reach nearby goals should succeed at reaching arbitrarily-distant goals. Our theoretical analysis proves that both horizon generalization and planning invariance are possible, under some assumptions. We present new experimental results and recall findings from prior work in support of our theoretical results. Taken together, our results open the door to studying how techniques for invariance and generalization developed in other areas of machine learning might be adapted to achieve this alluring property.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks by understanding input information and predicting corresponding outputs. However, the internal mechanisms by which LLMs comprehend input and make effective predictions remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing from the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a non-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the following key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task spaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding; (2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at critical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we introduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context Learning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances reasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example information into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune LLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection mechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of task space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but also accelerates inference speed by over 40\%, while TS-FT achieves superior results with a minimal strategy adjustment.

> In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding. However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness. Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.

> Data encoding is a fundamental step in emerging computing paradigms, particularly in stochastic computing (SC) and hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where it plays a crucial role in determining the overall system performance and hardware cost efficiency. This study presents an advanced encoding strategy that leverages a hardware-friendly class of low-discrepancy (LD) sequences, specifically powers-of-2 bases of Van der Corput (VDC) sequences (VDC-2^n), as sources for random number generation. Our approach significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of SC and HDC systems by addressing challenges associated with randomness. By employing LD sequences, we improve correlation properties and reduce hardware complexity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and energy savings for SC and HDC systems. Our solution provides a robust framework for integrating SC and HDC in resource-constrained environments, paving the way for efficient and scalable AI implementations.

> The structural properties of naturally arising social graphs are extensively studied to understand their evolution. Prior approaches for modeling network dynamics typically rely on rule-based models, which lack realism and generalizability, or deep learning-based models, which require large-scale training datasets. Social graphs, as abstract graph representations of entity-wise interactions, present an opportunity to explore network evolution mechanisms through realistic simulations of human-item interactions. Leveraging the pre-trained social consensus knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs), we present GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic, text-attributed social graph generation. GAG simulates the temporal node and edge generation processes for zero-shot social graph generation. The resulting graphs exhibit adherence to seven key macroscopic network properties, achieving an 11% improvement in microscopic graph structure metrics. Through the node classification benchmarking task, we validate GAG effectively captures the intricate text-structure correlations in graph generation. Furthermore, GAG supports generating graphs with up to nearly 100,000 nodes or 10 million edges through large-scale LLM-based agent simulation with parallel acceleration, achieving a minimum speed-up of 90.4%.

> Maximizing a target variable as an operational objective in a structural causal model is an important problem. Causal Bayesian Optimization~(CBO) methods either rely on interventions that alter the causal structure to maximize the reward; or introduce action nodes to endogenous variables so that the data generation mechanisms are adjusted to achieve the objective. This paper introduces a novel method to learn the distribution of exogenous variables, which is typically marginalized through expectation or ignored by existing CBO methods. Exogenous distribution learning improves the approximation accuracy of structural causal models in a surrogate model that is usually trained with limited observational data. Moreover, the learned exogenous distribution extends existing CBO to general causal schemes beyond simple Additive Noise Models~(ANMs). The recovery of exogenous variables allows us to use a more flexible prior for noise or unobserved hidden variables. We develop a new CBO method by leveraging the learned exogenous distribution. Experiments on different datasets and applications show the benefits of our proposed method.

> Early screening for cancer has proven to improve the survival rate and spare patients from intensive and costly treatments due to late diagnosis. Cancer screening in the healthy population involves an initial risk stratification step to determine the screening method and frequency, primarily to optimize resource allocation by targeting screening towards individuals who draw most benefit. For most screening programs, age and clinical risk factors such as family history are part of the initial risk stratification algorithm. In this paper, we focus on developing a blood marker-based risk stratification approach, which could be used to identify patients with elevated cancer risk to be encouraged for taking a diagnostic test or participate in a screening program. We demonstrate that the combination of simple, widely available blood tests, such as complete blood count and complete metabolic panel, could potentially be used to identify patients at risk for colorectal, liver, and lung cancers with areas under the ROC curve of 0.76, 0.85, 0.78, respectively. Furthermore, we hypothesize that such an approach could not only be used as pre-screening risk assessment for individuals but also as population health management tool, for example to better interrogate the cancer risk in certain sub-populations.

> Graph Machine Learning is essential for understanding and analyzing relational data. However, privacy-sensitive applications demand the ability to efficiently remove sensitive information from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), avoiding the unnecessary time and space overhead caused by retraining models from scratch. To address this issue, Graph Unlearning (GU) has emerged as a critical solution, with the potential to support dynamic graph updates in data management systems and enable scalable unlearning in distributed data systems while ensuring privacy compliance. Unlike machine unlearning in computer vision or other fields, GU faces unique difficulties due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data and the recursive message-passing mechanism of GNNs. Additionally, the diversity of downstream tasks and the complexity of unlearning requests further amplify these challenges. Despite the proliferation of diverse GU strategies, the absence of a benchmark providing fair comparisons for GU, and the limited flexibility in combining downstream tasks and unlearning requests, have yielded inconsistencies in evaluations, hindering the development of this domain. To fill this gap, we present OpenGU, the first GU benchmark, where 16 SOTA GU algorithms and 37 multi-domain datasets are integrated, enabling various downstream tasks with 13 GNN backbones when responding to flexible unlearning requests. Based on this unified benchmark framework, we are able to provide a comprehensive and fair evaluation for GU. Through extensive experimentation, we have drawn $8$ crucial conclusions about existing GU methods, while also gaining valuable insights into their limitations, shedding light on potential avenues for future research.

> Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention as it facilitates collaborative machine learning among multiple clients without centralizing their data on a server. FL ensures the privacy of participating clients by locally storing their data, which creates new challenges in fairness. Traditional debiasing methods assume centralized access to sensitive information, rendering them impractical for the FL setting. Additionally, FL is more susceptible to fairness issues than centralized machine learning due to the diverse client data sources that may be associated with group information. Therefore, training a fair model in FL without access to client local data is important and challenging. This paper presents AFed, a straightforward yet effective framework for promoting group fairness in FL. The core idea is to circumvent restricted data access by learning the global data distribution. This paper proposes two approaches: AFed-G, which uses a conditional generator trained on the server side, and AFed-GAN, which improves upon AFed-G by training a conditional GAN on the client side. We augment the client data with the generated samples to help remove bias. Our theoretical analysis justifies the proposed methods, and empirical results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate a substantial improvement in AFed over several baselines.

> Since its introduction, the transformer has shifted the development trajectory away from traditional models (e.g., RNN, MLP) in time series forecasting, which is attributed to its ability to capture global dependencies within temporal tokens. Follow-up studies have largely involved altering the tokenization and self-attention modules to better adapt Transformers for addressing special challenges like non-stationarity, channel-wise dependency, and variable correlation in time series. However, we found that the expressive capability of sequence representation is a key factor influencing Transformer performance in time forecasting after investigating several representative methods, where there is an almost linear relationship between sequence representation entropy and mean square error, with more diverse representations performing better. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism with Sequence Complementors and prove feasible from an information theory perspective, where these learnable sequences are able to provide complementary information beyond current input to feed attention. We further enhance the Sequence Complementors via a diversification loss that is theoretically covered. The empirical evaluation of both long-term and short-term forecasting has confirmed its superiority over the recent state-of-the-art methods.

> Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.

- `2501.03284v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03284v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03284v1)

> Among the existing Transformer-based multivariate time series forecasting methods, iTransformer, which treats each variable sequence as a token and only explicitly extracts cross-variable dependencies, and PatchTST, which adopts a channel-independent strategy and only explicitly extracts cross-time dependencies, both significantly outperform most Channel-Dependent Transformer that simultaneously extract cross-time and cross-variable dependencies. This indicates that existing Transformer-based multivariate time series forecasting methods still struggle to effectively fuse these two types of information. We attribute this issue to the dynamic time lags in the causal relationships between different variables. Therefore, we propose a new multivariate time series forecasting Transformer, Sensorformer, which first compresses the global patch information and then simultaneously extracts cross-variable and cross-time dependencies from the compressed representations. Sensorformer can effectively capture the correct inter-variable correlations and causal relationships, even in the presence of dynamic causal lags between variables, while also reducing the computational complexity of pure cross-patch self-attention from $O(D^2 \cdot Patch\_num^2 \cdot d\_model)$ to $O(D^2 \cdot Patch\_num \cdot d\_model)$. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on 9 mainstream real-world multivariate time series forecasting datasets demonstrate the superiority of Sensorformer. The implementation of Sensorformer, following the style of the Time-series-library and scripts for reproducing the main results, is publicly available at https://github.com/BigYellowTiger/Sensorformer

> Text augmentation (TA) is a critical technique for text classification, especially in few-shot settings. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based TA method, TARDiS, to address challenges inherent in the generation and alignment stages of two-stage TA methods. For the generation stage, we propose two generation processes, SEG and CEG, incorporating multiple class-specific prompts to enhance diversity and separability. For the alignment stage, we introduce a class adaptation (CA) method to ensure that generated examples align with their target classes through verification and modification. Experimental results demonstrate TARDiS's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art LLM-based TA methods in various few-shot text classification tasks.

> To address the issues of a weak generalization capability and interpretability in working condition recognition model of a fused magnesium furnace, this paper proposes an interpretable working condition recognition method based on deep convolutional stochastic configuration networks (DCSCNs). Firstly, a supervised learning mechanism is employed to generate physically meaningful Gaussian differential convolution kernels. An incremental method is utilized to construct a DCSCNs model, ensuring the convergence of recognition errors in a hierarchical manner and avoiding the iterative optimization process of convolutional kernel parameters using the widely used backpropagation algorithm. The independent coefficient of channel feature maps is defined to obtain the visualization results of feature class activation maps for the fused magnesium furnace. A joint reward function is constructed based on the recognition accuracy, the interpretable trustworthiness evaluation metrics, and the model parameter quantity. Reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to adaptively prune the convolutional kernels of the DCSCNs model, aiming to build a compact, highly performed and interpretable network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other deep learning approaches in terms of recognition accuracy and interpretability.

> We focus on the task of unknown object rearrangement, where a robot is supposed to re-configure the objects into a desired goal configuration specified by an RGB-D image. Recent works explore unknown object rearrangement systems by incorporating learning-based perception modules. However, they are sensitive to perception error, and pay less attention to task-level performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective system for unknown object rearrangement amidst perception noise. We theoretically reveal that the noisy perception impacts grasp and place in a decoupled way, and show such a decoupled structure is valuable to improve task optimality. We propose GSP, a dual-loop system with the decoupled structure as prior. For the inner loop, we learn a see policy for self-confident in-hand object matching. For the outer loop, we learn a grasp policy aware of object matching and grasp capability guided by task-level rewards. We leverage the foundation model CLIP for object matching, policy learning and self-termination. A series of experiments indicate that GSP can conduct unknown object rearrangement with higher completion rates and fewer steps.

- `2501.02754v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02754v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02754v1)

> In recent years, attention-based models have excelled across various domains but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, often from downloading or fine-tuning on poisoned datasets. Many current methods to mitigate backdoors in NLP models rely on the pre-trained (unfine-tuned) weights, but these methods fail in scenarios where the pre-trained weights are not available. In this work, we propose MBTSAD, which can mitigate backdoors in the language model by utilizing only a small subset of clean data and does not require pre-trained weights. Specifically, MBTSAD retrains the backdoored model on a dataset generated by token splitting. Then MBTSAD leverages attention distillation, the retrained model is the teacher model, and the original backdoored model is the student model. Experimental results demonstrate that MBTSAD achieves comparable backdoor mitigation performance as the methods based on pre-trained weights while maintaining the performance on clean data. MBTSAD does not rely on pre-trained weights, enhancing its utility in scenarios where pre-trained weights are inaccessible. In addition, we simplify the min-max problem of adversarial training and visualize text representations to discover that the token splitting method in MBTSAD's first step generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading the model to learn more generalized features and eliminate backdoor patterns.

> Program errors can occur in any type of programming, and can manifest in a variety of ways, such as unexpected output, crashes, or performance issues. And program error diagnosis can often be too abstract or technical for developers to understand, especially for beginners. The goal of this paper is to present a novel machine-learning approach for Multi-task Program Error Repair and Explanatory Diagnosis (mPRED). A pre-trained language model is used to encode the source code, and a downstream model is specifically designed to identify and repair errors. Programs and test cases will be augmented and optimized from several perspectives. Additionally, our approach incorporates a "chain of thoughts" method, which enables the models to produce intermediate reasoning explanations before providing the final correction. To aid in visualizing and analyzing the program structure, we use a graph neural network for program structure visualization. Overall, our approach offers a promising approach for repairing program errors across different programming languages and providing helpful explanations to programmers.

> Hull form designing is an iterative process wherein the performance of the hull form needs to be checked via computational fluid dynamics calculations or model experiments. The stern shape has to undergo a process wherein the hull form variations from the pressure distribution analysis results are repeated until the resistance and propulsion efficiency meet the design requirements. In this study, the designer designed a pressure distribution that meets the design requirements; this paper proposes an inverse design algorithm that estimates the stern shape using deep learning. A convolutional neural network was used to extract the features of the pressure distribution expressed as a contour, whereas a multi-task learning model was used to estimate various sections of the stern shape. We estimated the stern shape indirectly by estimating the control point of the B-spline and comparing the actual and converted offsets for each section; the performance was verified, and an inverse design is proposed herein

> The Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system has become a standard feature in recent car models. While marketed as providing auto-steering capabilities, the system's operational characteristics and safety performance remain underexplored, primarily due to a lack of real-world testing and comprehensive data. To fill this gap, we extensively tested mainstream LKA systems from leading U.S. automakers in Tampa, Florida. Using an innovative method, we collected a comprehensive dataset that includes full Controller Area Network (CAN) messages with LKA attributes, as well as video, perception, and lateral trajectory data from a high-quality front-facing camera equipped with advanced vision detection and trajectory planning algorithms. Our tests spanned diverse, challenging conditions, including complex road geometry, adverse weather, degraded lane markings, and their combinations. A vision language model (VLM) further annotated the videos to capture weather, lighting, and traffic features. Based on this dataset, we present an empirical overview of LKA's operational features and safety performance. Key findings indicate: (i) LKA is vulnerable to faint markings and low pavement contrast; (ii) it struggles in lane transitions (merges, diverges, intersections), often causing unintended departures or disengagements; (iii) steering torque limitations lead to frequent deviations on sharp turns, posing safety risks; and (iv) LKA systems consistently maintain rigid lane-centering, lacking adaptability on tight curves or near large vehicles such as trucks. We conclude by demonstrating how this dataset can guide both infrastructure planning and self-driving technology. In view of LKA's limitations, we recommend improvements in road geometry and pavement maintenance. Additionally, we illustrate how the dataset supports the development of human-like LKA systems via VLM fine-tuning and Chain of Thought reasoning.

> Recent research in subject-driven generation increasingly emphasizes the importance of selective subject features. Nevertheless, accurately selecting the content in a given reference image still poses challenges, especially when selecting the similar subjects in an image (e.g., two different dogs). Some methods attempt to use text prompts or pixel masks to isolate specific elements. However, text prompts often fall short in precisely describing specific content, and pixel masks are often expensive. To address this, we introduce P3S-Diffusion, a novel architecture designed for context-selected subject-driven generation via point supervision. P3S-Diffusion leverages minimal cost label (e.g., points) to generate subject-driven images. During fine-tuning, it can generate an expanded base mask from these points, obviating the need for additional segmentation models. The mask is employed for inpainting and aligning with subject representation. The P3S-Diffusion preserves fine features of the subjects through Multi-layers Condition Injection. Enhanced by the Attention Consistency Loss for improved training, extensive experiments demonstrate its excellent feature preservation and image generation capabilities.

> Link prediction in heterogeneous networks is crucial for understanding the intricacies of network structures and forecasting their future developments. Traditional methodologies often face significant obstacles, including over-smoothing-wherein the excessive aggregation of node features leads to the loss of critical structural details-and a dependency on human-defined meta-paths, which necessitate extensive domain knowledge and can be inherently restrictive. These limitations hinder the effective prediction and analysis of complex heterogeneous networks. In response to these challenges, we propose the Contrastive Heterogeneous grAph Transformer (CHAT). CHAT introduces a novel sampling-based graph transformer technique that selectively retains nodes of interest, thereby obviating the need for predefined meta-paths. The method employs an innovative connection-aware transformer to encode node sequences and their interconnections with high fidelity, guided by a dual-faceted loss function specifically designed for heterogeneous network link prediction. Additionally, CHAT incorporates an ensemble link predictor that synthesizes multiple samplings to achieve enhanced prediction accuracy. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of CHAT using three distinct drug-target interaction (DTI) datasets. The empirical results underscore CHAT's superior performance, outperforming both general-task approaches and models specialized in DTI prediction. These findings substantiate the efficacy of CHAT in addressing the complex problem of link prediction in heterogeneous networks.

> Online linear programming plays an important role in both revenue management and resource allocation, and recent research has focused on developing efficient first-order online learning algorithms. Despite the empirical success of first-order methods, they typically achieve a regret no better than $\mathcal{O} ( \sqrt{T} )$, which is suboptimal compared to the $\mathcal{O} (\log T)$ bound guaranteed by the state-of-the-art linear programming (LP)-based online algorithms. This paper establishes a general framework that improves upon the $\mathcal{O} ( \sqrt{T} )$ result when the LP dual problem exhibits certain error bound conditions. For the first time, we show that first-order learning algorithms achieve $o( \sqrt{T} )$ regret in the continuous support setting and $\mathcal{O} (\log T)$ regret in the finite support setting beyond the non-degeneracy assumption. Our results significantly improve the state-of-the-art regret results and provide new insights for sequential decision-making.

> Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (PLM) emerges as the predominant strategy in many natural language processing applications. However, this process is known to be expensive, especially on edge devices with low computing power. While general approaches (e.g. quantization and distillation) have been widely studied to reduce the compute/memory of PLM fine-tuning, one-shot compression techniques specifically designed for fine-tuning remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the neural tangent kernel (NTK)--which reveals the gradient descent dynamics of neural networks--of the multilayer perceptrons (MLP) modules in a PLM and propose to coin a lightweight PLM through NTK-approximating MLP fusion. By incorporating NTK into the compression process, MLP Fusion not only preserves the original model's output but also maintains its training dynamics. To achieve this, we reconsider the MLP as a bundle of sub-MLPs and cluster them into a given number of centroids, which can then be restored as a compressed MLP and surprisingly well approximate the NTK of the original PLM. Our approach is applicable to both standard MLP modules and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modules in PLMs, demonstrating its scalability and versatility. Additionally, we provide theoretical derivations to demonstrate how the proposed compression preserves the NTK. Extensive experiments of PLM fine-tuning on both natural language understanding and generation tasks are provided to verify the effectiveness of MLP fusion.

However, despite the intuitive appeal, there remains a lack of compelling justification for the adoption of GNNs, as no direct evidence supports their necessity or effectiveness. To critically evaluate the current use of GNNs, we propose DiagMLP, a simple topology-agnostic baseline as a substitute for GNNs in fault diagnosis frameworks. Through experiments on five public datasets, we surprisingly find that DiagMLP performs competitively with and even outperforms GNN-based methods in fault diagnosis tasks, indicating that the current paradigm of using GNNs to model service dependencies has not yet demonstrated a tangible contribution. We further discuss potential reasons for this observation and advocate shifting the focus from solely pursuing novel model designs to developing challenging datasets, standardizing preprocessing protocols, and critically evaluating the utility of advanced deep learning modules.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely used in a variety of fields because of their great potential in representing graph-structured data. However, lacking of rigorous uncertainty estimations limits their application in high-stakes. Conformal Prediction (CP) can produce statistically guaranteed uncertainty estimates by using the classifier's probability estimates to obtain prediction sets, which contains the true class with a user-specified probability. In this paper, we propose a Rank-based CP during training framework to GNNs (RCP-GNN) for reliable uncertainty estimates to enhance the trustworthiness of GNNs in the node classification scenario. By exploiting rank information of the classifier's outcome, prediction sets with desired coverage rate can be efficiently constructed. The strategy of CP during training with differentiable rank-based conformity loss function is further explored to adapt prediction sets according to network topology information. In this way, the composition of prediction sets can be guided by the goal of jointly reducing inefficiency and probability estimation errors. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our model achieves any pre-defined target marginal coverage while significantly reducing the inefficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

> Document retrieval techniques form the foundation for the development of large-scale information systems. The prevailing methodology is to construct a bi-encoder and compute the semantic similarity. However, such scalar similarity is difficult to reflect enough information and impedes our comprehension of the retrieval results. In addition, this computational process mainly emphasizes the global semantics and ignores the fine-grained semantic relationship between the query and the complex text in the document. In this paper, we propose a new method called $\textbf{Ge}$neration $\textbf{A}$ugmented $\textbf{R}$etrieval ($\textbf{GeAR}$) that incorporates well-designed fusion and decoding modules. This enables GeAR to generate the relevant text from documents based on the fused representation of the query and the document, thus learning to "focus on" the fine-grained information. Also when used as a retriever, GeAR does not add any computational burden over bi-encoders. To support the training of the new framework, we have introduced a pipeline to efficiently synthesize high-quality data by utilizing large language models. GeAR exhibits competitive retrieval and localization performance across diverse scenarios and datasets. Moreover, the qualitative analysis and the results generated by GeAR provide novel insights into the interpretation of retrieval results. The code, data, and models will be released after completing technical review to facilitate future research.

> Hybrid action models are widely considered an effective approach to reinforcement learning (RL) modeling. The current mainstream method is to train agents under Parameterized Action Markov Decision Processes (PAMDPs), which performs well in specific environments. Unfortunately, these models either exhibit drastic low learning efficiency in complex PAMDPs or lose crucial information in the conversion between raw space and latent space. To enhance the learning efficiency and asymptotic performance of the agent, we propose a model-based RL (MBRL) algorithm, FLEXplore. FLEXplore learns a parameterized-action-conditioned dynamics model and employs a modified Model Predictive Path Integral control. Unlike conventional MBRL algorithms, we carefully design the dynamics loss function and reward smoothing process to learn a loose yet flexible model. Additionally, we use the variational lower bound to maximize the mutual information between the state and the hybrid action, enhancing the exploration effectiveness of the agent. We theoretically demonstrate that FLEXplore can reduce the regret of the rollout trajectory through the Wasserstein Metric under given Lipschitz conditions. Our empirical results on several standard benchmarks show that FLEXplore has outstanding learning efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to other baselines.

> We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.

> Advances in healthcare research have significantly enhanced our understanding of disease mechanisms, diagnostic precision, and therapeutic options. Yet, lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide due to challenges in early and accurate diagnosis. While current lung cancer detection models show promise, there is considerable potential for further improving the accuracy for timely intervention. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid deep convolution model leveraging transfer learning, named the Maximum Sensitivity Neural Network (MSNN). MSNN is designed to improve the precision of lung cancer detection by refining sensitivity and specificity. This model has surpassed existing deep learning approaches through experimental validation, achieving an accuracy of 98% and a sensitivity of 97%. By overlaying sensitivity maps onto lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans, it enables the visualization of regions most indicative of malignant or benign classifications. This innovative method demonstrates exceptional performance in distinguishing lung cancer with minimal false positives, thereby enhancing the accuracy of medical diagnoses.

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown promise in medical image semantic segmentation (MISS) by capturing long-range correlations. However, ViTs often struggle to model local spatial information effectively, which is essential for accurately segmenting fine anatomical details, particularly when applied to small datasets without extensive pre-training. We introduce Gabor and Laplacian of Gaussian Convolutional Swin Network (GLoG-CSUnet), a novel architecture enhancing Transformer-based models by incorporating learnable radiomic features. This approach integrates dynamically adaptive Gabor and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters to capture texture, edge, and boundary information, enhancing the feature representation processed by the Transformer model. Our method uniquely combines the long-range dependency modeling of Transformers with the texture analysis capabilities of Gabor and LoG features. Evaluated on the Synapse multi-organ and ACDC cardiac segmentation datasets, GLoG-CSUnet demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models, achieving a 1.14\% increase in Dice score for Synapse and 0.99\% for ACDC, with minimal computational overhead (only 15 and 30 additional parameters, respectively). GLoG-CSUnet's flexible design allows integration with various base models, offering a promising approach for incorporating radiomics-inspired feature extraction in Transformer architectures for medical image analysis. The code implementation is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/HAAIL/GLoG-CSUnet.

> The rise of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has significantly improved automated code generation, enhancing software development efficiency. However, this introduces challenges in academia, particularly in distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated code, which complicates issues of academic integrity. Existing detection methods, such as pre-trained models and watermarking, face limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method using 2D token probability maps combined with vision models, preserving spatial code structures such as indentation and brackets. By transforming code into log probability matrices and applying vision models like Vision Transformers (ViT) and ResNet, we capture both content and structure for more accurate detection. Our method shows robustness across multiple programming languages and improves upon traditional detectors, offering a scalable and computationally efficient solution for identifying LLM-generated code.

- `2501.02790v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02790v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02790v1)

> Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been widely adopted to align language models (LMs) with human preference. Prior RLHF works typically take a bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing a segment-level reward model, which assigns a reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over a short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method.

> Greedy algorithms, particularly the orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA), have proven effective in training shallow neural networks for fitting functions and solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we extend the application of OGA to the tasks of linear operator learning, which is equivalent to learning the kernel function through integral transforms. Firstly, a novel greedy algorithm is developed for kernel estimation rate in a new semi-inner product, which can be utilized to approximate the Green's function of linear PDEs from data. Secondly, we introduce the OGA for point-wise kernel estimation to further improve the approximation rate, achieving orders of accuracy improvement across various tasks and baseline models. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis on the kernel estimation problem and the optimal approximation rates for both algorithms, establishing their efficacy and potential for future applications in PDEs and operator learning tasks.

> Group fairness requires that different protected groups, characterized by a given sensitive attribute, receive equal outcomes overall. Typically, the level of group fairness is measured by the statistical gap between predictions from different protected groups. In this study, we reveal an implicit property of existing group fairness measures, which provides an insight into how the group-fair models behave. Then, we develop a new group-fair constraint based on this implicit property to learn group-fair models. To do so, we first introduce a notable theoretical observation: every group-fair model has an implicitly corresponding transport map between the input spaces of each protected group. Based on this observation, we introduce a new group fairness measure termed Matched Demographic Parity (MDP), which quantifies the averaged gap between predictions of two individuals (from different protected groups) matched by a given transport map. Then, we prove that any transport map can be used in MDP to learn group-fair models, and develop a novel algorithm called Fairness Through Matching (FTM), which learns a group-fair model using MDP constraint with an user-specified transport map. We specifically propose two favorable types of transport maps for MDP, based on the optimal transport theory, and discuss their advantages. Experiments reveal that FTM successfully trains group-fair models with certain desirable properties by choosing the transport map accordingly.

> Cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) have emerged in many applications over recent decades, requiring increased attention to security concerns. The rise of sophisticated threats like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) makes ensuring security in CPSSs particularly challenging. Provenance graph analysis has proven effective for tracing and detecting anomalies within systems, but the sheer size and complexity of these graphs hinder the efficiency of existing methods, especially those relying on graph neural networks (GNNs). To address these challenges, we present GraphDART, a modular framework designed to distill provenance graphs into compact yet informative representations, enabling scalable and effective anomaly detection. GraphDART can take advantage of diverse graph distillation techniques, including classic and modern graph distillation methods, to condense large provenance graphs while preserving essential structural and contextual information. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead, allowing GNNs to learn from distilled graphs efficiently and enhance detection performance. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the robustness of GraphDART in detecting malicious activities across cyber-physical-social systems. By optimizing computational efficiency, GraphDART provides a scalable and practical solution to safeguard interconnected environments against APTs.

> Large transformers have demonstrated remarkable success, making it necessary to compress these models to reduce inference costs while preserving their perfor-mance. Current compression algorithms prune transformers at fixed compression ratios, requiring a unique pruning process for each ratio, which results in high computational costs. In contrast, we propose pruning of pretrained transformers at any desired ratio within a single pruning stage, based on a differential inclusion for a mask parameter. This dynamic can generate the whole regularization solution path of the mask parameter, whose support set identifies the network structure. Therefore, the solution path identifies a Transformer weight family with various sparsity levels, offering greater flexibility and customization. In this paper, we introduce such an effective pruning method, termed SPP (Solution Path Pruning). To achieve effective pruning, we segment the transformers into paired modules, including query-key pairs, value-projection pairs, and sequential linear layers, and apply low-rank compression to these pairs, maintaining the output structure while enabling structural compression within the inner states. Extensive experiments conducted on various well-known transformer backbones have demonstrated the efficacy of SPP.

> Retinal image registration is vital for diagnostic therapeutic applications within the field of ophthalmology. Existing public datasets, focusing on adult retinal pathologies with high-quality images, have limited number of image pairs and neglect clinical challenges. To address this gap, we introduce COph100, a novel and challenging dataset known as the Comprehensive Ophthalmology Retinal Image Registration dataset for infants with a wide range of image quality issues constituting the public "RIDIRP" database. COph100 consists of 100 eyes, each with 2 to 9 examination sessions, amounting to a total of 491 image pairs carefully selected from the publicly available dataset. We manually labeled the corresponding ground truth image points and provided automatic vessel segmentation masks for each image. We have assessed COph100 in terms of image quality and registration outcomes using state-of-the-art algorithms. This resource enables a robust comparison of retinal registration methodologies and aids in the analysis of disease progression in infants, thereby deepening our understanding of pediatric ophthalmic conditions.

In this paper, we first formalize hierarchical risk and coverage, and introduce hierarchical risk-coverage curves. Next, we develop algorithms for hierarchical selective classification (which we refer to as "inference rules"), and propose an efficient algorithm that guarantees a target accuracy constraint with high probability. Lastly, we conduct extensive empirical studies on over a thousand ImageNet classifiers, revealing that training regimes such as CLIP, pretraining on ImageNet21k and knowledge distillation boost hierarchical selective performance.

Our approach addresses the challenges of data limitations, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns associated with medical images. By conditioning the diffusion model on segmentation masks-binary masks that represent abnormal areas-Polyp-DDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality (achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 78.47, compared to scores above 83.79) and segmentation performance (achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.7156, versus less than 0.6694 for synthetic images from baseline models and 0.7067 for real data).

> The Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations (MRGE) describe the motion of a finite-sized, spherical particle in a fluid. Because of wake effects, the force acting on a particle depends on its past trajectory. This is modelled by an integral term in the MRGE, also called Basset force, that makes its numerical solution challenging and memory intensive. A recent approach proposed by Prasath et al. exploits connections between the integral term and fractional derivatives to reformulate the MRGE as a time-dependent partial differential equation on a semi-infinite pseudo-space. They also propose a numerical algorithm based on polynomial expansions. This paper develops a numerical approach based on finite difference instead, by adopting techniques by Koleva et al. and Fazio et al. to cope with the issues of having an unbounded spatial domain. We compare convergence order and computational efficiency for particles of varying size and density of the polynomial expansion by Prasath et al., our finite difference schemes and a direct integrator for the MRGE based on multi-step methods proposed by Daitche. While all methods achieve their theoretical convergence order for neutrally buoyant particles with zero initial relative velocity, they suffer from various degrees of order reduction if the initial relative velocity is non-zero or the particle has a different density than the fluid.

> Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have demonstrated superiority in graph-based learning tasks. However, training GCNs on full graphs is particularly challenging, due to the following two challenges: (1) the associated feature tensors can easily explode the memory and block the communication bandwidth of modern accelerators, and (2) the computation workflow in training GCNs alternates between sparse and dense matrix operations, complicating the efficient utilization of computational resources. Existing solutions for scalable distributed full-graph GCN training mostly adopt partition parallelism, which is unsatisfactory as they only partially address the first challenge while incurring scaled-out communication volume. To this end, we propose MixGCN aiming to simultaneously address both the aforementioned challenges towards GCN training. To tackle the first challenge, MixGCN integrates mixture of parallelism. Both theoretical and empirical analysis verify its constant communication volumes and enhanced balanced workload; For handling the second challenge, we consider mixture of accelerators (i.e., sparse and dense accelerators) with a dedicated accelerator for GCN training and a fine-grain pipeline. Extensive experiments show that MixGCN achieves boosted training efficiency and scalability.

> Visual information has been introduced for enhancing machine translation (MT), and its effectiveness heavily relies on the availability of large amounts of bilingual parallel sentence pairs with manual image annotations. In this paper, we introduce a stable diffusion-based imagination network into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to explicitly generate an image for each source sentence, thereby advancing the multimodel MT. Particularly, we build heuristic human feedback with reinforcement learning to ensure the consistency of the generated image with the source sentence without the supervision of image annotation, which breaks the bottleneck of using visual information in MT. Furthermore, the proposed method enables imaginative visual information to be integrated into large-scale text-only MT in addition to multimodal MT. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms existing multimodal MT and text-only MT, especially achieving an average improvement of more than 14 BLEU points on Multi30K multimodal MT benchmarks.

> With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems, widespread sensor deployment has become essential. However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.

> A promising tool for addressing fake news detection is Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most existing GNN-based methods rely on binary classification, categorizing news as either real or fake. Additionally, traditional GNN models use a static neighborhood for each node, making them susceptible to issues like over-squashing. In this paper, we introduce a novel model named Decision-based Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (DHGAT) for fake news detection in a semi-supervised setting. DHGAT effectively addresses the limitations of traditional GNNs by dynamically optimizing and selecting the neighborhood type for each node in every layer. It represents news data as a heterogeneous graph where nodes (news items) are connected by various types of edges. The architecture of DHGAT consists of a decision network that determines the optimal neighborhood type and a representation network that updates node embeddings based on this selection. As a result, each node learns an optimal and task-specific computational graph, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of the fake news detection process. We evaluate DHGAT on the LIAR dataset, a large and challenging dataset for multi-class fake news detection, which includes news items categorized into six classes. Our results demonstrate that DHGAT outperforms existing methods, improving accuracy by approximately 4% and showing robustness with limited labeled data.

> In the Hong Kong Observatory, the Analogue Forecast System (AFS) for precipitation has been providing useful reference in predicting possible daily rainfall scenarios for the next 9 days, by identifying historical cases with similar weather patterns to the latest output from the deterministic model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Recent advances in machine learning allow more sophisticated models to be trained using historical data and the patterns of high-impact weather events to be represented more effectively. As such, an enhanced AFS has been developed using the deep learning technique autoencoder. The datasets of the fifth generation of the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA5) are utilised where more meteorological elements in higher horizontal, vertical and temporal resolutions are available as compared to the previous ECMWF reanalysis products used in the existing AFS. The enhanced AFS features four major steps in generating the daily rain class forecasts: (1) preprocessing of gridded ERA5 and ECMWF model forecast, (2) feature extraction by the pretrained autoencoder, (3) application of optimised feature weightings based on historical cases, and (4) calculation of the final rain class from a weighted ensemble of top analogues. The enhanced AFS demonstrates a consistent and superior performance over the existing AFS, especially in capturing heavy rain cases, during the verification period from 2019 to 2022. This paper presents the detailed formulation of the enhanced AFS and discusses its advantages and limitations in supporting precipitation forecasting in Hong Kong.

> Developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent often involves identifying values for numerous parameters, covering the policy, reward function, environment, and agent-internal architecture. Since these parameters are interrelated in complex ways, optimizing them is a black-box problem that proves especially challenging for nonexperts. Although existing optimization-as-a-service platforms (e.g., Vizier and Optuna) can handle such problems, they are impractical for RL systems, since the need for manual user mapping of each parameter to distinct components makes the effort cumbersome. It also requires understanding of the optimization process, limiting the systems' application beyond the machine learning field and restricting access in areas such as cognitive science, which models human decision-making. To tackle these challenges, the paper presents \name, a flexible low-code platform to optimize any parameter set across an RL system. Available at https://github.com/feferna/AgentForge, it allows an optimization problem to be defined in a few lines of code and handed to any of the interfaced optimizers. With AgentForge, the user can optimize the parameters either individually or jointly. The paper presents an evaluation of its performance for a challenging vision-based RL problem.

- *Jiawei Liu, Fanrui Zhang, Jiaying Zhu, Esther Sun, Qiang Zhang, Zheng-Jun Zha*

- `2410.10238v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10238v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10238v2)

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT4o, have shown strong capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation. However, despite these strengths, they face significant challenges in the increasingly critical task of Image Forgery Detection and Localization (IFDL). Moreover, existing IFDL methods are typically limited to the learning of low-level semantic-agnostic clues and merely provide a single outcome judgment. To tackle these issues, we propose ForgeryGPT, a novel framework that advances the IFDL task by capturing high-order forensics knowledge correlations of forged images from diverse linguistic feature spaces, while enabling explainable generation and interactive dialogue through a newly customized Large Language Model (LLM) architecture. Specifically, ForgeryGPT enhances traditional LLMs by integrating the Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor, which enables the excavating of precise forgery mask information from input images and facilitating pixel-level understanding of tampering artifacts. The Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor consists of a Forgery Localization Expert (FL-Expert) and a Mask Encoder, where the FL-Expert is augmented with an Object-agnostic Forgery Prompt and a Vocabulary-enhanced Vision Encoder, allowing for effectively capturing of multi-scale fine-grained forgery details. To enhance its performance, we implement a three-stage training strategy, supported by our designed Mask-Text Alignment and IFDL Task-Specific Instruction Tuning datasets, which align vision-language modalities and improve forgery detection and instruction-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.

> Anesthetics are crucial in surgical procedures and therapeutic interventions, but they come with side effects and varying levels of effectiveness, calling for novel anesthetic agents that offer more precise and controllable effects. Targeting Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, the primary inhibitory receptors in the central nervous system, could enhance their inhibitory action, potentially reducing side effects while improving the potency of anesthetics. In this study, we introduce a proteomic learning of GABA receptor-mediated anesthesia based on 24 GABA receptor subtypes by considering over 4000 proteins in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and over 1.5 millions known binding compounds. We develop a corresponding drug-target interaction network to identify potential lead compounds for novel anesthetic design. To ensure robust proteomic learning predictions, we curated a dataset comprising 136 targets from a pool of 980 targets within the PPI networks. We employed three machine learning algorithms, integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP) models such as pretrained transformer and autoencoder embeddings. Through a comprehensive screening process, we evaluated the side effects and repurposing potential of over 180,000 drug candidates targeting the GABRA5 receptor. Additionally, we assessed the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of these candidates to identify those with near-optimal characteristics. This approach also involved optimizing the structures of existing anesthetics. Our work presents an innovative strategy for the development of new anesthetic drugs, optimization of anesthetic use, and deeper understanding of potential anesthesia-related side effects.

> Can LLMs pick up language structure from examples? Evidence in prior work seems to indicate yes, as pretrained models repeatedly demonstrate the ability to adapt to new language structures and vocabularies. However, this line of research typically considers languages that are present within common pretraining datasets, or otherwise share notable similarities with these seen languages. In contrast, in this work we attempt to measure models' language understanding capacity while circumventing the risk of dataset recall. We parameterize large families of language tasks recognized by deterministic finite automata (DFAs), and can thus sample novel language reasoning problems to fairly evaulate LLMs regardless of training data. We find that, even in the strikingly simple setting of 3-state DFAs, LLMs underperform unparameterized ngram models on both language recognition and synthesis tasks. These results suggest that LLMs struggle to match the ability of basic language models in recognizing and reasoning over languages that are sufficiently distinct from the ones they see at training time, underscoring the distinction between learning individual languages and possessing a general theory of language.

> Foundation Models (FMs) have become essential components in modern software systems, excelling in tasks such as pattern recognition and unstructured data processing. However, their capabilities are complemented by the precision, verifiability, and deterministic nature of executable specifications, such as symbolic programs. This paper explores a new perspective on computation offloading, proposing a framework that strategically distributes computational tasks between FMs and executable specifications based on their respective strengths. We discuss the potential design of an infrastructure software framework to enable this offloading, focusing on key mechanisms such as task decomposition, resource allocation, and adaptive optimization. Furthermore, we identify critical technical challenges, including semantic-gap resolution, reliability, and scalability, that must be addressed to realize this approach. By leveraging the complementary strengths of FMs and symbolic programs, this perspective lays the groundwork for advancing hybrid software systems that are both efficient and reliable.

> As a cornerstone of blockchain technology in the 3.0 era, smart contracts play a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchain systems. In order to address the limitations of existing smart contract vulnerability detection models with regard to their generalisation capability, an AF-STip smart contract vulnerability detection framework incorporating efficient knowledge migration is proposed. AF-STip employs the teacher network as the main model and migrates the knowledge processed by the smart contract to the student model using a data-free knowledge distillation method. The student model utilises this knowledge to enhance its vulnerability detection capabilities. The approach markedly enhances the model's capacity for feature extraction and cross-class adaptation, while concurrently reducing computational overhead.In order to further enhance the extraction of vulnerability features, an adaptive fusion module is proposed in this paper, which aims to strengthen the interaction and fusion of feature information.The experimental results demonstrate that the STip model attains an average F1 value detection score of 91.16% for the four vulnerabilities without disclosing the original smart contract data. To validate the viability of the proposed lightweight migration approach, the student model is deployed in a migration learning task targeting a novel vulnerability type, resulting in an accuracy of 91.02% and an F1 score of 90.46%. To the best of our knowledge, AF-STip is the inaugural model to apply data-free knowledge migration to smart contract vulnerability detection. While markedly reducing the computational overhead, the method still demonstrates exceptional performance in detecting novel vulnerabilities.

- `2501.03291v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03291v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03291v1)

> Prompt Tuning (PT) enables the adaptation of Pre-trained Large Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks by optimizing a small amount of soft virtual tokens, which are prepended to the input token embeddings. Recently, Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT) has demonstrated superior adaptation capabilities by decomposing the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices. The product of the pair of low-rank matrices is added to the input token embeddings to offset them. Additionally, DePT achieves faster inference compared to PT due to the shorter soft prompt. However, in this paper, we find that the position-based token embedding offsets of DePT restricts its ability to generalize across diverse model inputs, and that the shared embedding offsets across many token embeddings result in sub-optimization. To tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{De}composed \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (ADePT), which is composed of a short soft prompt and a shallow token-shared feed-forward neural network. ADePT utilizes the token-shared feed-forward neural network to learn the embedding offsets for each token, enabling adaptive embedding offsets that vary according to the model input and better optimization of token embedding offsets. This enables ADePT to achieve superior adaptation performance without requiring more inference time or additional trainable parameters compared to vanilla PT and its variants. In comprehensive experiments across 23 natural language processing (NLP) tasks and 4 typical PLMs of different scales, we show that ADePT consistently surpasses the leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, and even outperforms the full fine-tuning baseline in certain scenarios.

> Theoretical guarantees for the robust solution of inverse problems have important implications for applications. To achieve both guarantees and high reconstruction quality, we propose learning a pixel-based ridge regularizer with a data-dependent and spatially varying regularization strength. For this architecture, we establish the existence of solutions to the associated variational problem and the stability of its solution operator. Further, we prove that the reconstruction forms a maximum-a-posteriori approach. Simulations for biomedical imaging and material sciences demonstrate that the approach yields high-quality reconstructions even if only a small instance-specific training set is available.

> Federated learning (FL) has attracted considerable interest in the medical domain due to its capacity to facilitate collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy. However, conventional FL methods typically necessitate multiple communication rounds, leading to significant communication overhead and delays, especially in environments with limited bandwidth. One-shot federated learning addresses these issues by conducting model training and aggregation in a single communication round, thereby reducing communication costs while preserving privacy. Among these, one-shot federated ensemble learning combines independently trained client models using ensemble techniques such as voting, further boosting performance in non-IID data scenarios. On the other hand, existing machine learning methods in healthcare predominantly use unimodal data (e.g., medical images or textual reports), which restricts their diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness. Therefore, the integration of multi-modal data is proposed to address these shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce FedMME, an innovative one-shot multi-modal federated ensemble learning framework that utilizes multi-modal data for medical image analysis. Specifically, FedMME capitalizes on vision large language models to produce textual reports from medical images, employs a BERT model to extract textual features from these reports, and amalgamates these features with visual features to improve diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that our method demonstrated superior performance compared to existing one-shot federated learning methods in healthcare scenarios across four datasets with various data distributions. For instance, it surpasses existing one-shot federated learning approaches by more than 17.5% in accuracy on the RSNA dataset when applying a Dirichlet distribution with ($\alpha$ = 0.3).

> In this paper, we present an enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panel detection approach using satellite images. We propose to use pre-trained CNN-based model to extract the local convolutional features of rooftops. These local features are then combined using the Vectors of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) technique to obtain rooftop-level global features, which are then used to train traditional Machine Learning (ML) models to identify rooftop images that do and do not contain PV panels. On the dataset used in this study, the proposed approach achieved rooftop-PV classification scores exceeding the predefined threshold of 0.9 across all three cities for each of the feature extractor networks evaluated. Moreover, we propose a 3-phase approach to enable efficient utilization of the previously trained models on a new city or region with limited labelled data. We illustrate the effectiveness of this 3-phase approach for multi-city rooftop-PV detection task.

> The chapter discusses the foundational impact of modern generative AI models on information access (IA) systems. In contrast to traditional AI, the large-scale training and superior data modeling of generative AI models enable them to produce high-quality, human-like responses, which brings brand new opportunities for the development of IA paradigms. In this chapter, we identify and introduce two of them in details, i.e., information generation and information synthesis. Information generation allows AI to create tailored content addressing user needs directly, enhancing user experience with immediate, relevant outputs. Information synthesis leverages the ability of generative AI to integrate and reorganize existing information, providing grounded responses and mitigating issues like model hallucination, which is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring precision and external knowledge. This chapter delves into the foundational aspects of generative models, including architecture, scaling, and training, and discusses their applications in multi-modal scenarios. Additionally, it examines the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm and other methods for corpus modeling and understanding, demonstrating how generative AI can enhance information access systems. It also summarizes potential challenges and fruitful directions for future studies.

> As the homogenization of Web services becomes more and more common, the difficulty of service recommendation is gradually increasing. How to predict Quality of Service (QoS) more efficiently and accurately becomes an important challenge for service recommendation. Considering the excellent role of reputation and deep learning (DL) techniques in the field of QoS prediction, we propose a reputation and DL based QoS prediction network, RAHN, which contains the Reputation Calculation Module (RCM), the Latent Feature Extraction Module (LFEM), and the QoS Prediction Hourglass Network (QPHN). RCM obtains the user reputation and the service reputation by using a clustering algorithm and a Logit model. LFEM extracts latent features from known information to form an initial latent feature vector. QPHN aggregates latent feature vectors with different scales by using Attention Mechanism, and can be stacked multiple times to obtain the final latent feature vector for prediction. We evaluate RAHN on a real QoS dataset. The experimental results show that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of RAHN are smaller than the six baseline methods.

> Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing, pivotal to various applications such as query optimization, data integration, and schema matching. While neural network-based models, such as CNN and BERT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in text classification, their effectiveness heavily relies on abundant labeled training data. This dependency makes these models less effective in dynamic few-shot text classification, where labeled data is scarce, and target labels frequently evolve based on application needs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their extensive pretraining and contextual understanding. Current approaches provide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side information (e.g., descriptions) to predict text labels. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced through side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for dynamic few-shot text classification. GORAG constructs and maintains an adaptive information graph by extracting side information across all target texts, rather than treating each input independently. It employs a weighted edge mechanism to prioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and dynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree tailored for each text input. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GORAG outperforms existing approaches by providing more comprehensive and accurate contextual information.

> In-Context Learning (ICL) is a technique by which language models make predictions based on examples provided in their input context. Previously, their context window size imposed a limit on the number of examples that can be shown, making example selection techniques crucial for identifying the maximally effective set of examples. However, the recent advent of Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) has significantly increased the number of examples that can be included in context, raising an important question of whether ICL performance in a many-shot regime is still sensitive to the method of sample selection. To answer this, we revisit these approaches in the context of LCLMs through extensive experiments on 18 datasets spanning 4 tasks. Surprisingly, we observe that sophisticated example selection techniques do not yield significant improvements over a simple random sample selection method. Instead, we find that the advent of LCLMs has fundamentally shifted the challenge of ICL from that of selecting the most effective examples to that of collecting sufficient examples to fill the context window. Specifically, in certain datasets, including all available examples does not fully utilize the context window; however, by augmenting the examples in context with a simple data augmentation approach, we substantially improve ICL performance by 5%.

> In the domain of multi-objective optimization, evolutionary algorithms are distinguished by their capability to generate a diverse population of solutions that navigate the trade-offs inherent among competing objectives. This has catalyzed the ascension of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) as a prevalent approach. Despite the effectiveness of the EMO paradigm, the analysis of resultant solution sets presents considerable challenges. This is primarily attributed to the high-dimensional nature of the data and the constraints imposed by static visualization methods, which frequently culminate in visual clutter and impede interactive exploratory analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ParetoLens, a visual analytics framework specifically tailored to enhance the inspection and exploration of solution sets derived from the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Utilizing a modularized, algorithm-agnostic design, ParetoLens enables a detailed inspection of solution distributions in both decision and objective spaces through a suite of interactive visual representations. This approach not only mitigates the issues associated with static visualizations but also supports a more nuanced and flexible analysis process. The usability of the framework is evaluated through case studies and expert interviews, demonstrating its potential to uncover complex patterns and facilitate a deeper understanding of multi-objective optimization solution sets. A demo website of ParetoLens is available at https://dva-lab.org/paretolens/.

> Label noise, which refers to the mislabeling of instances in a dataset, can significantly impair classifier performance, increase model complexity, and affect feature selection. While most research has concentrated on deep neural networks for image and text data, this study explores the impact of label noise on gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs), the leading algorithm for tabular data. This research fills a gap by examining the robustness of GBDTs to label noise, focusing on adapting two noise detection methods from deep learning for use with GBDTs and introducing a new detection method called Gradients. Additionally, we extend a method initially designed for GBDTs to incorporate relabeling. By using diverse datasets such as Covertype and Breast Cancer, we systematically introduce varying levels of label noise and evaluate the effectiveness of early stopping and noise detection methods in maintaining model performance. Our noise detection methods achieve state-of-the-art results, with a noise detection accuracy above 99% on the Adult dataset across all noise levels. This work enhances the understanding of label noise in GBDTs and provides a foundation for future research in noise detection and correction methods.

> The need for higher power density in electrical machines require better cooling strategies. Spray cooling is a very promising and relatively simple technology to apply, but involves extremely complicated physics. In this paper, a quasi-3D thermal finite-element model of a stator winding is created, by extrusion of a 2D cross-sectional finite-element model along the winding direction. The possible effects of spray cooling are simulated as a heat flux using an impedance boundary condition at the surface of the winding overhang. The results confirm the beneficial performance of spray cooling. The model indicates that spray cooling may allow a ten times larger power density than for standard air- or water-cooled machines.

We adopt a model architecture based on a decoder-only transformer with a multi-scale hierarchy, and design a range-melody decoupled pitch representation that enables text-conditioned vocal range control while keeping melodic accuracy. Furthermore, we explore various experiment settings, including different types of text representations, text encoder fine-tuning, and introducing speech data to alleviate data scarcity, aiming to facilitate further research.

> Recent successes in self-supervised learning (SSL) model spatial co-occurrences of visual features either by masking portions of an image or by aggressively cropping it. Here, we propose a new way to model spatial co-occurrences by aligning local representations (before pooling) with a global image representation. We present CO-SSL, a family of instance discrimination methods and show that it outperforms previous methods on several datasets, including ImageNet-1K where it achieves 71.5% of Top-1 accuracy with 100 pre-training epochs. CO-SSL is also more robust to noise corruption, internal corruption, small adversarial attacks, and large training crop sizes. Our analysis further indicates that CO-SSL learns highly redundant local representations, which offers an explanation for its robustness. Overall, our work suggests that aligning local and global representations may be a powerful principle of unsupervised category learning.

> Navigating mobile User Interface (UI) applications using large language and vision models based on high-level goal instructions is emerging as an important research field with significant practical implications, such as digital assistants and automated UI testing. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing models in mobile UI navigation, benchmarks are required and widely used in the literature. Although multiple benchmarks have been recently established for evaluating functional correctness being judged as pass or fail, they fail to address the need for multi-dimensional evaluation of the entire UI navigation process. Furthermore, other exiting related datasets lack an automated and robust benchmarking suite, making the evaluation process labor-intensive and error-prone. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new benchmark named Sphinx for multi-dimensional evaluation of existing models in practical UI navigation. Sphinx provides a fully automated benchmarking suite that enables reproducibility across real-world mobile apps and employs reliable evaluators to assess model progress. In addition to functional correctness, Sphinx includes comprehensive toolkits for multi-dimensional evaluation, such as invariant-based verification, knowledge probing, and knowledge-augmented generation to evaluate model capabilities including goal understanding, knowledge and planning, grounding, and instruction following, ensuring a thorough assessment of each sub-process in mobile UI navigation. We benchmark 8 large language and multi-modal models with 13 different configurations on Sphinx. Evaluation results show that all these models struggle on Sphinx, and fail on all test generation tasks. Our further analysis of the multi-dimensional evaluation results underscores the current progress and highlights future research directions to improve a model's effectiveness for mobile UI navigation.

> In this paper, we propose a Vision-Audio-Language Omni-peRception pretraining model (VALOR) for multi-modal understanding and generation. Different from widely-studied vision-language pretraining models, VALOR jointly models relationships of vision, audio and language in an end-to-end manner. It contains three separate encoders for single modality representations, and a decoder for multimodal conditional text generation. We design two pretext tasks to pretrain VALOR model, including Multimodal Grouping Alignment (MGA) and Multimodal Grouping Captioning (MGC). MGA projects vision, language and audio to the same common space, building vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language alignment simultaneously. MGC learns how to generate text tokens in conditions of vision, audio or their both. To promote vision-audio-language pretraining research, we construct a large-scale high-quality tri-modality dataset named VALOR-1M, which contains 1M audiable videos with human annotated audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments show that VALOR can learn strong multimodal correlations and be generalized to various downstream tasks (e.g., retrieval, captioning and question answering), with different input modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language). VALOR achieves new state-of-the-art performances on series of public cross-modality benchmarks. Code and data are available at project page https://casia-iva-group.github.io/projects/VALOR.

> Mutation testing may be used to guide test case generation and as a technique to assess the quality of test suites. Despite being used frequently, mutation testing is not so commonly applied in the mobile world. One critical challenge in mutation testing is dealing with its computational cost. Generating mutants, running test cases over each mutant, and analyzing the results may require significant time and resources. This research aims to contribute to reducing Android mutation testing costs. It implements mutation testing operators (traditional and Android-specific) according to mutant schemata (implementing multiple mutants into a single code file). It also describes an Android mutation testing framework developed to execute test cases and determine mutation scores. Additional mutation operators can be implemented in JavaScript and easily integrated into the framework. The overall approach is validated through case studies showing that mutant schemata have advantages over the traditional mutation strategy (one file per mutant). The results show mutant schemata overcome traditional mutation in all evaluated aspects with no additional cost: it takes 8.50% less time for mutant generation, requires 99.78% less disk space, and runs, on average, 6.45% faster than traditional mutation. Moreover, considering sustainability metrics, mutant schemata have 8,18% less carbon footprint than traditional strategy.

> Inverse problems are prevalent across various disciplines in science and engineering. In the field of computer vision, tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution are commonly formulated as inverse problems. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a promising approach for addressing noisy linear inverse problems, offering effective solutions without requiring additional task-specific training. Specifically, with the prior provided by DMs, one can sample from the posterior by finding the likelihood. Since the likelihood is intractable, it is often approximated in the literature. However, this approximation compromises the quality of the generated images. To overcome this limitation and improve the effectiveness of DMs in solving inverse problems, we propose an information-theoretic approach. Specifically, we maximize the conditional mutual information $\mathrm{I}(\boldsymbol{x}_0; \boldsymbol{y} | \boldsymbol{x}_t)$, where $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ represents the reconstructed signal, $\boldsymbol{y}$ is the measurement, and $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ is the intermediate signal at stage $t$. This ensures that the intermediate signals $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ are generated in a way that the final reconstructed signal $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ retains as much information as possible about the measurement $\boldsymbol{y}$. We demonstrate that this method can be seamlessly integrated with recent approaches and, once incorporated, enhances their performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

> Video large language models (Video-LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding videos. However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy visual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context length cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant frames hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial. This paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles: query relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such as uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these principles. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with dynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and model-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the query using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the similarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To incorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each segment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov decision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments. Theoretically, MDP3 provides a \((1 - 1/e)\)-approximate solution to the NP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly outperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.

> Humour styles can have either a negative or a positive impact on well-being. Given the importance of these styles to mental health, significant research has been conducted on their automatic identification. However, the automated machine learning models used for this purpose are black boxes, making their prediction decisions opaque. Clarity and transparency are vital in the field of mental health. This paper presents an explainable AI (XAI) framework for understanding humour style classification, building upon previous work in computational humour analysis. Using the best-performing single model (ALI+XGBoost) from prior research, we apply comprehensive XAI techniques to analyse how linguistic, emotional, and semantic features contribute to humour style classification decisions. Our analysis reveals distinct patterns in how different humour styles are characterised and misclassified, with particular emphasis on the challenges in distinguishing affiliative humour from other styles. Through detailed examination of feature importance, error patterns, and misclassification cases, we identify key factors influencing model decisions, including emotional ambiguity, context misinterpretation, and target identification. The framework demonstrates significant utility in understanding model behaviour, achieving interpretable insights into the complex interplay of features that define different humour styles. Our findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of computational humour analysis and practical applications in mental health, content moderation, and digital humanities research.

> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become essential in clinical diagnosis due to its high resolution and multiple contrast mechanisms. However, the relatively long acquisition time limits its broader application. To address this issue, this study presents an innovative conditional guided diffusion model, named as TC-KANRecon, which incorporates the Multi-Free U-KAN (MF-UKAN) module and a dynamic clipping strategy. TC-KANRecon model aims to accelerate the MRI reconstruction process through deep learning methods while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed images. The MF-UKAN module can effectively balance the tradeoff between image denoising and structure preservation. Specifically, it presents the multi-head attention mechanisms and scalar modulation factors, which significantly enhances the model's robustness and structure preservation capabilities in complex noise environments. Moreover, the dynamic clipping strategy in TC-KANRecon adjusts the cropping interval according to the sampling steps, thereby mitigating image detail loss typicalching the visual features of the images. Furthermore, the MC-Model incorporates full-sampling k-space information, realizing efficient fusion of conditional information, enhancing the model's ability to process complex data, and improving the realism and detail richness of reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other MRI reconstruction methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, TC-KANRecon method exhibits excellent reconstruction results when processing high-noise, low-sampling-rate MRI data. Our source code is available at https://github.com/lcbkmm/TC-KANRecon.

> Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by the architecture and functions of the human brain and have revolutionised the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Inspired by studies on the latent geometry of the brain, in this perspective paper we posit that an increase in the research and application of hyperbolic geometry in ANNs and machine learning will lead to increased accuracy, improved feature space representations and more efficient models across a range of tasks. We examine the structure and functions of the human brain, emphasising the correspondence between its scale-free hierarchical organization and hyperbolic geometry, and reflecting on the central role hyperbolic geometry plays in facilitating human intelligence. Empirical evidence indicates that hyperbolic neural networks outperform Euclidean models for tasks including natural language processing, computer vision and complex network analysis, requiring fewer parameters and exhibiting better generalisation. Despite its nascent adoption, hyperbolic geometry holds promise for improving machine learning models through brain-inspired geometric representations.

> Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function signature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate source code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and assertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected output). However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by four LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are incorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution). To detect incorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature along with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a new approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via LLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a predicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth problem solution). Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a sample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O examples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval). We use the given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that are violated by at least one given I/O example. We then use the remaining postconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate at least one remaining postcondition. Experimental results show that DeCon can detect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and DeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4% in terms of Pass@1. In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct assertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions decreases only slightly.

> Unprecedented agility and dexterous manipulation have been demonstrated with controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (RL), with a significant impact on legged and humanoid robots. Modern tooling and simulation platforms, such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, have been enabling such advances. This article focuses on demonstrating the applications of Isaac in local planning and obstacle avoidance as one of the most fundamental ways in which a mobile robot interacts with its environments. Although there is extensive research on proprioception-based RL policies, the article highlights less standardized and reproducible approaches to exteroception. At the same time, the article aims to provide a base framework for end-to-end local navigation policies and how a custom robot can be trained in such simulation environment. We benchmark end-to-end policies with the state-of-the-art Nav2, navigation stack in Robot Operating System (ROS). We also cover the sim-to-real transfer process by demonstrating zero-shot transferability of policies trained in the Isaac simulator to real-world robots. This is further evidenced by the tests with different simulated robots, which show the generalization of the learned policy. Finally, the benchmarks demonstrate comparable performance to Nav2, opening the door to quick deployment of state-of-the-art end-to-end local planners for custom robot platforms, but importantly furthering the possibilities by expanding the state and action spaces or task definitions for more complex missions. Overall, with this article we introduce the most important steps, and aspects to consider, in deploying RL policies for local path planning and obstacle avoidance with Isaac Sim training, Gazebo testing, and ROS 2 for real-time inference in real robots.

> High-resolution precipitation forecasts are crucial for providing accurate weather prediction and supporting effective responses to extreme weather events. Traditional numerical models struggle with stochastic subgrid-scale processes, while recent deep learning models often produce blurry results. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-inspired deep learning framework for high-resolution (0.05\textdegree{} $\times$ 0.05\textdegree{}) ensemble precipitation forecasting. Trained on ERA5 and CMPA high-resolution precipitation datasets, the framework integrates deterministic and probabilistic components. The deterministic model, based on a 3D SwinTransformer, captures average precipitation at mesoscale resolution and incorporates strategies to enhance performance, particularly for moderate to heavy rainfall. The probabilistic model employs conditional diffusion in latent space to account for uncertainties in residual precipitation at convective scales. During inference, ensemble members are generated by repeatedly sampling latent variables, enabling the model to represent precipitation uncertainty. Our model significantly enhances spatial resolution and forecast accuracy. Rank histogram shows that the ensemble system is reliable and unbiased. In a case study of heavy precipitation in southern China, the model outputs align more closely with observed precipitation distributions than ERA5, demonstrating superior capability in capturing extreme precipitation events. Additionally, 5-day real-time forecasts show good performance in terms of CSI scores.

> While automated audio captioning (AAC) has made notable progress, traditional fully supervised AAC models still face two critical challenges: the need for expensive audio-text pair data for training and performance degradation when transferring across domains. To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a data-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires text-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without additional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone. During training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text encoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with the audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner. To mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection strategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy from the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto a text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the joint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved from a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external knowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability. Conditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar captions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich textual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption datastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new domains in a training-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate that DRCap outperforms all other zero-shot models in in-domain scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain scenarios.

> With the growing interest in on On-orbit servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions, spacecraft poses estimation algorithms are being developed using deep learning to improve the precision of this complex task and find the most efficient solution. With the advances of bio-inspired low-power solutions, such a spiking neural networks and event-based processing and cameras, and their recent work for space applications, we propose to investigate the feasibility of a fully event-based solution to improve event-based pose estimation for spacecraft.

We show the methods and results of the first event-based solution for this use case, where our small spiking end-to-end network (S2E2) solution achieves interesting results over 21cm position error and 14degree rotation error, which is the first step towards fully event-based processing for embedded spacecraft pose estimation.

> Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods allow for gigapixel Whole-Slide Image (WSI) analysis with only slide-level annotations. Interpretability is crucial for safely deploying such algorithms in high-stakes medical domains. Traditional MIL methods offer explanations by highlighting salient regions. However, such spatial heatmaps provide limited insights for end users. To address this, we propose a novel inherently interpretable WSI-classification approach that uses human-understandable pathology concepts to generate explanations. Our proposed Concept MIL model leverages recent advances in vision-language models to directly predict pathology concepts based on image features. The model's predictions are obtained through a linear combination of the concepts identified on the top-K patches of a WSI, enabling inherent explanations by tracing each concept's influence on the prediction. In contrast to traditional concept-based interpretable models, our approach eliminates the need for costly human annotations by leveraging the vision-language model. We validate our method on two widely used pathology datasets: Camelyon16 and PANDA. On both datasets, Concept MIL achieves AUC and accuracy scores over 0.9, putting it on par with state-of-the-art models. We further find that 87.1\% (Camelyon16) and 85.3\% (PANDA) of the top 20 patches fall within the tumor region. A user study shows that the concepts identified by our model align with the concepts used by pathologists, making it a promising strategy for human-interpretable WSI classification.

> Classic algorithms for stochastic bandits typically use hyperparameters that govern their critical properties such as the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Tuning these hyperparameters is a problem of great practical significance. However, this is a challenging problem and in certain cases is information theoretically impossible. To address this challenge, we consider a practically relevant transfer learning setting where one has access to offline data collected from several bandit problems (tasks) coming from an unknown distribution over the tasks. Our aim is to use this offline data to set the hyperparameters for a new task drawn from the unknown distribution. We provide bounds on the inter-task (number of tasks) and intra-task (number of arm pulls for each task) sample complexity for learning near-optimal hyperparameters on unseen tasks drawn from the distribution. Our results apply to several classic algorithms, including tuning the exploration parameters in UCB and LinUCB and the noise parameter in GP-UCB. Our experiments indicate the significance and effectiveness of the transfer of hyperparameters from offline problems in online learning with stochastic bandit feedback.

> Self-attention mechanisms have revolutionised deep learning architectures, but their mathematical foundations remain incompletely understood. We establish that these mechanisms can be formalised through categorical algebra, presenting a framework that focuses on the linear components of self-attention. We prove that the query, key, and value maps in self-attention naturally form a parametric endofunctor in the 2-category $\mathbf{Para}(\mathbf{Vect})$ of parametric morphisms. We show that stacking multiple self-attention layers corresponds to constructing the free monad on this endofunctor. For positional encodings, we demonstrate that strictly additive position embeddings constitute monoid actions on the embedding space, while standard sinusoidal encodings, though not additive, possess a universal property among faithful position-preserving functors. We establish that the linear portions of self-attention exhibit natural equivariance properties with respect to permutations of input tokens. Finally, we prove that the ``circuits'' identified in mechanistic interpretability correspond precisely to compositions of parametric morphisms in our framework. This categorical perspective unifies geometric, algebraic, and interpretability-based approaches to transformer analysis, while making explicit the mathematical structures underlying attention mechanisms. Our treatment focuses exclusively on linear maps, setting aside nonlinearities like softmax and layer normalisation, which require more sophisticated categorical structures. Our results extend recent work on categorical foundations for deep learning while providing insights into the algebraic structure of attention mechanisms.

> In solid-state materials science, substantial efforts have been devoted to the calculation and modeling of the electronic band gap. While a wide range of ab initio methods and machine learning algorithms have been created that can predict this quantity, the development of new computational approaches for studying the band gap remains an active area of research. Here we introduce a simple machine learning model for predicting the band gap using only the chemical composition of the crystalline material. To motivate the form of the model, we first analyze the empirical distribution of the band gap, which sheds new light on its atypical statistics. Specifically, our analysis enables us to frame band gap prediction as a task of modeling a mixed random variable, and we design our model accordingly. Our model formulation incorporates thematic ideas from chemical heuristic models for other material properties in a manner that is suited towards the band gap modeling task. The model has exactly one parameter corresponding to each element, which is fit using data. To predict the band gap for a given material, the model computes a weighted average of the parameters associated with its constituent elements and then takes the maximum of this quantity and zero. The model provides heuristic chemical interpretability by intuitively capturing the associations between the band gap and individual chemical elements.

However, inferring the underlying TDDEs from observed data remains a challenging problem due to the inherent nonlinearity, uncertainty, and noise in real-world systems. Conventional equation discovery methods often exhibit limitations when dealing with large time delays, relying on deterministic techniques or optimization-based approaches that may struggle with scalability and robustness. In this paper, we present BayTiDe - Bayesian Approach for Discovering Time-Delayed Differential Equations from Data, that is capable of identifying arbitrarily large values of time delay to an accuracy that is directly proportional to the resolution of the data input to it. BayTiDe leverages Bayesian inference combined with a sparsity-promoting discontinuous spike-and-slab prior to accurately identify time-delayed differential equations. The approach accommodates arbitrarily large time delays with accuracy proportional to the input data resolution, while efficiently narrowing the search space to achieve significant computational savings. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of BayTiDe through a range of numerical examples, validating its ability to recover delayed differential equations from noisy data.

> Free surface and granular fluid mechanics problems combine the challenges of fluid dynamics with aspects of granular behaviour. This type of problem is particularly relevant in contexts such as the flow of sediments in rivers, the movement of granular soils in reservoirs, or the interactions between a fluid and granular materials in industrial processes such as silos. The numerical simulation of these phenomena is challenging because the solution depends not only on the multiple phases that strongly interact with each other, but also on the need to describe the geometric evolution of the different interfaces. This paper presents an approach to the simulation of fluid-granular phenomena involving strongly deforming free surfaces. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is combined with the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) and the fluid-grain interface is treated by a two-way coupling between the two phases. The fluid-air interface is solved by a free surface model. The geometric and topological variations are therefore naturally provided by the full Lagrangian description of all phases. The approach is validated on benchmark test cases such as two-phase dam failures and then applied to a real landslide problem.

> Inspired by the impact of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on combinatorial optimization, we construct an analogous relax-then-sample strategy for low-rank optimization problems. First, for orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization problems, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and a randomized rounding scheme, which obtains provably near-optimal solutions, mimicking the blueprint from Goemans and Williamson for the Max-Cut problem. We then extend our approach to generic low-rank optimization problems by developing new semidefinite relaxations that are both tighter and more broadly applicable than those in prior works. Although our original proposal introduces large semidefinite matrices as decision variables, we show that most of the blocks in these matrices can be safely omitted without altering the optimal value, hence improving the scalability of our approach. Using several examples (including matrix completion, basis pursuit, and reduced-rank regression), we show how to reduce the size of our relaxation even further. Finally, we numerically illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of our relaxation and our sampling scheme on orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization and matrix completion problems.

> Foundation models have become popular in forecasting due to their ability to make accurate predictions, even with minimal fine-tuning on specific datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate how the newly released regression variant of TabPFN, a general tabular foundation model, can be applied to time series forecasting. We propose a straightforward approach, TabPFN-TS, which pairs TabPFN with simple feature engineering to achieve strong forecasting performance. Despite its simplicity and with only 11M parameters, TabPFN-TS outperforms Chronos-Mini, a model of similar size, and matches or even slightly outperforms Chronos-Large, which has 65-fold more parameters. A key strength of our method lies in its reliance solely on artificial data during pre-training, avoiding the need for large training datasets and eliminating the risk of benchmark contamination.

> Data-driven soft sensors are crucial in predicting key performance indicators in industrial systems. However, current methods predominantly rely on the supervised learning paradigms of parameter updating, which inherently faces challenges such as high development costs, poor robustness, training instability, and lack of interpretability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, notably through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables high-performance task execution with minimal input-label demonstrations and no prior training. This paper aims to replace supervised learning with the emerging ICL paradigm for soft sensor modeling to address existing challenges and explore new avenues for advancement. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Few-shot Uncertainty-aware and self-Explaining Soft Sensor (LLM-FUESS), which includes the Zero-shot Auxiliary Variable Selector (LLM-ZAVS) and the Uncertainty-aware Few-shot Soft Sensor (LLM-UFSS). The LLM-ZAVS retrieves from the Industrial Knowledge Vector Storage to enhance LLMs' domain-specific knowledge, enabling zero-shot auxiliary variable selection. In the LLM-UFSS, we utilize text-based context demonstrations of structured data to prompt LLMs to execute ICL for predicting and propose a context sample retrieval augmentation strategy to improve performance. Additionally, we explored LLMs' AIGC and probabilistic characteristics to propose self-explanation and uncertainty quantification methods for constructing a trustworthy soft sensor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, strong robustness, and flexibility, effectively mitigates training instability found in traditional methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish soft sensor utilizing LLMs.

> Recent advancements in machine learning-based signal analysis, coupled with open data initiatives, have fuelled efforts in automatic sleep stage classification. Despite the proliferation of classification models, few have prioritised reducing model complexity, which is a crucial factor for practical applications. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale and Attention Convolutional Neural Network (MSA-CNN), a lightweight architecture featuring as few as ~10,000 parameters. MSA-CNN leverages a novel multi-scale module employing complementary pooling to eliminate redundant filter parameters and dense convolutions. Model complexity is further reduced by separating temporal and spatial feature extraction and using cost-effective global spatial convolutions. This separation of tasks not only reduces model complexity but also mirrors the approach used by human experts in sleep stage scoring. We evaluated both small and large configurations of MSA-CNN against nine state-of-the-art baseline models across three public datasets, treating univariate and multivariate models separately. Our evaluation, based on repeated cross-validation and re-evaluation of all baseline models, demonstrated that the large MSA-CNN outperformed all baseline models on all three datasets in terms of accuracy and Cohen's kappa, despite its significantly reduced parameter count. Lastly, we explored various model variants and conducted an in-depth analysis of the key modules and techniques, providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. The code for our models, baselines, and evaluation procedures is available at https://github.com/sgoerttler/MSA-CNN.

> Classical models of memory in psychology and neuroscience rely on similarity-based retrieval of stored patterns, where similarity is a function of retrieval cues and the stored patterns. While parsimonious, these models do not allow distinct representations for storage and retrieval, despite their distinct computational demands. Key-value memory systems, in contrast, distinguish representations used for storage (values) and those used for retrieval (keys). This allows key-value memory systems to optimize simultaneously for fidelity in storage and discriminability in retrieval. We review the computational foundations of key-value memory, its role in modern machine learning systems, related ideas from psychology and neuroscience, applications to a number of empirical puzzles, and possible biological implementations.

> Contrastive learning underpins most current self-supervised time series representation methods. The strategy for constructing positive and negative sample pairs significantly affects the final representation quality. However, due to the continuous nature of time series semantics, the modeling approach of contrastive learning struggles to accommodate the characteristics of time series data. This results in issues such as difficulties in constructing hard negative samples and the potential introduction of inappropriate biases during positive sample construction. Although some recent works have developed several scientific strategies for constructing positive and negative sample pairs with improved effectiveness, they remain constrained by the contrastive learning framework. To fundamentally overcome the limitations of contrastive learning, this paper introduces Frequency-masked Embedding Inference (FEI), a novel non-contrastive method that completely eliminates the need for positive and negative samples. The proposed FEI constructs 2 inference branches based on a prompting strategy: 1) Using frequency masking as prompts to infer the embedding representation of the target series with missing frequency bands in the embedding space, and 2) Using the target series as prompts to infer its frequency masking embedding. In this way, FEI enables continuous semantic relationship modeling for time series. Experiments on 8 widely used time series datasets for classification and regression tasks, using linear evaluation and end-to-end fine-tuning, show that FEI significantly outperforms existing contrastive-based methods in terms of generalization. This study provides new insights into self-supervised representation learning for time series. The code is available at https://github.com/USTBInnovationPark/Frequency-masked-Embedding-Inference.

> Recent self-supervised learning (SSL) models trained on human-like egocentric visual inputs substantially underperform on image recognition tasks compared to humans. These models train on raw, uniform visual inputs collected from head-mounted cameras. This is different from humans, as the anatomical structure of the retina and visual cortex relatively amplifies the central visual information, i.e. around humans' gaze location. This selective amplification in humans likely aids in forming object-centered visual representations. Here, we investigate whether focusing on central visual information boosts egocentric visual object learning. We simulate 5-months of egocentric visual experience using the large-scale Ego4D dataset and generate gaze locations with a human gaze prediction model. To account for the importance of central vision in humans, we crop the visual area around the gaze location. Finally, we train a time-based SSL model on these modified inputs. Our experiments demonstrate that focusing on central vision leads to better object-centered representations. Our analysis shows that the SSL model leverages the temporal dynamics of the gaze movements to build stronger visual representations. Overall, our work marks a significant step toward bio-inspired learning of visual representations.

> Spectral Graph Neural Networks effectively handle graphs with different homophily levels, with low-pass filter mining feature smoothness and high-pass filter capturing differences. When these distinct filters could naturally form two opposite views for self-supervised learning, the commonalities between the counterparts for the same node remain unexplored, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, a simple yet effective self-supervised contrastive framework, LOHA, is proposed to address this gap. LOHA optimally leverages low-pass and high-pass views by embracing "harmony in diversity". Rather than solely maximizing the difference between these distinct views, which may lead to feature separation, LOHA harmonizes the diversity by treating the propagation of graph signals from both views as a composite feature. Specifically, a novel high-dimensional feature named spectral signal trend is proposed to serve as the basis for the composite feature, which remains relatively unaffected by changing filters and focuses solely on original feature differences. LOHA achieves an average performance improvement of 2.8% over runner-up models on 9 real-world datasets with varying homophily levels. Notably, LOHA even surpasses fully-supervised models on several datasets, which underscores the potential of LOHA in advancing the efficacy of spectral GNNs for diverse graph structures.

> Existing research on federated learning has been focused on the setting where learning is coordinated by a centralized entity. Yet the greatest potential of future collaborative intelligence would be unleashed in a more open and democratized setting with no central entity in a dominant role, referred to as "decentralized federated learning". New challenges arise accordingly in achieving both correct model training and fair reward allocation with collective effort among all participating nodes, especially with the threat of the Byzantine node jeopardising both tasks.   In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized Byzantine fault-tolerant federated learning framework based on a novel Proof-of-Data (PoD) consensus protocol to resolve both the "trust" and "incentive" components. By decoupling model training and contribution accounting, PoD is able to enjoy not only the benefit of learning efficiency and system liveliness from asynchronous societal-scale PoW-style learning but also the finality of consensus and reward allocation from epoch-based BFT-style voting. To mitigate false reward claims by data forgery from Byzantine attacks, a privacy-aware data verification and contribution-based reward allocation mechanism is designed to complete the framework. Our evaluation results show that PoD demonstrates performance in model training close to that of the centralized counterpart while achieving trust in consensus and fairness for reward allocation with a fault tolerance ratio of 1/3.

> Kernel ridge regression, in general, is expensive in memory allocation and computation time. This paper addresses low rank approximations and surrogates for kernel ridge regression, which bridge these difficulties. The fundamental contribution of the paper is a lower bound on the minimal rank such that the prediction power of the approximation remains reliable. Based on this bound, we demonstrate that the computational cost of the most popular low rank approach, which is the Nystr\"om method, is almost linear in the sample size. This justifies the method from a theoretical point of view. Moreover, the paper provides a significant extension of the feasible choices of the regularization parameter. The result builds on a thorough theoretical analysis of the approximation of elementary kernel functions by elements in the range of the associated integral operator. We provide estimates of the approximation error and characterize the behavior of the norm of the underlying weight function.

> Outlier detection refers to the identification of anomalous samples that deviate significantly from the distribution of normal data and has been extensively studied and used in a variety of practical tasks. However, most unsupervised outlier detection methods are carefully designed to detect specified outliers, while real-world data may be entangled with different types of outliers. In this study, we propose a fuzzy rough sets-based multi-scale outlier detection method to identify various types of outliers. Specifically, a novel fuzzy rough sets-based method that integrates relative fuzzy granule density is first introduced to improve the capability of detecting local outliers. Then, a multi-scale view generation method based on granular-ball computing is proposed to collaboratively identify group outliers at different levels of granularity. Moreover, reliable outliers and inliers determined by the three-way decision are used to train a weighted support vector machine to further improve the performance of outlier detection. The proposed method innovatively transforms unsupervised outlier detection into a semi-supervised classification problem and for the first time explores the fuzzy rough sets-based outlier detection from the perspective of multi-scale granular balls, allowing for high adaptability to different types of outliers. Extensive experiments carried out on both artificial and UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed outlier detection method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, improving the results by at least 8.48% in terms of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) index. { The source codes are released at \url{https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Tan/MGBOD}. }

> The profiled vehicle routing problem (PVRP) is a generalization of the heterogeneous capacitated vehicle routing problem (HCVRP) in which the objective is to optimize the routes of vehicles to serve client demands subject to different vehicle profiles, with each having a preference or constraint on a per-client basis. While existing learning methods have shown promise for solving the HCVRP in real-time, no learning method exists to solve the more practical and challenging PVRP. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Attention Model with Profiles (CAMP), a novel approach that learns efficient solvers for PVRP using multi-agent reinforcement learning. CAMP employs a specialized attention-based encoder architecture to embed profiled client embeddings in parallel for each vehicle profile. We design a communication layer between agents for collaborative decision-making across profiled embeddings at each decoding step and a batched pointer mechanism to attend to the profiled embeddings to evaluate the likelihood of the next actions. We evaluate CAMP on two variants of PVRPs: PVRP with preferences, which explicitly influence the reward function, and PVRP with zone constraints with different numbers of agents and clients, demonstrating that our learned solvers achieve competitive results compared to both classical state-of-the-art neural multi-agent models in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.

> Background and Purpose: Accurate motion tracking in MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is essential for effective treatment delivery. This study aimed to enhance motion tracking precision in MRIgRT through an automatic real-time markerless tracking method using an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework with automatic segmentation. Materials and Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking and segmentation method by integrating the ETLD framework with an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The ETLD framework was upgraded for real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. ICV was used for precise target volume coverage, refining the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. The method was tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases. Results: Evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions showed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects in the Beam Eye View(BEV)/Beam Path View(BPV) orientation. The ETLD+ICV method achieved a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time markerless motion tracking method for MRIgRT that significantly outperforms current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also shows enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, making it an indispensable asset in improving the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.

> The multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) enables arbitrary translations across multiple languages by training a model with limited parameters using parallel data only. However, the performance of such MNMT models still lags behind that of large language models (LLMs), limiting their practicality. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing registering to achieve the new state-of-the-art of decoder-only MNMT models. Specifically, we insert a set of artificial tokens specifying the target language, called registers, into the input sequence between the source and target tokens. By modifying the attention mask, the target token generation only pays attention to the activation of registers, representing the source tokens in the target language space. Experiments on EC-40, a large-scale benchmark, show that our method outperforms related methods driven by optimizing multilingual representations. We further scale up and collect 9.3 billion sentence pairs across 24 languages from public datasets to pre-train two models, namely MITRE (multilingual translation with registers). One of them, MITRE-913M, outperforms NLLB-3.3B, achieves comparable performance with commercial LLMs, and shows strong adaptability in fine-tuning. Finally, we open-source our models to facilitate further research and development in MNMT: https://github.com/zhiqu22/mitre.

> Obtaining dynamic models of continuum soft robots is central to the analysis and control of soft robots, and researchers have devoted much attention to the challenge of proposing both data-driven and first-principle solutions. Both avenues have, however, shown their limitations; the former lacks structure and performs poorly outside training data, while the latter requires significant simplifications and extensive expert knowledge to be used in practice. This paper introduces a streamlined method for learning low-dimensional, physics-based models that are both accurate and easy to interpret. We start with an algorithm that uses image data (i.e., shape evolutions) to determine the minimal necessary segments for describing a soft robot's movement. Following this, we apply a dynamic regression and strain sparsification algorithm to identify relevant strains and define the model's dynamics. We validate our approach through simulations with various planar soft manipulators, comparing its performance against other learning strategies, showing that our models are both computationally efficient and 25x more accurate on out-of-training distribution inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that thanks to the capability of the method of generating physically compatible models, the learned models can be straightforwardly combined with model-based control policies.

> Generating synthetic Computed Tomography (CT) images from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is desirable for improving the image quality of CBCT. Existing synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers often face difficulties in effectively capturing both global and local features and contrasts for high-quality sCT generation. In this work, we propose a Global-Local Feature and Contrast learning (GLFC) framework for sCT generation. First, a Mamba-Enhanced UNet (MEUNet) is introduced by integrating Mamba blocks into the skip connections of a high-resolution UNet for effective global and local feature learning. Second, we propose a Multiple Contrast Loss (MCL) that calculates synthetic loss at different intensity windows to improve quality for both soft tissues and bone regions. Experiments on the SynthRAD2023 dataset demonstrate that GLFC improved the SSIM of sCT from 77.91% to 91.50% compared with the original CBCT, and significantly outperformed several existing methods for sCT generation.

The network architecture and estimation algorithm are carefully designed to handle the challenges of high-dimensional product manifold domains, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality that limits traditional kernel and basis expansion estimators, as well as overcoming the convergence issues encountered by non-specialized neural network methods. Extensive simulations and a real-world application to brain structural connectivity data highlight the clear advantages of our method over the competing alternatives.

> Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial and challenging task. In this study, we focus on auditing black-box LLMs without access to their parameters, only to the provided service. We treat this type of auditing as a black-box optimization problem where the goal is to automatically uncover input-output pairs of the target LLMs that exhibit illegal, immoral, or unsafe behaviors. For instance, we may seek a non-toxic input that the target LLM responds to with a toxic output or an input that induces the hallucinative response from the target LLM containing politically sensitive individuals. This black-box optimization is challenging due to the scarcity of feasible points, the discrete nature of the prompt space, and the large search space. To address these challenges, we propose Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language Models (CALM), which uses intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning to finetune an LLM as the auditor agent to uncover potential harmful and biased input-output pairs of the target LLM. CALM successfully identifies derogatory completions involving celebrities and uncovers inputs that elicit specific names under the black-box setting. This work offers a promising direction for auditing black-box LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/x-zheng16/CALM.git.

> Pronoun translation is a longstanding challenge in neural machine translation (NMT), often requiring inter-sentential context to ensure linguistic accuracy. To address this, we introduce ProNMT, a novel framework designed to enhance pronoun and overall translation quality in context-aware machine translation systems. ProNMT leverages Quality Estimation (QE) models and a unique Pronoun Generation Likelihood-Based Feedback mechanism to iteratively fine-tune pre-trained NMT models without relying on extensive human annotations. The framework combines QE scores with pronoun-specific rewards to guide training, ensuring improved handling of linguistic nuances. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant gains in pronoun translation accuracy and general translation quality across multiple metrics. ProNMT offers an efficient, scalable, and context-aware approach to improving NMT systems, particularly in translating context-dependent elements like pronouns.

> Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized a large variety of NLP tasks. An active debate is to what extent they can do reasoning and planning. Prior work has assessed the latter in the specific context of PDDL planning, based on manually converting three PDDL domains into natural language (NL) prompts. Here we automate this conversion step, showing how to leverage an LLM to automatically generate NL prompts from PDDL input. Our automatically generated NL prompts result in similar LLM-planning performance as the previous manually generated ones. Beyond this, the automation enables us to run much larger experiments, providing for the first time a broad evaluation of LLM planning performance in PDDL.

> Convex functions and their gradients play a critical role in mathematical imaging, from proximal optimization to Optimal Transport. The successes of deep learning has led many to use learning-based methods, where fixed functions or operators are replaced by learned neural networks. Regardless of their empirical superiority, establishing rigorous guarantees for these methods often requires to impose structural constraints on neural architectures, in particular convexity. The most popular way to do so is to use so-called Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs). In order to explore the expressivity of ICNNs, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a ReLU neural network to be convex. Such characterizations are based on product of weights and activations, and write nicely for any architecture in the path-lifting framework. As particular applications, we study our characterizations in depth for 1 and 2-hidden-layer neural networks: we show that every convex function implemented by a 1-hidden-layer ReLU network can be also expressed by an ICNN with the same architecture; however this property no longer holds with more layers. Finally, we provide a numerical procedure that allows an exact check of convexity for ReLU neural networks with a large number of affine regions.

> The rapidly developing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown notable capabilities on a range of multi-modal tasks, but still face the hallucination phenomena where the generated texts do not align with the given contexts, significantly restricting the usages of LVLMs. Most previous work detects and mitigates hallucination at the coarse-grained level or requires expensive annotation (e.g., labeling by proprietary models or human experts). To address these issues, we propose detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs via fine-grained AI feedback. The basic idea is that we generate a small-size sentence-level hallucination annotation dataset by proprietary models, whereby we train a hallucination detection model which can perform sentence-level hallucination detection, covering primary hallucination types (i.e., object, attribute, and relationship). Then, we propose a detect-then-rewrite pipeline to automatically construct preference dataset for training hallucination mitigating model. Furthermore, we propose differentiating the severity of hallucinations, and introducing a Hallucination Severity-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HSA-DPO) for mitigating hallucination in LVLMs by incorporating the severity of hallucinations into preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

We focus on the centralized case, where at each time step, an online platform matches the agents, and obtains a noisy evaluation reflecting their preferences. Our aim is to quickly identify the stable matching that is left-side optimal, rendering this a pure exploration problem with bandit feedback. We specifically aim to find Probably Correct Optimal Stable Matchings and present several bandit algorithms to do so. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how to efficiently gather and utilize preference information to identify the optimal stable matching in two-sided markets under uncertainty. An experimental analysis on synthetic data complements theoretical results on sample complexities for the proposed methods.

> Meta-learning is a practical learning paradigm to transfer skills across tasks from a few examples. Nevertheless, the existence of task distribution shifts tends to weaken meta-learners' generalization capability, particularly when the training task distribution is naively hand-crafted or based on simple priors that fail to cover critical scenarios sufficiently. Here, we consider explicitly generative modeling task distributions placed over task identifiers and propose robustifying fast adaptation from adversarial training. Our approach, which can be interpreted as a model of a Stackelberg game, not only uncovers the task structure during problem-solving from an explicit generative model but also theoretically increases the adaptation robustness in worst cases. This work has practical implications, particularly in dealing with task distribution shifts in meta-learning, and contributes to theoretical insights in the field. Our method demonstrates its robustness in the presence of task subpopulation shifts and improved performance over SOTA baselines in extensive experiments.

> Reducing MRI scan times can improve patient care and lower healthcare costs. Many acceleration methods are designed to reconstruct diagnostic-quality images from limited sets of acquired $\textit{k}$-space data. This task can be framed as a linear inverse problem (LIP), where, as a result of undersampling, the forward operator may become rank-deficient or exhibit small singular values. This results in ambiguities in reconstruction, in which multiple generally incorrect or non-diagnostic images can map to the same acquired data. To address such ambiguities, it is crucial to incorporate prior knowledge, for example in the form of regularization. Another form of prior knowledge less commonly used in medical imaging is contextual side information garnered from other sources than the current acquisition. Here, we propose the $\textbf{T}$rust-$\textbf{G}$uided $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{N}$etwork $\textbf{(TGVN)}$, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that effectively integrates side information into LIPs. TGVN eliminates undesirable solutions from the ambiguous space of the forward operator while remaining faithful to the acquired data. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multi-coil, multi-contrast MR image reconstruction, where incomplete or low-quality measurements from one contrast are used as side information to reconstruct high-quality images of another contrast from heavily under-sampled data. Our method is robust across different contrasts, anatomies, and field strengths. Compared to baselines that also utilize side information, TGVN achieves superior image quality at challenging under-sampling levels, drastically speeding up acquisition while minimizing hallucinations. Our approach is also versatile enough to incorporate many different types of side information (including previous scans or even text) into any LIP.

> Transformers have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, but their monolithic architecture presents challenges in interpretability, adaptability, and scalability. This paper introduces a novel modular Transformer architecture that explicitly decouples knowledge and reasoning through a generalized cross-attention mechanism to a globally shared knowledge base with layer-specific transformations, specifically designed for effective knowledge retrieval. Critically, we provide a rigorous mathematical derivation demonstrating that the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in a standard Transformer is a specialized case (a closure) of this generalized cross-attention, revealing its role in implicit knowledge retrieval and validating our design. This theoretical framework provides a new lens for understanding FFNs and lays the foundation for future research exploring enhanced interpretability, adaptability, and scalability, enabling richer interplay with external knowledge bases and other systems.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, yet they still face significant challenges in reasoning and arithmetic. Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area.

> We propose Group Shapley, a metric that extends the classical individual-level Shapley value framework to evaluate the importance of feature groups, addressing the structured nature of predictors commonly found in business and economic data. More importantly, we develop a significance testing procedure based on a three-cumulant chi-square approximation and establish the asymptotic properties of the test statistics for Group Shapley values. Our approach can effectively handle challenging scenarios, including sparse or skewed distributions and small sample sizes, outperforming alternative tests such as the Wald test. Simulations confirm that the proposed test maintains robust empirical size and demonstrates enhanced power under diverse conditions. To illustrate the method's practical relevance in advancing Explainable AI, we apply our framework to bond recovery rate predictions using a global dataset (1996-2023) comprising 2,094 observations and 98 features, grouped into 16 subgroups and five broader categories: bond characteristics, firm fundamentals, industry-specific factors, market-related variables, and macroeconomic indicators. Our results identify the market-related variables group as the most influential. Furthermore, Lorenz curves and Gini indices reveal that Group Shapley assigns feature importance more equitably compared to individual Shapley values.

> Imaging is a standard example of an inverse problem, where the task of reconstructing a ground truth from a noisy measurement is ill-posed. Recent state-of-the-art approaches for imaging use deep learning, spearheaded by unrolled and end-to-end models and trained on various image datasets. However, many such methods require the availability of ground truth data, which may be unavailable or expensive, leading to a fundamental barrier that can not be bypassed by choice of architecture. Unsupervised learning presents an alternative paradigm that bypasses this requirement, as they can be learned directly on noisy data and do not require any ground truths. A principled Bayesian approach to unsupervised learning is to maximize the marginal likelihood with respect to the given noisy measurements, which is intrinsically linked to classical variational regularization. We propose an unsupervised approach using maximum marginal likelihood estimation to train a convex neural network-based image regularization term directly on noisy measurements, improving upon previous work in both model expressiveness and dataset size. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces priors that are near competitive when compared to the analogous supervised training method for various image corruption operators, maintaining significantly better generalization properties when compared to end-to-end methods. Moreover, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of our proposed algorithm.

> Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+8.9\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.

> Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have been fueled by large-scale data and deep neural networks, particularly for high-dimensional and complex tasks. Online RL methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are effective in dynamic scenarios but require substantial real-time data, posing challenges in resource-constrained or slow simulation environments. Offline RL addresses this by pre-learning policies from large datasets, though its success depends on the quality and diversity of the data. This work proposes a framework that enhances PPO algorithms by incorporating a diffusion model to generate high-quality virtual trajectories for offline datasets. This approach improves exploration and sample efficiency, leading to significant gains in cumulative rewards, convergence speed, and strategy stability in complex tasks. Our contributions are threefold: we explore the potential of diffusion models in RL, particularly for offline datasets, extend the application of online RL to offline environments, and experimentally validate the performance improvements of PPO with diffusion models. These findings provide new insights and methods for applying RL to high-dimensional, complex tasks. Finally, we open-source our code at https://github.com/TianciGao/DiffPPO

> Data-centric methods have shown great potential in understanding and predicting spatiotemporal dynamics, enabling better design and control of the object system. However, deep learning models often lack interpretability, fail to obey intrinsic physics, and struggle to cope with the various domains. While geometry-based methods, e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs), have been proposed to further tackle these challenges, they still need to find the implicit physical laws from large datasets and rely excessively on rich labeled data. In this paper, we herein introduce the conservation-informed GNN (CiGNN), an end-to-end explainable learning framework, to learn spatiotemporal dynamics based on limited training data. The network is designed to conform to the general conservation law via symmetry, where conservative and non-conservative information passes over a multiscale space enhanced by a latent temporal marching strategy. The efficacy of our model has been verified in various spatiotemporal systems based on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superiority over baseline models. Results demonstrate that CiGNN exhibits remarkable accuracy and generalizability, and is readily applicable to learning for prediction of various spatiotemporal dynamics in a spatial domain with complex geometry.

> Perturbation-based mechanisms, such as differential privacy, mitigate gradient leakage attacks by introducing noise into the gradients, thereby preventing attackers from reconstructing clients' private data from the leaked gradients. However, can gradient perturbation protection mechanisms truly defend against all gradient leakage attacks? In this paper, we present the first attempt to break the shield of gradient perturbation protection in Federated Learning for the extraction of private information. We focus on common noise distributions, specifically Gaussian and Laplace, and apply our approach to DNN and CNN models. We introduce Mjolnir, a perturbation-resilient gradient leakage attack that is capable of removing perturbations from gradients without requiring additional access to the original model structure or external data. Specifically, we leverage the inherent diffusion properties of gradient perturbation protection to develop a novel diffusion-based gradient denoising model for Mjolnir. By constructing a surrogate client model that captures the structure of perturbed gradients, we obtain crucial gradient data for training the diffusion model. We further utilize the insight that monitoring disturbance levels during the reverse diffusion process can enhance gradient denoising capabilities, allowing Mjolnir to generate gradients that closely approximate the original, unperturbed versions through adaptive sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mjolnir effectively recovers the protected gradients and exposes the Federated Learning process to the threat of gradient leakage, achieving superior performance in gradient denoising and private data recovery.

> In congestion games, selfish users behave myopically to crowd to the shortest paths, and the social planner designs mechanisms to regulate such selfish routing through information or payment incentives. However, such mechanism design requires the knowledge of time-varying traffic conditions and it is the users themselves to learn and report past road experiences to the social planner (e.g., Waze or Google Maps). When congestion games meet mobile crowdsourcing, it is critical to incentivize selfish users to explore non-shortest paths in the best exploitation-exploration trade-off. First, we consider a simple but fundamental parallel routing network with one deterministic path and multiple stochastic paths for users with an average arrival probability $\lambda$. We prove that the current myopic routing policy (widely used in Waze and Google Maps) misses both exploration (when strong hazard belief) and exploitation (when weak hazard belief) as compared to the social optimum. Due to the myopic policy's under-exploration, we prove that the caused price of anarchy (PoA) is larger than \(\frac{1}{1-\rho^{\frac{1}{\lambda}}}\), which can be arbitrarily large as discount factor \(\rho\rightarrow1\). To mitigate such huge efficiency loss, we propose a novel selective information disclosure (SID) mechanism: we only reveal the latest traffic information to users when they intend to over-explore stochastic paths upon arrival, while hiding such information when they want to under-explore. We prove that our mechanism successfully reduces PoA to be less than~\(2\). Besides the parallel routing network, we further extend our mechanism and PoA results to any linear path graphs with multiple intermediate nodes.

> Machine learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers manipulate model behavior through data tampering or architectural modifications. Traditional backdoor attacks involve injecting malicious samples with specific triggers into the training data, causing the model to produce targeted incorrect outputs in the presence of the corresponding triggers. More sophisticated attacks modify the model's architecture directly, embedding backdoors that are harder to detect as they evade traditional data-based detection methods. However, the drawback of the architectural modification based backdoor attacks is that the trigger must be visible in order to activate the backdoor. To further strengthen the invisibility of the backdoor attacks, a novel backdoor attack method is presented in the paper. To be more specific, this method embeds the backdoor within the model's architecture and has the capability to generate inconspicuous and stealthy triggers. The attack is implemented by modifying pre-trained models, which are then redistributed, thereby posing a potential threat to unsuspecting users. Comprehensive experiments conducted on standard computer vision benchmarks validate the effectiveness of this attack and highlight the stealthiness of its triggers, which remain undetectable through both manual visual inspection and advanced detection tools.

> Structured state-space models (SSMs) such as S4, stemming from the seminal work of Gu et al., are gaining popularity as effective approaches for modeling sequential data. Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.

- `2410.23569v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23569v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23569v3)

> Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has recently surged in popularity, particularly for aligning large language models and other AI systems with human intentions. At its core, RLHF can be viewed as a specialized instance of Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL), where the preferences specifically originate from human judgments rather than arbitrary evaluators. Despite this connection, most existing approaches in both RLHF and PbRL primarily focus on optimizing a mean reward objective, neglecting scenarios that necessitate risk-awareness, such as AI safety, healthcare, and autonomous driving. These scenarios often operate under a one-episode-reward setting, which makes conventional risk-sensitive objectives inapplicable. To address this, we explore and prove the applicability of two risk-aware objectives to PbRL : nested and static quantile risk objectives. We also introduce Risk-AwarePbRL (RA-PbRL), an algorithm designed to optimize both nested and static objectives. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the regret upper bounds, demonstrating that they are sublinear with respect to the number of episodes, and present empirical results to support our findings. Our code is available in https://github.com/aguilarjose11/PbRLNeurips.

> Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.

> This paper explores foundational and applied aspects of survival analysis, using fall risk assessment as a case study. It revisits key time-related probability distributions and statistical methods, including logistic regression, Poisson regression, Exponential regression, and the Cox Proportional Hazards model, offering a unified perspective on their relationships within the survival analysis framework. A contribution of this work is the step-by-step derivation and clarification of the relationships among these models, particularly demonstrating that Poisson regression in the survival context is a specific case of the Cox model. These insights address gaps in understanding and reinforce the simplicity and interpretability of survival models. The paper also emphasizes the practical utility of survival analysis by connecting theoretical insights with real-world applications. In the context of fall detection, it demonstrates how these models can simultaneously predict fall risk, analyze contributing factors, and estimate time-to-event outcomes within a single streamlined framework. In contrast, advanced deep learning methods often require complex post-hoc interpretation and separate training for different tasks particularly when working with structured numerical data. This highlights the enduring relevance of classical statistical frameworks and makes survival models especially valuable in healthcare settings, where explainability and robustness are critical. By unifying foundational concepts and offering a cohesive perspective on time-to-event analysis, this work serves as an accessible resource for understanding survival models and applying them effectively to diverse analytical challenges.

> We consider the task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, which involves transforming static images into realistic video sequences based on a textual description. While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

> We introduce the Stress-Guided Lightweight Design Benchmark (SGLDBench), a comprehensive benchmark suite to apply and evaluate material layout strategies for generating stiff lightweight designs in 3D domains. SGLDBench provides a seamlessly integrated simulation and analysis framework, providing six reference strategies accompanied by a scalable multigrid elasticity solver to efficiently execute these strategies and validate the stiffness of their results. This facilitates systematic analysis and comparison of design strategies regarding the mechanical properties they achieve. SGLDBench enables the evaluation of diverse settings of load conditions and, through the tight integration of the solver, enables support for high-resolution designs and stiffness analysis. Moreover, SGLDBench emphasizes visual analysis to explore relations between the geometric structure of a design and the distribution of stresses, providing insights into the specific properties and behaviors of different design strategies. SGLDBenchs' specific features are highlighted in several experiments, by comparing the results of reference strategies with respect to geometric and mechanical properties.

> In recent years, data-driven deep learning models have gained significant interest in the analysis of turbulent dynamical systems. Within the context of reduced-order models (ROMs), convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) pose a universally applicable alternative to conventional approaches. They can learn nonlinear transformations directly from data, without prior knowledge of the system. However, the features generated by such models lack interpretability. Thus, the resulting model is a black-box which effectively reduces the complexity of the system, but does not provide insights into the meaning of the latent features. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel interpretable CAE approach for high-dimensional fluid flow data that maintains the reconstruction quality of conventional CAEs and allows for feature interpretation. Our method can be easily integrated into any existing CAE architecture with minor modifications of the training process. We compare our approach to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two existing methods for interpretable CAEs. We apply all methods to three different experimental turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection datasets with varying complexity. Our results show that the proposed method is lightweight, easy to train, and achieves relative reconstruction performance improvements of up to 6.4% over POD for 64 modes. The relative improvement increases to up to 229.8% as the number of modes decreases. Additionally, our method delivers interpretable features similar to those of POD and is significantly less resource-intensive than existing CAE approaches, using less than 2% of the parameters. These approaches either trade interpretability for reconstruction performance or only provide interpretability to a limited extend.

> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been gaining a lot of interest due to their adaptability and extensibility in emerging applications, including communication networks. It is anticipated that ZSM networks will be able to support LLMs as a service, as they provide ultra reliable low-latency communications and closed loop massive connectivity. However, LLMs are vulnerable to data and model privacy issues that affect the trustworthiness of LLMs to be deployed for user-based services. In this paper, we explore the security vulnerabilities associated with fine-tuning LLMs in ZSM networks, in particular the membership inference attack. We define the characteristics of an attack network that can perform a membership inference attack if the attacker has access to the fine-tuned model for the downstream task. We show that the membership inference attacks are effective for any downstream task, which can lead to a personal data breach when using LLM as a service. The experimental results show that the attack success rate of maximum 92% can be achieved on named entity recognition task. Based on the experimental analysis, we discuss possible defense mechanisms and present possible research directions to make the LLMs more trustworthy in the context of ZSM networks.

> Artificial intelligence (AI) for fluid mechanics has become attractive topic. High-fidelity data is one of most critical issues for the successful applications of AI in fluid mechanics, however, it is expensively obtained or even inaccessible. This study proposes a high-efficient data forward generation method from the partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, the solutions of the PDEs are first generated either following a random field (e.g. Gaussian random field, GRF, computational complexity O(NlogN), N is the number of spatial points) or physical laws (e.g. a kind of spectra, computational complexity O(NM), M is the number of modes), then the source terms, boundary conditions and initial conditions are computed to satisfy PDEs. Thus, the data pairs of source terms, boundary conditions and initial conditions with corresponding solutions of PDEs can be constructed. A Poisson neural network (Poisson-NN) embedded in projection method and a wavelet transform convolutional neuro network (WTCNN) embedded in multigrid numerical simulation for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is respectively proposed. The feasibility of generated data for training Poisson-NN and WTCNN is validated. The results indicate that even without any DNS data, the generated data can train these two models with excellent generalization and accuracy. The data following physical laws can significantly improve the convergence rate, generalization and accuracy than that generated following GRF.

> To preserve user privacy in recommender systems, federated recommendation (FR) based on federated learning (FL) emerges, keeping the personal data on the local client and updating a model collaboratively. Unlike FL, FR has a unique sparse aggregation mechanism, where the embedding of each item is updated by only partial clients, instead of full clients in a dense aggregation of general FL. Recently, as an essential principle of FL, model security has received increasing attention, especially for Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients can send arbitrary updates. The problem of exploring the Byzantine robustness of FR is particularly critical since in the domains applying FR, e.g., e-commerce, malicious clients can be injected easily by registering new accounts. However, existing Byzantine works neglect the unique sparse aggregation of FR, making them unsuitable for our problem. Thus, we make the first effort to investigate Byzantine attacks on FR from the perspective of sparse aggregation, which is non-trivial: it is not clear how to define Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregations and design Byzantine attacks under limited knowledge/capability. In this paper, we reformulate the Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregation by defining the aggregation for a single item as the smallest execution unit. Then we propose a family of effective attack strategies, named Spattack, which exploit the vulnerability in sparse aggregation and are categorized along the adversary's knowledge and capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Spattack can effectively prevent convergence and even break down defenses under a few malicious clients, raising alarms for securing FR systems.

> Vector quantization is a fundamental technique for compression and large-scale nearest neighbor search. For high-accuracy operating points, multi-codebook quantization associates data vectors with one element from each of multiple codebooks. An example is residual quantization (RQ), which iteratively quantizes the residual error of previous steps. Dependencies between the different parts of the code are, however, ignored in RQ, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion performance. QINCo recently addressed this inefficiency by using a neural network to determine the quantization codebook in RQ based on the vector reconstruction from previous steps. In this paper we introduce QINCo2 which extends and improves QINCo with (i) improved vector encoding using codeword pre-selection and beam-search, (ii) a fast approximate decoder leveraging codeword pairs to establish accurate short-lists for search, and (iii) an optimized training procedure and network architecture. We conduct experiments on four datasets to evaluate QINCo2 for vector compression and billion-scale nearest neighbor search. We obtain outstanding results in both settings, improving the state-of-the-art reconstruction MSE by 34% for 16-byte vector compression on BigANN, and search accuracy by 24% with 8-byte encodings on Deep1M.

> Latent diffusion models with Transformer architectures excel at generating high-fidelity images. However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in this two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in visual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially larger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable generation performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for sub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information loss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive computation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent difficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address this, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation models when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision foundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the reconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster convergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces. To exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with improved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT. The integrated system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet 256x256 generation with an FID score of 1.35 while demonstrating remarkable training efficiency by reaching an FID score of 2.11 in just 64 epochs--representing an over 21 times convergence speedup compared to the original DiT.

> Personalized fashion recommendation is a difficult task because 1) the decisions are highly correlated with users' aesthetic appetite, which previous work frequently overlooks, and 2) many new items are constantly rolling out that cause strict cold-start problems in the popular identity (ID)-based recommendation methods. These new items are critical to recommend because of trend-driven consumerism. In this work, we aim to provide more accurate personalized fashion recommendations and solve the cold-start problem by converting available information, especially images, into two attribute graphs focusing on optimized image utilization and noise-reducing user modeling. Compared with previous methods that separate image and text as two components, the proposed method combines image and text information to create a richer attributes graph. Capitalizing on the advancement of large language and vision models, we experiment with extracting fine-grained attributes efficiently and as desired using two different prompts. Preliminary experiments on the IQON3000 dataset have shown that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy compared with baselines.

> Imbalanced classification and spurious correlation are common challenges in data science and machine learning. Both issues are linked to data imbalance, with certain groups of data samples significantly underrepresented, which in turn would compromise the accuracy, robustness and generalizability of the learned models. Recent advances have proposed leveraging the flexibility and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically built on transformer architectures, to generate synthetic samples and to augment the observed data. In the context of imbalanced data, LLMs are used to oversample underrepresented groups and have shown promising improvements. However, there is a clear lack of theoretical understanding of such synthetic data approaches. In this article, we develop novel theoretical foundations to systematically study the roles of synthetic samples in addressing imbalanced classification and spurious correlation. Specifically, we first explicitly quantify the benefits of synthetic oversampling. Next, we analyze the scaling dynamics in synthetic data augmentation, and derive the corresponding scaling law. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of transformer models to generate high-quality synthetic samples. We further conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate the efficacy of the LLM-based synthetic oversampling and augmentation.

> The increasing sophistication of text-to-image generative models has led to complex challenges in defining and enforcing copyright infringement criteria and protection. Existing methods, such as watermarking and dataset deduplication, fail to provide comprehensive solutions due to the lack of standardized metrics and the inherent complexity of addressing copyright infringement in diffusion models. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Copyright Protection(RLCP) method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Model, which minimizes the generation of copyright-infringing content while maintaining the quality of the model-generated dataset. Our approach begins with the introduction of a novel copyright metric grounded in copyright law and court precedents on infringement. We then utilize the Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) framework to guide the model through a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing it using a reward function that incorporates our proposed copyright metric. Additionally, we employ KL divergence as a regularization term to mitigate some failure modes and stabilize RL fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on 3 mixed datasets of copyright and non-copyright images demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces copyright infringement risk while maintaining image quality.

> One of the current trends in robotics is to employ large language models (LLMs) to provide non-predefined command execution and natural human-robot interaction. It is useful to have an environment map together with its language representation, which can be further utilized by LLMs. Such a comprehensive scene representation enables numerous ways of interaction with the map for autonomously operating robots. In this work, we present an approach that enhances incremental implicit mapping through the integration of vision-language features. Specifically, we (i) propose a decoder optimization technique for implicit language maps which can be used when new objects appear on the scene, and (ii) address the problem of inconsistent vision-language predictions between different viewing positions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LiLMaps and solid improvements in performance.

> In the realm of medical imaging, leveraging large-scale datasets from various institutions is crucial for developing precise deep learning models, yet privacy concerns frequently impede data sharing. federated learning (FL) emerges as a prominent solution for preserving privacy while facilitating collaborative learning. However, its application in real-world scenarios faces several obstacles, such as task & data heterogeneity, label scarcity, non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, computational vaiation, etc. In real-world, medical institutions may not want to disclose their tasks to FL server and generalization challenge of out-of-network institutions with un-seen task want to join the on-going federated system. This study address task-agnostic and generalization problem on un-seen tasks by adapting self-supervised FL framework. Utilizing Vision Transformer (ViT) as consensus feature encoder for self-supervised pre-training, no initial labels required, the framework enabling effective representation learning across diverse datasets and tasks. Our extensive evaluations, using various real-world non-IID medical imaging datasets, validate our approach's efficacy, retaining 90\% of F1 accuracy with only 5\% of the training data typically required for centralized approaches and exhibiting superior adaptability to out-of-distribution task. The result indicate that federated learning architecture can be a potential approach toward multi-task foundation modeling.

> Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data in Federated Learning (FL) causes client drift issues, leading to slower convergence and reduced model performance. While existing approaches mitigate this issue in Centralized FL (CFL) using a central server, Decentralized FL (DFL) remains underexplored. In DFL, the absence of a central entity results in nodes accessing a global view of the federation, further intensifying the challenges of non-IID data. Drawing on the entropy pooling algorithm employed in financial contexts to synthesize diverse investment opinions, this work proposes the Federated Entropy Pooling (FedEP) algorithm to mitigate the non-IID challenge in DFL. FedEP leverages Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to fit local data distributions, sharing statistical parameters among neighboring nodes to estimate the global distribution. Aggregation weights are determined using the entropy pooling approach between local and global distributions. By sharing only synthetic distribution information, FedEP preserves data privacy while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that FedEP achieves faster convergence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various non-IID settings.

> We propose an expressive and efficient approach that combines the strengths of two prominent extensions of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Subgraph GNNs and Structural Encodings (SEs). Our approach leverages walk-based centrality measures, both as a powerful form of SE and also as a subgraph selection strategy for Subgraph GNNs. By drawing a connection to perturbation analysis, we highlight the effectiveness of centrality-based sampling, and show it significantly reduces the computational burden associated with Subgraph GNNs. Further, we combine our efficient Subgraph GNN with SEs derived from the calculated centrality and demonstrate this hybrid approach, dubbed HyMN, gains in discriminative power. HyMN effectively addresses the expressiveness limitations of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) while mitigating the computational costs of Subgraph GNNs. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks, we show it outperforms other subgraph sampling approaches while being competitive with full-bag Subgraph GNNs and other state-of-the-art approaches with a notably reduced runtime.

> Federated Learning (FL) is widely recognized as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm due to its model-sharing mechanism that avoids direct data exchange. However, model training inevitably leaves exploitable traces that can be used to infer sensitive information. In Decentralized FL (DFL), the overlay topology significantly influences its models' convergence, robustness, and security. This study explores the feasibility of inferring the overlay topology of DFL systems based solely on model behavior, introducing a novel Topology Inference Attack. A taxonomy of topology inference attacks is proposed, categorizing them by the attacker's capabilities and knowledge. Practical attack strategies are developed for different scenarios, and quantitative experiments are conducted to identify key factors influencing the attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that analyzing only the public models of individual nodes can accurately infer the DFL topology, underscoring the risk of sensitive information leakage in DFL systems. This finding offers valuable insights for improving privacy preservation in decentralized learning environments.

> Software testing is a crucial but time-consuming aspect of software development, and recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity for automated test case generation. However, because LLMs are trained on vast amounts of open-source code, they often generate test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM), wherein we utilize Reinforcement Learning to generate high-quality unit tests based on static analysis-based quality metrics. First, we analyzed LLM-generated tests and show that LLMs frequently do generate undesirable test smells -- up to 37% of the time. Then, we implemented lightweight static analysis-based reward model and trained LLMs using this reward model to optimize for five code quality metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized Codex model consistently generated higher-quality test cases than the base LLM, improving quality metrics by up to 23%, and generated nearly 100% syntactically-correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on all code quality metrics, in spite of training a substantially cheaper Codex model. We provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and show that RLSQM is a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of automated software testing.

> Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM (p-value $<0.01$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.

> We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate physical systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.

> The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing metric measure spaces which has found broad applications in data science and machine learning. Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. This paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.

> Software testing is a crucial aspect of software development, and the creation of high-quality tests that adhere to best practices is essential for effective maintenance. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity for code generation, including the automated creation of test cases. However, these LLMs are often trained on vast amounts of publicly available code, which may include test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose a novel technique called Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM). To begin, we analyze the anti-patterns generated by the LLM and show that LLMs can generate undesirable test smells. Thus, we train specific reward models for each static quality metric, then utilize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train models for optimizing a single quality metric at a time. Furthermore, we amalgamate these rewards into a unified reward model aimed at capturing different best practices and quality aspects of tests. By comparing RL-trained models with those trained using supervised learning, we provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and into the effects of various training strategies. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized model consistently generated high-quality test cases compared to the base LLM, improving the model by up to 21%, and successfully generates nearly 100% syntactically correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on four out of seven metrics. This represents a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of software testing through Reinforcement Learning and static quality metrics.

> We introduce DAG-TFRC, a novel method for learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from time series with few root causes. By this, we mean that the data are generated by a small number of events at certain, unknown nodes and time points under a structural vector autoregression model. For such data, we (i) learn the DAGs representing both the instantaneous and time-lagged dependencies between nodes, and (ii) discover the location and time of the root causes. For synthetic data with few root causes, DAG-TFRC shows superior performance in accuracy and runtime over prior work, scaling up to thousands of nodes. Experiments on simulated and real-world financial data demonstrate the viability of our sparse root cause assumption. On S&P 500 data, DAG-TFRC successfully clusters stocks by sectors and discovers major stock movements as root causes.

> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant discrepancy persists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We identify this gap as primarily stemming from current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are crucial. This work makes two key contributions. First, we introduce G-Pass@k, a novel evaluation metric that provides a continuous assessment of model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's peak performance potential and its stability. Second, we present LiveMathBench, a dynamic benchmark comprising challenging, contemporary mathematical problems designed to minimize data leakage risks during evaluation. Through extensive experiments using G-Pass@k on state-of-the-art LLMs with LiveMathBench, we provide comprehensive insights into both their maximum capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal substantial room for improvement in LLMs' "realistic" reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods. The benchmark and detailed results are available at: https://github.com/open-compass/GPassK.

> In this work, we study the experts problem in the distributed setting where an expert's cost needs to be aggregated across multiple servers. Our study considers various communication models such as the message-passing model and the broadcast model, along with multiple aggregation functions, such as summing and taking the $\ell_p$ norm of an expert's cost across servers. We propose the first communication-efficient protocols that achieve near-optimal regret in these settings, even against a strong adversary who can choose the inputs adaptively. Additionally, we give a conditional lower bound showing that the communication of our protocols is nearly optimal. Finally, we implement our protocols and demonstrate empirical savings on the HPO-B benchmarks.

> Scenario-based training has been widely adopted in many public service sectors. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in simulating diverse personas to create these training scenarios. However, little is known about how LLMs can be developed to simulate victims for scenario-based training purposes. In this paper, we introduce VicSim (victim simulator), a novel model that addresses three key dimensions of user simulation: informational faithfulness, emotional dynamics, and language style (e.g., grammar usage). We pioneer the integration of scenario-based victim modeling with GAN-based training workflow and key-information-based prompting, aiming to enhance the realism of simulated victims. Our adversarial training approach teaches the discriminator to recognize grammar and emotional cues as reliable indicators of synthetic content. According to evaluations by human raters, the VicSim model outperforms GPT-4 in terms of human-likeness.

> Today, many auctions are carried out with the help of intermediary platforms like Google and eBay. We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted auctions.Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on designing auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully,assuming that the platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however, the platforms have been found to manipulate the auctions to earn more profit, resulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits. We propose a new model for studying platform-assisted auctions in the permissionless setting. We explore whether it is possible to design a dream auction in thisnew model, such that honest behavior is the utility-maximizing strategy for each individual buyer, the platform, the seller, as well as platform-seller or platform-buyer coalitions.Through a collection of feasibility and infeasibility results,we carefully characterize the mathematical landscape of platform-assisted auctions. We show how cryptography can lend to the design of an efficient platform-assisted auction with dream properties. Although a line of works have also used MPC or the blockchain to remove the reliance on a trusted auctioneer, our work is distinct in nature in several dimensions.First, we initiate a systematic exploration of the game theoretic implications when the service providers are strategic and can collude with sellers or buyers. Second, we observe that the full simulation paradigm is too stringent and leads to high asymptotical costs. Specifically, because every player has a different private outcomein an auction protocol, running any generic MPC protocol among the players would incur at least $n^2$ total cost. We propose a new notion of simulation calledutility-dominated emulation.Under this new notion, we showhow to design efficient auction protocols with quasilinear efficiency.

This combination lets us interpret the RL policy's inner workings for safe decision-making. We demonstrate its applicability in various experiments.

> This research focuses on developing a method for restoring the topology of digital images of paper documents captured by a camera, using algorithms for detection, segmentation, geometry restoration, and dewarping. Our methodology employs deep learning (DL) for document outline detection, followed by computer vision (CV) to create a topological 2D grid using cubic polynomial interpolation and correct nonlinear distortions by remapping the image. Using classical CV methods makes the document topology restoration process more efficient and faster, as it requires significantly fewer computational resources and memory. We developed a new pipeline for automatic document dewarping and reconstruction, along with a framework and annotated dataset to demonstrate its efficiency. Our experiments confirm the promise of our methodology and its superiority over existing benchmarks (including mobile apps and popular DL solutions, such as RectiNet, DocGeoNet, and DocTr++) both visually and in terms of document readability via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and geometry restoration metrics. This paves the way for creating high-quality digital copies of paper documents and enhancing the efficiency of OCR systems. Project page: https://github.com/HorizonParadox/DRCCBI

> Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on large-scale pretrained foundation models (PFMs) such as vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), diffusion models and vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated the ability to solve complex and truly non-trivial AI problems in a wide variety of domains and contexts. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, learn from vast and diverse data sources, allowing rich and nuanced representations of the world and, thereby, providing extensive capabilities, including the ability to reason, engage in meaningful dialog; collaborate with humans and other agents to jointly solve complex problems; and understand social and emotional aspects of humans. Despite this impressive feat, the cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs trained on large-scale datasets are still superficial and brittle. Consequently, generic LLMs are severely limited in their generalist capabilities. A number of foundational problems -- embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory -- are required to be addressed for LLMs to attain human-level general intelligence. These concepts are more aligned with human cognition and provide LLMs with inherent human-like cognitive properties that support the realization of physically-plausible, semantically meaningful, flexible and more generalizable knowledge and intelligence. In this work, we discuss the aforementioned foundational issues and survey state-of-the art approaches for implementing these concepts in LLMs. Specifically, we discuss how the principles of embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory can be leveraged toward the attainment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in an organic manner.

> LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a widely used model fine-tuning method. In fine-tuning, the law among model performance, model parameters, and data complexity has been a focal issue in the field. Existing methods often leverage external metrics (such as cross-entropy or perplexity) to evaluate model performance. In the fine-tuning process for large models, two types of knowledge are typically involved: the frozen, general knowledge acquired by the model during pre-training and the new knowledge learned through the LoRA module from the current data. Generally, the less LoRA's learned knowledge relies on the large model, the more it captures the specific knowledge of new data, thereby enhancing its adaptability to new tasks. However, external metrics do not readily capture the dependency relationship between these two types of knowledge. Therefore, we designed an internal metric based on the Mutual Information Upper Bound (MIUB) theory to investigate the scaling law of large-model LoRA fine-tuning. In our experiments, we validated this approach on benchmark datasets, using the Llama3-8B and Phi3-3B models. The results show that the proposed MIUB metric aligns more accurately and stably with the scaling law of LoRA fine-tuning compared to cross-entropy and perplexity.

> This study investigates the use of the $J$-integral to compute the statistics of the energy release rate of a random elastic medium. The spatial variability of the elastic modulus is modeled as a homogeneous lognormal random field. Within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation, a modified contour integral is applied to evaluate the first and second statistical moments of the energy release rate. These results are compared with the energy release rate calculated from the potential energy function. The comparison shows that, if the random field of elastic modulus is homogeneous in space, the path independence of the classical $J$-integral remains valid for calculating the mean energy release rate. However, this path independence does not extend to the higher order statistical moments. The simulation further reveals the effect of the correlation length of the spatially varying elastic modulus on the energy release rate of the specimen.

> Anisotropic X-ray Dark-Field Tomography (AXDT) is a novel imaging technology that enables the extraction of fiber structures on the micrometer scale, far smaller than standard X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) setups. Directional and structural information is relevant in medical diagnostics and material testing. Compared to existing solutions, AXDT could prove a viable alternative. Reconstruction methods in AXDT have so far been driven by practicality. Improved methods could make AXDT more accessible. We contribute numerically stable implementations and validation of advanced statistical reconstruction methods that incorporate the statistical noise behavior of the imaging system. We further provide a new statistical reconstruction formulation that retains the advanced noise assumptions of the imaging setup while being efficient and easy to optimize. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the optimization behavior for all models regarding AXDT. Our experiments show that statistical reconstruction outperforms the previously used model, and particularly the noise performance is superior. While the previously proposed statistical method is effective, it is computationally expensive, and our newly proposed formulation proves highly efficient with identical performance. Our theoretical analysis opens the possibility to new and more advanced reconstruction algorithms, which in turn enable future research in AXDT.

> Decentralized learning strategies allow a collection of agents to learn efficiently from local data sets without the need for central aggregation or orchestration. Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9% to 79.8%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including semantic parsing, which trans lates natural language into formal code representations. However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention. This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes. In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks. We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task. We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.

> [Notice: This version is outdated. Recent research contradicts some key claims; we are working on a major revision with more nuanced analysis. Please wait for the updated version.]   While LLMs excel at multi-hop questions (e.g. "Who is the spouse of the performer of Imagine?") when using chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT), they struggle when forced to reason internally (without CoT). Previous work on the size and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct and GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering two-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent reasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However, to our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when learned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level accuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose separately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier LLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT reasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial success with CoT across most categories. These results suggest that LLMs lack a general capability for latent multi-hop reasoning independent of the question type.

> A very crucial part of Bangladeshi people's employment, GDP contribution, and mainly livelihood is agriculture. It plays a vital role in decreasing poverty and ensuring food security. Plant diseases are a serious stumbling block in agricultural production in Bangladesh. At times, humans can't detect the disease from an infected leaf with the naked eye. Using inorganic chemicals or pesticides in plants when it's too late leads in vain most of the time, deposing all the previous labor. The deep-learning technique of leaf-based image classification, which has shown impressive results, can make the work of recognizing and classifying all diseases trouble-less and more precise. In this paper, we've mainly proposed a better model for the detection of leaf diseases. Our proposed paper includes the collection of data on three different kinds of crops: bell peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes. For training and testing the proposed CNN model, the plant leaf disease dataset collected from Kaggle is used, which has 17,430 images. The images are labeled with 14 separate classes of damage. The developed CNN model performs efficiently and could successfully detect and classify the tested diseases. The proposed CNN model may have great potency in crop disease management.

> We propose a scalable Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm that eliminates the need for backpropagation by training each layer separately. Unlike backpropagation, FF avoids backward gradients and can be more modular and memory efficient, making it appealing for large networks. We extend FF to modern convolutional architectures, such as MobileNetV3 and ResNet18, by introducing a new way to compute losses for convolutional layers. Experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to standard backpropagation. Furthermore, when we divide the network into blocks, such as the residual blocks in ResNet, and apply backpropagation only within each block, but not across blocks, our hybrid design tends to outperform backpropagation baselines while maintaining a similar training speed. Finally, we present experiments on small datasets and transfer learning that confirm the adaptability of our method.

> This paper presents LOLA, a massively multilingual large language model trained on more than 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture. Our architectural and implementation choices address the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and avoiding the common pitfalls of multilinguality. Our analysis of the evaluation results shows competitive performance in natural language generation and understanding tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how the learned expert-routing mechanism exploits implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns to potentially alleviate the curse of multilinguality. We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.

> Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) is the task of detecting the presence of speech from a known target-speaker in an audio frame. Recently, deep neural network-based models have shown good performance in this task. However, training these models requires extensive labelled data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain, particularly if generalization to unseen environments is crucial. To mitigate this, we propose a causal, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) pretraining framework, called Denoising Autoregressive Predictive Coding (DN-APC), to enhance TS-VAD performance in noisy conditions. We also explore various speaker conditioning methods and evaluate their performance under different noisy conditions. Our experiments show that DN-APC improves performance in noisy conditions, with a general improvement of approx. 2% in both seen and unseen noise. Additionally, we find that FiLM conditioning provides the best overall performance. Representation analysis via tSNE plots reveals robust initial representations of speech and non-speech from pretraining. This underscores the effectiveness of SSL pretraining in improving the robustness and performance of TS-VAD models in noisy environments.

> To facilitate effective decision-making, precipitation datasets should include uncertainty estimates. Quantile regression with machine learning has been proposed for issuing such estimates. Distributional regression offers distinct advantages over quantile regression, including the ability to model intermittency as well as a stronger ability to extrapolate beyond the training data, which is critical for predicting extreme precipitation. Therefore, here, we introduce the concept of distributional regression in precipitation dataset creation, specifically for the spatial prediction task of correcting satellite precipitation products. Building upon this concept, we formulated new ensemble learning methods that can be valuable not only for spatial prediction but also for other prediction problems. These methods exploit conditional zero-adjusted probability distributions estimated with generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS), spline-based GAMLSS and distributional regression forests as well as their ensembles (stacking based on quantile regression and equal-weight averaging). To identify the most effective methods for our specific problem, we compared them to benchmarks using a large, multi-source precipitation dataset. Stacking was shown to be superior to individual methods at most quantile levels when evaluated with the quantile loss function. Moreover, while the relative ranking of the methods varied across different quantile levels, stacking methods, and to a lesser extent mean combiners, exhibited lower variance in their performance across different quantiles compared to individual methods that occasionally ranked extremely low. Overall, a task-specific combination of multiple distributional regression algorithms could yield significant benefits in terms of stability.

> In this paper, we propose a novel approach for verifying the compliance of turn-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (TMARL) agents with complex requirements in stochastic multiplayer games. Our method overcomes the limitations of existing verification approaches, which are inadequate for dealing with TMARL agents and not scalable to large games with multiple agents. Our approach relies on tight integration of TMARL and a verification technique referred to as model checking. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our technique through experiments in different types of environments. Our experiments show that our method is suited to verify TMARL agents and scales better than naive monolithic model checking.

> Automated definition generation systems have been proposed to support vocabulary expansion for language learners. The main barrier to the success of these systems is that learners often struggle to understand definitions due to the presence of potentially unfamiliar words and grammar, particularly when non-standard language is involved. To address these challenges, we propose CLIX, the task of Cross-Lingual explanations of Idiomatic eXpressions. We explore the capabilities of current NLP models for this task, and observe that while it remains challenging, large language models show promise. Finally, we perform a detailed error analysis to highlight the key challenges that need to be addressed before we can reliably incorporate these systems into educational tools.

> Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which offer exceptional energy efficiency for inference, and Federated Learning (FL), which offers privacy-preserving distributed training, is a rising area of interest that highly beneficial towards Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Despite this, research that tackles Byzantine attacks and bandwidth limitation in FL-SNNs, both poses significant threats on model convergence and training times, still remains largely unexplored. Going beyond proposing a solution for both of these problems, in this work we highlight the dual benefits of FL-SNNs, against non-omniscient Byzantine adversaries (ones that restrict attackers access to local clients datasets), and greater communication efficiency, over FL-ANNs. Specifically, we discovered that a simple integration of Top-\k{appa} sparsification into the FL apparatus can help leverage the advantages of the SNN models in both greatly reducing bandwidth usage and significantly boosting the robustness of FL training against non-omniscient Byzantine adversaries. Most notably, we saw a massive improvement of roughly 40% accuracy gain in FL-SNNs training under the lethal MinMax attack

> As Large-Scale Cloud Systems (LCS) become increasingly complex, effective anomaly detection is critical for ensuring system reliability and performance. However, there is a shortage of large-scale, real-world datasets available for benchmarking anomaly detection methods.   To address this gap, we introduce a new high-dimensional dataset from IBM Cloud, collected over 4.5 months from the IBM Cloud Console. This dataset comprises 39,365 rows and 117,448 columns of telemetry data. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of machine learning models for anomaly detection and discuss the key challenges faced in this process.   This study and the accompanying dataset provide a resource for researchers and practitioners in cloud system monitoring. It facilitates more efficient testing of anomaly detection methods in real-world data, helping to advance the development of robust solutions to maintain the health and performance of large-scale cloud infrastructures.

> Visual Instruction Tuning typically requires a large amount of vision-language training data. This data often containing redundant information that increases computational costs without proportional performance gains. In this work, we introduce ICONS, a gradient-driven Influence CONsensus approach for vision-language data Selection that selects a compact training dataset for efficient multi-task training. The key element of our approach is cross-task influence consensus, which uses majority voting across task-specific influence matrices to identify samples that are consistently valuable across multiple tasks, allowing us to effectively prioritize data that optimizes for overall performance. Experiments show that models trained on our selected data (20% of LLaVA-665K) achieve 98.6% of the relative performance obtained using the full dataset. Additionally, we release this subset, LLaVA-ICONS-133K, a compact yet highly informative subset of LLaVA-665K visual instruction tuning data, preserving high impact training data for efficient vision-language model development.

> This paper presents a Sim2Real (Simulation to Reality) approach to bridge the gap between a trained agent in a simulated environment and its real-world implementation in navigating a robot in a similar setting. Specifically, we focus on navigating a quadruped robot in a real-world grid-like environment inspired by the Gymnasium Frozen Lake -- a highly user-friendly and free Application Programming Interface (API) to develop and test Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. We detail the development of a pipeline to transfer motion policies learned in the Frozen Lake simulation to a physical quadruped robot, thus enabling autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in a grid without relying on expensive localization and mapping sensors. The work involves training an RL agent in the Frozen Lake environment and utilizing the resulting Q-table to control a 12 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) quadruped robot. In addition to detailing the RL implementation, inverse kinematics-based quadruped gaits, and the transfer policy pipeline, we open-source the project on GitHub and include a demonstration video of our Sim2Real transfer approach. This work provides an accessible, straightforward, and low-cost framework for researchers, students, and hobbyists to explore and implement RL-based robot navigation in real-world grid environments.

> Matroids provide one of the most elegant structures for algorithm design. This is best identified by the Edmonds-Rado theorem relating the success of the simple greedy algorithm to the anatomy of the optimal basis of a matroid [Edm71; Rad57]. As a response, much energy has been devoted to understanding a matroid's computational properties. Yet, less is understood where parallel algorithms are concerned. In response, we initiate the study of parallel matroid optimization in the adaptive complexity model [BS18]. First, we reexamine Bor\r{u}vka's classical minimum weight spanning tree algorithm [Bor26b; Bor26a] in the abstract language of matroid theory, and identify a new certificate of optimality for the basis of any matroid as a result. In particular, a basis is optimal if and only if it contains the points of minimum weight in every circuit of the dual matroid. Hence, we can witnesses whether any specific point belongs to the optimal basis via a test for local optimality in a circuit of the dual matroid, thereby revealing a general design paradigm towards parallel matroid optimization. To instantiate this paradigm, we use the special structure of a binary matroid to identify an optimization scheme with low adaptivity. Here, our key technical step is reducing optimization to the simpler task of basis search in the binary matroid, using only logarithmic overhead of adaptive rounds of queries to independence oracles. Consequentially, we compose our reduction with the parallel basis search method of [KUW88] to obtain an algorithm for finding the optimal basis of a binary matroid terminating in sublinearly many adaptive rounds of queries to an independence oracle. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first algorithm for matroid optimization to outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of adaptive complexity in the independence query model without assuming the matroid is encoded by a graph.

> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a widely adopted approach to mitigate the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in answering domain-specific questions. Previous research has predominantly focused on improving the accuracy and quality of retrieved data chunks to enhance the overall performance of the generation pipeline. However, despite ongoing advancements, the critical issue of retrieving irrelevant information -- which can impair the ability of the model to utilize its internal knowledge effectively -- has received minimal attention. In this work, we investigate the impact of retrieving irrelevant information in open-domain question answering, highlighting its significant detrimental effect on the quality of LLM outputs. To address this challenge, we propose the Context Awareness Gate (CAG) architecture, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts the LLMs' input prompt based on whether the user query necessitates external context retrieval. Additionally, we introduce the Vector Candidates method, a core mathematical component of CAG that is statistical, LLM-independent, and highly scalable. We further examine the distributions of relationships between contexts and questions, presenting a statistical analysis of these distributions. This analysis can be leveraged to enhance the context retrieval process in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

> We introduce FACTS Grounding, an online leaderboard and associated benchmark that evaluates language models' ability to generate text that is factually accurate with respect to given context in the user prompt. In our benchmark, each prompt includes a user request and a full document, with a maximum length of 32k tokens, requiring long-form responses. The long-form responses are required to be fully grounded in the provided context document while fulfilling the user request. Models are evaluated using automated judge models in two phases: (1) responses are disqualified if they do not fulfill the user request; (2) they are judged as accurate if the response is fully grounded in the provided document. The automated judge models were comprehensively evaluated against a held-out test-set to pick the best prompt template, and the final factuality score is an aggregate of multiple judge models to mitigate evaluation bias. The FACTS Grounding leaderboard will be actively maintained over time, and contains both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding the integrity of the leaderboard.

> This study seeks to enhance academic integrity by providing tools to detect AI-generated content in student work using advanced technologies. The findings promote transparency and accountability, helping educators maintain ethical standards and supporting the responsible integration of AI in education. A key contribution of this work is the generation of the CyberHumanAI dataset, which has 1000 observations, 500 of which are written by humans and the other 500 produced by ChatGPT. We evaluate various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms on the CyberHumanAI dataset comparing human-written and AI-generated content from Large Language Models (LLMs) (i.e., ChatGPT). Results demonstrate that traditional ML algorithms, specifically XGBoost and Random Forest, achieve high performance (83% and 81% accuracies respectively). Results also show that classifying shorter content seems to be more challenging than classifying longer content. Further, using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) we identify discriminative features influencing the ML model's predictions, where human-written content tends to use a practical language (e.g., use and allow). Meanwhile AI-generated text is characterized by more abstract and formal terms (e.g., realm and employ). Finally, a comparative analysis with GPTZero show that our narrowly focused, simple, and fine-tuned model can outperform generalized systems like GPTZero. The proposed model achieved approximately 77.5% accuracy compared to GPTZero's 48.5% accuracy when tasked to classify Pure AI, Pure Human, and mixed class. GPTZero showed a tendency to classify challenging and small-content cases as either mixed or unrecognized while our proposed model showed a more balanced performance across the three classes.

> Identifying tropical cyclones that generate destructive storm tides for risk assessment, such as from large downscaled storm catalogs for climate studies, is often intractable because it entails many expensive Monte Carlo hydrodynamic simulations. Here, we show that surrogate models are promising from accuracy, recall, and precision perspectives, and they "generalize" to novel climate scenarios. We then present an informative online learning approach to rapidly search for extreme storm tide-producing cyclones using only a few hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a minimal subset of TCs with detailed storm tide hydrodynamic simulations, a surrogate model selects informative data to retrain online and iteratively improves its predictions of damaging TCs. Results on an extensive catalog of downscaled TCs indicate 100% precision in retrieving rare destructive storms using less than 20% of the simulations as training. The informative sampling approach is efficient, scalable to large storm catalogs, and generalizable to climate scenarios.

> The development of Generative AI Large Language Models (LLMs) raised the alarm regarding identifying content produced through generative AI or humans. In one case, issues arise when students heavily rely on such tools in a manner that can affect the development of their writing or coding skills. Other issues of plagiarism also apply. This study aims to support efforts to detect and identify textual content generated using LLM tools. We hypothesize that LLMs-generated text is detectable by machine learning (ML), and investigate ML models that can recognize and differentiate texts generated by multiple LLMs tools. We leverage several ML and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and utilized Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to understand the important features in attribution. Our method is divided into 1) binary classification to differentiate between human-written and AI-text, and 2) multi classification, to differentiate between human-written text and the text generated by the five different LLM tools (ChatGPT, LLaMA, Google Bard, Claude, and Perplexity). Results show high accuracy in the multi and binary classification. Our model outperformed GPTZero with 98.5\% accuracy to 78.3\%. Notably, GPTZero was unable to recognize about 4.2\% of the observations, but our model was able to recognize the complete test dataset. XAI results showed that understanding feature importance across different classes enables detailed author/source profiles. Further, aiding in attribution and supporting plagiarism detection by highlighting unique stylistic and structural elements ensuring robust content originality verification.

> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing image quality with imaging speed. This trade-off is primarily constrained by k-space measurements, which traverse specific trajectories in the spatial Fourier domain (k-space). These measurements are often undersampled to shorten acquisition times, resulting in image artifacts and compromised quality. Generative models learn image distributions and can be used to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled k-space data. In this work, we present the autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model for image sequences and use it to sample the posterior for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The algorithm incorporates both undersampled k-space and pre-existing information. Models trained with fastMRI dataset are evaluated comprehensively. The results show that the AID model can robustly generate sequentially coherent image sequences. In MRI applications, the AID can outperform the standard diffusion model and reduce hallucinations, due to the learned inter-image dependencies. The project code is available at https://github.com/mrirecon/aid.

The objective is to design an algorithm to minimize a convex population loss using a collaborative effort across $M$ clients, while ensuring the privacy of the local datasets. In this work, we investigate the accuracy-communication-privacy trade-off for this problem. We establish matching converse and achievability results using a novel lower bound and a new algorithm for distributed DP-SCO based on Vaidya's plane cutting method. Thus, our results provide a complete characterization of the accuracy-communication-privacy trade-off for DP-SCO in the distributed setting.

> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiac dyssynchrony are major public health problems in the United States. Precise cardiac image segmentation is crucial for extracting quantitative measures that help categorize cardiac dyssynchrony. However, achieving high accuracy often depends on centralizing large datasets from different hospitals, which can be challenging due to privacy concerns. To solve this problem, Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to enable decentralized model training on such data without exchanging sensitive information. However, bandwidth limitations and data heterogeneity remain as significant challenges in conventional FL algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient and adaptive federate learning method for cardiac segmentation that improves model performance while reducing the bandwidth requirement. Our method leverages the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to regularize model weight update and reduce communication overhead. We also propose a \mymethod{} aggregation technique to address data heterogeneity among clients. This technique adaptively penalizes the aggregated weights from different clients by comparing the validation accuracy in each client, allowing better generalization performance and fast local adaptation. In-client and cross-client evaluations on public cardiac MR datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over other LoRA-based federate learning approaches.

> The rapid development of vision language models (VLMs) demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, current visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks often depend on open-ended questions, making accurate evaluation difficult due to the variability in natural language responses. To address this, we introduce AutoConverter, an agentic framework that automatically converts these open-ended questions into multiple-choice format, enabling objective evaluation while reducing the costly question creation process. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoConverter can generate correct and challenging multiple-choice questions, with VLMs demonstrating consistently similar or lower accuracy on these questions compared to human-created ones. Using AutoConverter, we construct VMCBench, a benchmark created by transforming 20 existing VQA datasets into a unified multiple-choice format, totaling 9,018 questions. We comprehensively evaluate 33 state-of-the-art VLMs on VMCBench, setting a new standard for scalable, consistent, and reproducible VLM evaluation.

> Cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising performance in solving complex math problems with a divide-and-conquer pipeline and the assistance of in-context learning (ICL) examples. However, their potential for improvement is limited by two critical problems within their ICL examples: granularity-mismatch and the ensuing negative-effect noise problem. Specifically, the LLMs are capable of the dividing process yet mostly failed by inaccurate reasoning within a few conquer steps, while the ICL examples retrieved in question-grained sometimes lack relevant steps for a specific challenging reasoning step. Further, this disconnect may hinder the correct reasoning due to its irrelevance. To this end, we focus on improving the reasoning quality within each step and present BoostStep. BoostStep aligns the granularity between the retrieving and reasoning on step grained, and provides highly related ICL examples for each reasoning step with a novel `first-try' strategy. BoostStep provides more relevant examples than the coarse question-grained strategy, enhancing the model reasoning quality within each step steadily. BoostStep is a general and robust reasoning-enhancing method that not only improves standalone reasoning performance but also integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search methods (MCTS) to refine both candidate generation and decision-making. Quantitatively, it improves GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Math-72B by 3.6\% and 2.0\% respectively on various mathematical benchmarks, and 7.5\% gain combined with MCTS.

> Although, both double-spending and selfish-mining attacks have been extensively studied since the ``Bitcoin'' whitepaper of Nakamoto and the ``majority is not enough'' paper of Eyal and Sirer, there has been no rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack that combines the two, except for the complicated MDP models. In this paper, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, there is a risk of double-spending which comes at no-cost to the adversary. The result can be seen as a guide for picking $k$ in the $k$-confirmation rule in a blockchain design. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the risk of double-spending is. We provide the minimum double-spend value needed for an attack to be profitable in the regimes where the scheme is less profitable than honest mining. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability. Finally, we evaluate the results and provide the optimal and the maximum stubbornness levels for each parameter regime as well as the revenue. As a case study, with Bitcoin's $k=6$ block confirmation rule, we evaluate the revenue and double-spending risk of the attacks for each pool parameter.

> This paper explores Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with Gaussian Splatting. While reconstructive self-supervised learning frameworks such as MAE learns good semantic abstractions, it is not trained for explicit spatial awareness. Our approach, named Gaussian Masked Autoencoder, or GMAE, aims to learn semantic abstractions and spatial understanding jointly. Like MAE, it reconstructs the image end-to-end in the pixel space, but beyond MAE, it also introduces an intermediate, 3D Gaussian-based representation and renders images via splatting. We show that GMAE can enable various zero-shot learning capabilities of spatial understanding (e.g., figure-ground segmentation, image layering, edge detection, etc.) while preserving the high-level semantics of self-supervised representation quality from MAE. To our knowledge, we are the first to employ Gaussian primitives in an image representation learning framework beyond optimization-based single-scene reconstructions. We believe GMAE will inspire further research in this direction and contribute to developing next-generation techniques for modeling high-fidelity visual data.

However, biases in training data can introduce unfairness, especially in predicting legal judgment. This study focuses on analyzing biases within the Swiss Judgment Prediction Dataset (SJP-Dataset). Our aim is to ensure unbiased factual descriptions essential for fair decision making by NLP models in legal contexts. We analyze the dataset using social bias descriptors from the Holistic Bias dataset and employ advanced NLP techniques, including attention visualization, to explore the impact of dispreferred descriptors on model predictions. The study identifies biases and examines their influence on model behavior. Challenges include dataset imbalance and token limits affecting model performance.

> Embeddings play a pivotal role in the efficacy of Large Language Models. They are the bedrock on which these models grasp contextual relationships and foster a more nuanced understanding of language and consequently perform remarkably on a plethora of complex tasks that require a fundamental understanding of human language. Given that these embeddings themselves often reflect or exhibit bias, it stands to reason that these models may also inadvertently learn this bias. In this work, we build on the seminal previous work and propose DeepSoftDebias, an algorithm that uses a neural network to perform 'soft debiasing'. We exhaustively evaluate this algorithm across a variety of SOTA datasets, accuracy metrics, and challenging NLP tasks. We find that DeepSoftDebias outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods at reducing bias across gender, race, and religion.

> Predictions in the form of probability distributions are crucial for effective decision-making. Quantile regression enables such predictions within spatial prediction settings that aim to create improved precipitation datasets by merging remote sensing and gauge data. However, ensemble learning of quantile regression algorithms remains unexplored in this context and, at the same time, it has not been substantially developed so far in the broader machine learning research landscape. Here, we introduce nine quantile-based ensemble learners and address the afore-mentioned gap in precipitation dataset creation by presenting the first application of these learners to large precipitation datasets. We employed a novel feature engineering strategy, reducing predictors to distance-weighted satellite precipitation at relevant locations, combined with location elevation. Our ensemble learners include six ensemble learning and three simple methods (mean, median, best combiner), combining six individual algorithms: quantile regression (QR), quantile regression forests (QRF), generalized random forests (GRF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), light gradient boosting machines (LightGBM), and quantile regression neural networks (QRNN). These algorithms serve as both base learners and combiners within different ensemble learning methods. We evaluated performance against a reference method (QR) using quantile scoring functions in a large dataset comprising 15 years of monthly gauge-measured and satellite precipitation in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Ensemble learning with QR and QRNN yielded the best results across quantile levels ranging from 0.025 to 0.975, outperforming the reference method by 3.91% to 8.95%. This demonstrates the potential of ensemble learning to improve probabilistic spatial predictions.

> Machine learning (ML) is a revolutionary technology with demonstrable applications across multiple disciplines. Within the Earth science community, ML has been most visible for weather forecasting, producing forecasts that rival modern physics-based models. Given the importance of deepening our understanding and improving predictions of the Earth system on all time scales, efforts are now underway to develop forecasting models into Earth-system models (ESMs), capable of representing all components of the coupled Earth system (or their aggregated behavior) and their response to external changes. Modeling the Earth system is a much more difficult problem than weather forecasting, not least because the model must represent the alternate (e.g., future) coupled states of the system for which there are no historical observations. Given that the physical principles that enable predictions about the response of the Earth system are often not explicitly coded in these ML-based models, demonstrating the credibility of ML-based ESMs thus requires us to build evidence of their consistency with the physical system. To this end, this paper puts forward five recommendations to enhance comprehensive, standardized, and independent evaluation of ML-based ESMs to strengthen their credibility and promote their wider use.

> Lithology discrimination is a crucial activity in characterizing oil reservoirs, and processing lithology microscopic images is an essential technique for investigating fossils and minerals and geological assessment of shale oil exploration. In this way, Deep Learning (DL) technique is a powerful approach for building robust classifier models. However, there is still a considerable challenge to collect and produce a large dataset. Transfer-learning and data augmentation techniques have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this problem. Furthermore, due to different reasons, especially data privacy, individuals, organizations, and industry companies often are not willing to share their sensitive data and information. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged to train a highly accurate central model across multiple decentralized edge servers without transferring sensitive data, preserving sensitive data, and enhancing security. This study involves two phases; the first phase is to conduct Lithology microscopic image classification on a small dataset using transfer learning. In doing so, various pre-trained DL model architectures are comprehensively compared for the classification task. In the second phase, we formulated the classification task to a Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) scheme and proposed a Fine-Tuned Aggregation strategy for Federated Learning (FTA-FTL). In order to perform a comprehensive experimental study, several metrics such as accuracy, f1 score, precision, specificity, sensitivity (recall), and confusion matrix are taken into account. The results are in excellent agreement and confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme, and show that the proposed FTA-FTL algorithm is capable enough to achieve approximately the same results obtained by the centralized implementation for Lithology microscopic images classification task.

The integrity of this data is fundamental to the correctness of infer-ence and decision-making in the context of maritime safety, traffic manage-ment and environmental protection. This paper analyzes the impact of data integrity in large AIS datasets, on classification accuracy. It also presents er-ror detection and correction methods and data verification techniques that can improve the reliability of AIS systems. The results show that improving the integrity of AIS data significantly improves the quality of inference, which has a direct impact on operational efficiency and safety at sea.

> The growing availability of sensors within semiconductor manufacturing processes makes it feasible to detect defective wafers with data-driven models. Without directly measuring the quality of semiconductor devices, they capture the modalities between diverse sensor readings and can be used to predict key quality indicators (KQI, \textit{e.g.}, roughness, resistance) to detect faulty products, significantly reducing the capital and human cost in maintaining physical metrology steps. Nevertheless, existing models pay little attention to the correlations among different processes for diverse wafer products and commonly struggle with generalizability issues. To enable generic fault detection, in this work, we propose a modular network (MN) trained using time series stage-wise datasets that embodies the structure of the manufacturing process. It decomposes KQI prediction as a combination of stage modules to simulate compositional semiconductor manufacturing, universally enhancing faulty wafer detection among different wafer types and manufacturing processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, and shed light on how the compositional design provides an interpretable interface for more practical applications.

> The widespread use of social media highlights the need to understand its impact, particularly the role of online social support. This study uses a dataset focused on online social support, which includes binary and multiclass classifications of social support content on social media. The classification of social support is divided into three tasks. The first task focuses on distinguishing between supportive and non-supportive. The second task aims to identify whether the support is directed toward an individual or a group. The third task categorizes the specific type of social support, grouping it into categories such as Nation, LGBTQ, Black people, Women, Religion, and Other (if it does not fit into the previously mentioned categories). To address data imbalances in these tasks, we employed K-means clustering for balancing the dataset and compared the results with the original unbalanced data. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers and zero-shot learning approaches with GPT3, GPT4, and GPT4-o, we predict social support levels in various contexts. The effectiveness of the dataset is evaluated using baseline models across different learning approaches, with transformer-based methods demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, we achieved a 0.4\% increase in the macro F1 score for the second task and a 0.7\% increase for the third task, compared to previous work utilizing traditional machine learning with psycholinguistic and unigram-based TF-IDF values.

> Despite the evident practical importance of license plate recognition (LPR), corresponding research is limited by the volume of publicly available datasets due to privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To address this challenge, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach. In this paper, we propose to synthesize realistic license plates (LPs) using diffusion models, inspired by recent advances in image and video generation. In our experiments a diffusion model was successfully trained on a Ukrainian LP dataset, and 1000 synthetic images were generated for detailed analysis. Through manual classification and annotation of the generated images, we performed a thorough study of the model output, such as success rate, character distributions, and type of failures. Our contributions include experimental validation of the efficacy of diffusion models for LP synthesis, along with insights into the characteristics of the generated data. Furthermore, we have prepared a synthetic dataset consisting of 10,000 LP images, publicly available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13342102. Conducted experiments empirically confirm the usefulness of synthetic data for the LPR task. Despite the initial performance gap between the model trained with real and synthetic data, the expansion of the training data set with pseudolabeled synthetic data leads to an improvement in LPR accuracy by 3% compared to baseline.

AutoE2E intelligently infers potential features within a web application and translates them into executable test scenarios. Furthermore, we address a critical gap in the research community by introducing E2EBench, a new benchmark for automatically assessing the feature coverage of E2E test suites. Our evaluation on E2EBench demonstrates that AutoE2E achieves an average feature coverage of 79%, outperforming the best baseline by 558%, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality, comprehensive test cases.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

> Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many fields, including software engineering (SE). The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment & operation, and system architecture & orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains.

> Increasing HPC cluster sizes and large-scale simulations that produce petabytes of data per run, create massive IO and storage challenges for analysis. Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages, freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU) simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady process in a continual manner. We detail challenges addressed while porting and scaling to Frontier exascale system.

> In federated learning (FL), heterogeneity among the local dataset distributions of clients can result in unsatisfactory performance for some, leading to an unfair model. To address this challenge, we propose an over-the-air fair federated learning algorithm (OTA-FFL), which leverages over-the-air computation to train fair FL models. By formulating FL as a multi-objective minimization problem, we introduce a modified Chebyshev approach to compute adaptive weighting coefficients for gradient aggregation in each communication round. To enable efficient aggregation over the multiple access channel, we derive analytical solutions for the optimal transmit scalars at the clients and the de-noising scalar at the parameter server. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OTA-FFL in achieving fairness and robust performance compared to existing methods.

> Importance sampling is a rare event simulation technique used in Monte Carlo simulations to bias the sampling distribution towards the rare event of interest. By assigning appropriate weights to sampled points, importance sampling allows for more efficient estimation of rare events or tails of distributions. However, importance sampling can fail when the proposal distribution does not effectively cover the target distribution. In this work, we propose a method for more efficient sampling by updating the proposal distribution in the latent space of a normalizing flow. Normalizing flows learn an invertible mapping from a target distribution to a simpler latent distribution. The latent space can be more easily explored during the search for a proposal distribution, and samples from the proposal distribution are recovered in the space of the target distribution via the invertible mapping. We empirically validate our methodology on simulated robotics applications such as autonomous racing and aircraft ground collision avoidance.

> The reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on a wide range of problems critically relies on chain-of-thought prompting, which involves providing a few chain of thought demonstrations as exemplars in prompts. Recent work, e.g., Tree of Thoughts, has pointed out the importance of exploration and self-evaluation in reasoning step selection for complex problem solving. In this paper, we present Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts in order to acquire an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, which will serve as a new form of prompting to solve the complex problem. Starting from a simple prompt without requiring examples, BoT iteratively explores and evaluates a large collection of reasoning steps, and more importantly, uses error analysis obtained from the LLM on them to explicitly revise prompting, which in turn enhances reasoning step generation, until a final answer is attained. Our experiments with GPT-4 and Llama2 across extensive complex mathematical problems demonstrate that BoT consistently achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than other advanced prompting approaches.

> This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.

> The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure is widely used to control the false detection rate (FDR) in multiple testing. Applications of this control abound in drug discovery, forensics, anomaly detection, and, in particular, machine learning, ranging from nonparametric outlier detection to out-of-distribution detection and one-class classification methods. Considering this control could be relied upon in critical safety/security contexts, we investigate its adversarial robustness. More precisely, we study under what conditions BH does and does not exhibit adversarial robustness, we present a class of simple and easily implementable adversarial test-perturbation algorithms, and we perform computational experiments. With our algorithms, we demonstrate that there are conditions under which BH's control can be significantly broken with relatively few (even just one) test score perturbation(s), and provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the expected adversarial-adjustment to FDR. Our technical analysis involves a combinatorial reframing of the BH procedure as a ``balls into bins'' process, and drawing a connection to generalized ballot problems to facilitate an information-theoretic approach for deriving non-asymptotic lower bounds.

> We present a unified dataset for document Question-Answering (QA), which is obtained combining several public datasets related to Document AI and visually rich document understanding (VRDU). Our main contribution is twofold: on the one hand we reformulate existing Document AI tasks, such as Information Extraction (IE), into a Question-Answering task, making it a suitable resource for training and evaluating Large Language Models; on the other hand, we release the OCR of all the documents and include the exact position of the answer to be found in the document image as a bounding box. Using this dataset, we explore the impact of different prompting techniques (that might include bounding box information) on the performance of open-weight models, identifying the most effective approaches for document comprehension.

> This paper presents a novel machine-learning framework for reconstructing low-order gust-encounter flow field and lift coefficients from sparse, noisy surface pressure measurements. Our study thoroughly investigates the time-varying response of sensors to gust-airfoil interactions, uncovering valuable insights into optimal sensor placement. To address uncertainties in deep learning predictions, we implement probabilistic regression strategies to model both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Epistemic uncertainty, reflecting the model's confidence in its predictions, is modeled using Monte Carlo dropout, as an approximation to the variational inference in the Bayesian framework, treating the neural network as a stochastic entity. On the other hand, aleatoric uncertainty, arising from noisy input measurements, is captured via learned statistical parameters, which propagates measurement noise through the network into the final predictions. Our results showcase the efficacy of this dual uncertainty quantification strategy in accurately predicting aerodynamic behavior under extreme conditions while maintaining computational efficiency, underscoring its potential to improve online sensor-based flow estimation in real-world applications.

> Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven an explosion of interest about their societal impacts. Much of the discourse around how they will impact social equity has been cautionary or negative, focusing on questions like "how might LLMs be biased and how would we mitigate those biases?" This is a vital discussion: the ways in which AI generally, and LLMs specifically, can entrench biases have been well-documented. But equally vital, and much less discussed, is the more opportunity-focused counterpoint: "what promising applications do LLMs enable that could promote equity?" If LLMs are to enable a more equitable world, it is not enough just to play defense against their biases and failure modes. We must also go on offense, applying them positively to equity-enhancing use cases to increase opportunities for underserved groups and reduce societal discrimination. There are many choices which determine the impact of AI, and a fundamental choice very early in the pipeline is the problems we choose to apply it to. If we focus only later in the pipeline -- making LLMs marginally more fair as they facilitate use cases which intrinsically entrench power -- we will miss an important opportunity to guide them to equitable impacts. Here, we highlight the emerging potential of LLMs to promote equity by presenting four newly possible, promising research directions, while keeping risks and cautionary points in clear view.

> Classical information design models (e.g., Bayesian persuasion and cheap talk) require players to have perfect knowledge of the prior distribution of the state of the world. Our paper studies repeated persuasion problems in which the information designer does not know the prior. The information designer learns to design signaling schemes from repeated interactions with the receiver. We design learning algorithms for the information designer to achieve no regret compared to using the optimal signaling scheme with known prior, under two models of the receiver's decision-making. (1) The first model assumes that the receiver knows the prior and can perform posterior update and best respond to signals. In this model, we design a learning algorithm for the information designer with $O(\log T)$ regret in the general case, and another algorithm with $\Theta(\log \log T)$ regret in the case where the receiver has only two actions. (2) The second model assumes that the receiver does not know the prior and employs a no-regret learning algorithm to take actions. We show that the information designer can achieve regret $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{rReg}(T) T})$, where $\mathrm{rReg}(T)=o(T)$ is an upper bound on the receiver's learning regret. Our work thus provides a learning foundation for the problem of information design with unknown prior.

These difficulties are even more pronounced when addressing multi-table data linked via foreign key, which is prevalent in the enterprise realm and crucial for empowering business use cases. Despite its substantial impact, research focusing on such linked business tables within enterprise settings remains a significantly important yet underexplored domain. To address this, we introduce a curated dataset sourced from an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, featuring extensive linked tables. This dataset is specifically designed to support research endeavors in table representation learning. By providing access to authentic enterprise data, our goal is to potentially enhance the effectiveness and applicability of models for real-world business contexts.

> Tactile and visual perception are both crucial for humans to perform fine-grained interactions with their environment. Developing similar multi-modal sensing capabilities for robots can significantly enhance and expand their manipulation skills. This paper introduces \textbf{3D-ViTac}, a multi-modal sensing and learning system designed for dexterous bimanual manipulation. Our system features tactile sensors equipped with dense sensing units, each covering an area of 3$mm^2$. These sensors are low-cost and flexible, providing detailed and extensive coverage of physical contacts, effectively complementing visual information. To integrate tactile and visual data, we fuse them into a unified 3D representation space that preserves their 3D structures and spatial relationships. The multi-modal representation can then be coupled with diffusion policies for imitation learning. Through concrete hardware experiments, we demonstrate that even low-cost robots can perform precise manipulations and significantly outperform vision-only policies, particularly in safe interactions with fragile items and executing long-horizon tasks involving in-hand manipulation.

> We present an efficient tensor-network-based approach for simulating large-scale quantum circuits, demonstrated using Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs). Our method effectively reduces exponential runtime growth to near-quadratic scaling with respect to the number of qubits in practical scenarios. Traditional state-vector simulations become computationally infeasible beyond approximately 50 qubits; in contrast, our simulator successfully handles QSVMs with up to 784 qubits, completing simulations within seconds on a single high-performance GPU. Furthermore, by employing the Message Passing Interface (MPI) in multi-GPU environments, the approach shows strong linear scalability, reducing computation time as dataset size increases. We validate the framework on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving successful multiclass classification and emphasizing the potential of QSVMs for high-dimensional data analysis. By integrating tensor-network techniques with high-performance computing resources, this work demonstrates both the feasibility and scalability of large-qubit quantum machine learning models, providing a valuable validation tool in the emerging Quantum-HPC ecosystem.

> Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a robust security mechanism that enforces mandatory access controls (MAC), but its policy language's complexity creates challenges for policy analysis and management. This research investigates the automation of SELinux policy analysis using graph-based techniques combined with machine learning approaches to detect policy anomalies. The study addresses two key questions: Can SELinux policy analysis be automated through graph analysis, and how do different anomaly detection models compare in analyzing SELinux policies? We will be comparing different machine learning models by evaluating their effectiveness in detecting policy violations and anomalies. Our approach utilizes Neo4j for graph representation of policies, with Node2vec transforming these graph structures into meaningful vector embeddings that can be processed by our machine learning models. In our results, the MLP Neural Network consistently demonstrated superior performance across different dataset sizes, achieving 95% accuracy with balanced precision and recall metrics, while both Random Forest and SVM models showed competitive but slightly lower performance in detecting policy violations. This combination of graph-based modeling and machine learning provides a more sophisticated and automated approach to understanding and analyzing complex SELinux policies compared to traditional manual analysis methods.

> Bilevel optimization enjoys a wide range of applications in emerging machine learning and signal processing problems such as hyper-parameter optimization, image reconstruction, meta-learning, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. However, bilevel optimization problems are traditionally known to be difficult to solve. Recent progress on bilevel algorithms mainly focuses on bilevel optimization problems through the lens of the implicit-gradient method, where the lower-level objective is either strongly convex or unconstrained. In this work, we tackle a challenging class of bilevel problems through the lens of the penalty method. We show that under certain conditions, the penalty reformulation recovers the (local) solutions of the original bilevel problem. Further, we propose the penalty-based bilevel gradient descent (PBGD) algorithm and establish its finite-time convergence for the constrained bilevel problem with lower-level constraints yet without lower-level strong convexity. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets showcase the efficiency of the proposed PBGD algorithm.

> Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge when adapting large language models (LLMs) to new tasks or domains. Conventional fine-tuning often overwrites existing knowledge, causing performance degradation on original tasks. We introduce Superposition in Transformers, a novel architecture that leverages autoencoders to superimpose the hidden representations of a base model and a fine-tuned model within a shared parameter space. By using B-spline-based blending coefficients and autoencoders that adaptively reconstruct hidden states based on the input data distribution, our method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables a new paradigm of "in-model" superposition. This approach preserves original model capabilities while allowing compact domain-specific expertise to be added, and it supports dynamic switching between model states during inference.

> The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

> The development of unbiased large language models is widely recognized as crucial, yet existing benchmarks fall short in detecting biases due to limited scope, contamination, and lack of a fairness baseline. SAGED(bias) is the first holistic benchmarking pipeline to address these problems. The pipeline encompasses five core stages: scraping materials, assembling benchmarks, generating responses, extracting numeric features, and diagnosing with disparity metrics. SAGED includes metrics for max disparity, such as impact ratio, and bias concentration, such as Max Z-scores. Noticing that metric tool bias and contextual bias in prompts can distort evaluation, SAGED implements counterfactual branching and baseline calibration for mitigation. For demonstration, we use SAGED on G20 Countries with popular 8b-level models including Gemma2, Llama3.1, Mistral, and Qwen2. With sentiment analysis, we find that while Mistral and Qwen2 show lower max disparity and higher bias concentration than Gemma2 and Llama3.1, all models are notably biased against countries like Russia and (except for Qwen2) China. With further experiments to have models role-playing U.S. presidents, we see bias amplifies and shifts in heterogeneous directions. Moreover, we see Qwen2 and Mistral not engage in role-playing, while Llama3.1 and Gemma2 role-play Trump notably more intensively than Biden and Harris, indicating role-playing performance bias in these models.

> The Large Hadron Collider at CERN produces immense volumes of complex data from high-energy particle collisions, demanding sophisticated analytical techniques for effective interpretation. Neural Networks, including Graph Neural Networks, have shown promise in tasks such as event classification and object identification by representing collisions as graphs. However, while Graph Neural Networks excel in predictive accuracy, their "black box" nature often limits their interpretability, making it difficult to trust their decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a Graph Transformer model with Mixture-of-Expert layers to achieve high predictive performance while embedding interpretability into the architecture. By leveraging attention maps and expert specialization, the model offers insights into its internal decision-making, linking predictions to physics-informed features. We evaluate the model on simulated events from the ATLAS experiment, focusing on distinguishing rare Supersymmetric signal events from Standard Model background. Our results highlight that the model achieves competitive classification accuracy while providing interpretable outputs that align with known physics, demonstrating its potential as a robust and transparent tool for high-energy physics data analysis. This approach underscores the importance of explainability in machine learning methods applied to high energy physics, offering a path toward greater trust in AI-driven discoveries.

Finally, we demonstrate a robust model that can detect humanized AI text while maintaining a low false positive rate using a data-centric augmentation approach. We attack our own detector, training our own fine-tuned model optimized against our detector's predictions, and show that our detector's cross-humanizer generalization is sufficient to remain robust to this attack.

> Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences. However, directly collecting human preferences can be expensive, time-consuming, and can have high variance. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations as they are more consistent, cheaper, and scale better than human annotation; however, they are also prone to biases and errors. In this work, we introduce a routing framework that combines inputs from humans and LMs to achieve better annotation quality, while reducing the total cost of human annotation. The crux of our approach is to identify preference instances that will benefit from human annotations. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we train a performance prediction model to predict a reward model's performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes predicted performance. We train the performance prediction model on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10K instances paired with human and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid mixture of LM and direct human preferences using our routing framework achieves better reward model performance compared to using either one exclusively. We simulate selective human preference collection on three other datasets and show that our method generalizes well to all three. We analyze features from the routing model to identify characteristics of instances that can benefit from human feedback, e.g., prompts with a moderate safety concern or moderate intent complexity. We release the dataset, annotation platform, and source code used in this study to foster more efficient and accurate preference collection in the future.

> Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on datasets consisting of fixed-length token sequences. These datasets are created by randomly concatenating documents of various lengths and then chunking them into sequences of a predetermined target length (concat-and-chunk). Recent attention implementations mask cross-document attention, reducing the effective length of a chunk of tokens. Additionally, training on long sequences becomes computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of attention. In this study, we introduce dataset decomposition, a novel variable sequence length training technique, to tackle these challenges. We decompose a dataset into a union of buckets, each containing sequences of the same size extracted from a unique document. During training, we use variable sequence length and batch-size, sampling simultaneously from all buckets with a curriculum. In contrast to the concat-and-chunk baseline, which incurs a fixed attention cost at every step of training, our proposed method incurs a computational cost proportional to the actual document lengths at each step, resulting in significant savings in training time. We train an 8k context-length 1B model at the same cost as a 2k context-length model trained with the baseline approach. Experiments on a web-scale corpus demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances performance on standard language evaluations and long-context benchmarks, reaching target accuracy with up to 6x faster training compared to the baseline. Our method not only enables efficient pretraining on long sequences but also scales effectively with dataset size. Lastly, we shed light on a critical yet less studied aspect of training large language models: the distribution and curriculum of sequence lengths, which results in a non-negligible difference in performance.

> Maintaining a "green" mainline branch, where all builds pass successfully, is crucial but challenging in fast-paced, large-scale software development environments, particularly with concurrent code changes in large monorepos. SubmitQueue, a system designed to address these challenges, speculatively executes builds and only lands changes with successful outcomes. However, despite its effectiveness, the system faces inefficiencies in resource utilization, leading to a high rate of premature build aborts and delays in landing smaller changes blocked by larger conflicting ones. This paper introduces enhancements to SubmitQueue, focusing on optimizing resource usage and improving build prioritization. Central to this is our innovative probabilistic model, which distinguishes between changes with shorter and longer build times to prioritize builds for more efficient scheduling. By leveraging a machine learning model to predict build times and incorporating this into the probabilistic framework, we expedite the landing of smaller changes blocked by conflicting larger time-consuming changes. Additionally, introducing a concept of speculation threshold ensures that only the most likely builds are executed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption. After implementing these enhancements across Uber's major monorepos (Go, iOS, and Android), we observed a reduction in Continuous Integration (CI) resource usage by approximately 53%, CPU usage by 44%, and P95 waiting times by 37%. These improvements highlight the enhanced efficiency of SubmitQueue in managing large-scale software changes while maintaining a green mainline.

> As chatbots become increasingly integrated into everyday tasks, designing systems that accommodate diverse user populations is crucial for fostering trust, engagement, and inclusivity. This study investigates the ability of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and evaluates the impact of AAVE usage on user experiences in chatbot applications. We analyze the performance of three LLM families (Llama, GPT, and Claude) in producing AAVE-like utterances at varying dialect intensities and assess user preferences across multiple domains, including healthcare and education. Despite LLMs' proficiency in generating AAVE-like language, findings indicate that AAVE-speaking users prefer Standard American English (SAE) chatbots, with higher levels of AAVE correlating with lower ratings for a variety of characteristics, including chatbot trustworthiness and role appropriateness. These results highlight the complexities of creating inclusive AI systems and underscore the need for further exploration of diversity to enhance human-computer interactions.

> This article introduces the concept of optimization learning, a methodology to design optimization proxies that learn the input/output mapping of parametric optimization problems. These optimization proxies are trustworthy by design: they compute feasible solutions to the underlying optimization problems, provide quality guarantees on the returned solutions, and scale to large instances. Optimization proxies are differentiable programs that combine traditional deep learning technology with repair or completion layers to produce feasible solutions. The article shows that optimization proxies can be trained end-to-end in a self-supervised way. It presents methodologies to provide performance guarantees and to scale optimization proxies to large-scale optimization problems. The potential of optimization proxies is highlighted through applications in power systems and, in particular, real-time risk assessment and security-constrained optimal power flow.

- *Samuel Sisk, Xiaosong Du*

- `2501.03445v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03445v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03445v1)

> To aid urban air mobility (UAM), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft are being targeted. Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.

> Cryptocurrency investment is inherently difficult due to its shorter history compared to traditional assets, the need to integrate vast amounts of data from various modalities, and the requirement for complex reasoning. While deep learning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their black-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due to their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable decisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive tasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in their training corpora.   To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses specialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks such as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making for the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training module fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional investment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs real-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique intrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by adjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and facilitating information sharing between teams. Empirical evaluation using data from November 2023 to September 2024 demonstrates that our framework outperforms single-agent models and market benchmarks in classification, asset pricing, portfolio, and explainability performance.

> Software vulnerabilities continue to be ubiquitous, even in the era of AI-powered code assistants, advanced static analysis tools, and the adoption of extensive testing frameworks. It has become apparent that we must not simply prevent these bugs, but also eliminate them in a quick, efficient manner. Yet, human code intervention is slow, costly, and can often lead to further security vulnerabilities, especially in legacy codebases. The advent of highly advanced Large Language Models (LLM) has opened up the possibility for many software defects to be patched automatically. We propose LLM4CVE an LLM-based iterative pipeline that robustly fixes vulnerable functions in real-world code with high accuracy. We examine our pipeline with State-of-the-Art LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 38B, and Llama 3 70B. We achieve a human-verified quality score of 8.51/10 and an increase in groundtruth code similarity of 20% with Llama 3 70B. To promote further research in the area of LLM-based vulnerability repair, we publish our testing apparatus, fine-tuned weights, and experimental data on our website

> The widespread adoption of deep learning across various industries has introduced substantial challenges, particularly in terms of model explainability and security. The inherent complexity of deep learning models, while contributing to their effectiveness, also renders them susceptible to adversarial attacks. Among these, backdoor attacks are especially concerning, as they involve surreptitiously embedding specific triggers within training data, causing the model to exhibit aberrant behavior when presented with input containing the triggers. Such attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in outsourced processes, compromising model integrity without affecting performance on clean (trigger-free) input data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies designed to counter backdoor attacks in image recognition. We provide an in-depth analysis of the theoretical foundations, practical efficacy, and limitations of these approaches. In addition, we conduct an extensive benchmarking of sixteen state-of-the-art approaches against eight distinct backdoor attacks, utilizing three datasets, four model architectures, and three poisoning ratios. Our results, derived from 122,236 individual experiments, indicate that while many approaches provide some level of protection, their performance can vary considerably. Furthermore, when compared to two seminal approaches, most newer approaches do not demonstrate substantial improvements in overall performance or consistency across diverse settings. Drawing from these findings, we propose potential directions for developing more effective and generalizable defensive mechanisms in the future.

- `2501.03447v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03447v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03447v1)

> Large language models that enhance software development tasks, such as code generation, code completion, and code question answering (QA), have been extensively studied in both academia and the industry. The models are integrated into popular intelligent IDEs like JetBrains and Cursor. Current benchmarks for evaluating models' code comprehension capabilities primarily focus on code generation or completion, often neglecting QA, which is a crucial aspect of understanding code. Existing code QA benchmarks are derived from code comments with predefined patterns (e.g., CodeQA) or focus on specific domains, such as education (e.g., CS1QA). These benchmarks fail to capture the real-world complexity of software engineering and user requirements for understanding code repositories. To address this gap, we introduce CoReQA, a benchmark for Code Repository-level question answering, constructed from GitHub issues and comments from 176 popular repositories across four programming languages. Since questions and answers may include both natural language and code snippets, traditional evaluation metrics such as BLEU are inadequate for assessing repository-level QA performance. Thus, we provide an LLM-as-a-judge framework to evaluate QA performance from five aspects. Based on CoReQA, we evaluate the performance of three baselines, including two short-context models using generic retrieval strategies and one long-context model that utilizes the entire repository context. Evaluation results show that state-of-the-art proprietary and long-context models struggle to address repository-level questions effectively. Our analysis highlights the limitations of language models in assisting developers in understanding repositories and suggests future directions for improving repository comprehension systems through effective context retrieval methodologies.

> Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its distributed nature and privacy preserving benefits. However, a key limitation of conventional FL is that it learns and distributes a common global model to all participants, which fails to provide customized solutions for diverse task requirements. Federated meta-learning (FML) offers a promising solution to this issue by enabling devices to finetune local models after receiving a shared meta-model from the server. In this paper, we propose a task-oriented FML framework over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. A novel metric, termed value of learning (VoL), is introduced to assess the individual training needs across devices. Moreover, a task-level weight (TLW) metric is defined based on task requirements and fairness considerations, guiding the prioritization of edge devices during FML training. The formulated problem, to maximize the sum of TLW-based VoL across devices, forms a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) challenge, addressed here using a parameterized deep Q-network (PDQN) algorithm to handle both discrete and continuous variables. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline schemes, underscoring the advantages of the proposed framework.

> Graph embedding generation techniques aim to learn low-dimensional vectors for each node in a graph and have recently gained increasing research attention. Publishing low-dimensional node vectors enables various graph analysis tasks, such as structural equivalence and link prediction. Yet, improper publication opens a backdoor to malicious attackers, who can infer sensitive information of individuals from the low-dimensional node vectors. Existing methods tackle this issue by developing deep graph learning models with differential privacy (DP). However, they often suffer from large noise injections and cannot provide structural preferences consistent with mining objectives. Recently, skip-gram based graph embedding generation techniques are widely used due to their ability to extract customizable structures. Based on skip-gram, we present SE-PrivGEmb, a structure-preference enabled graph embedding generation under DP. For arbitrary structure preferences, we design a unified noise tolerance mechanism via perturbing non-zero vectors. This mechanism mitigates utility degradation caused by high sensitivity. By carefully designing negative sampling probabilities in skip-gram, we theoretically demonstrate that skip-gram can preserve arbitrary proximities, which quantify structural features in graphs. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under structural equivalence and link prediction tasks.

> The advancement of single-cell sequencing technology has promoted the generation of a large amount of single-cell transcriptional profiles, providing unprecedented opportunities to identify drug-resistant cell subpopulations within a tumor. However, few studies have focused on drug response prediction at single-cell level, and their performance remains suboptimal. This paper proposed scAdaDrug, a novel multi-source domain adaptation model powered by adaptive importance-aware representation learning to predict drug response of individual cells. We used a shared encoder to extract domain-invariant features related to drug response from multiple source domains by utilizing adversarial domain adaptation. Particularly, we introduced a plug-and-play module to generate importance-aware and mutually independent weights, which could adaptively modulate the latent representation of each sample in element-wise manner between source and target domains. Extensive experimental results showed that our model achieved state-of-the-art performance in predicting drug response on multiple independent datasets, including single-cell datasets derived from both cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models, as well as clinical tumor patient cohorts. Moreover, the ablation experiments demonstrated our model effectively captured the underlying patterns determining drug response from multiple source domains.

> In this study, we explore the use of a transformer-based language model as an encoder to predict the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from their text descriptions. Quantum chemistry simulations, including Density Functional Theory (DFT), are computationally intensive and time-consuming, which limits their practicality for high-throughput material screening, particularly for complex systems. Shallow machine learning (ML) models, while effective, often require extensive data preprocessing to convert non-numerical material properties into numerical inputs. In contrast, our approach leverages textual data directly, bypassing the need for complex feature engineering. We generate material descriptions in two formats: formatted strings combining features and natural language text generated using the ChatGPT API. We demonstrate that the RoBERTa model, pre-trained on natural language processing tasks, performs effectively as an encoder for prediction tasks. With minimal fine-tuning, it achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.33 eV, performing better than shallow machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Even when only the linear regression head is trained while keeping the RoBERTa encoder layers frozen, the accuracy remains nearly identical to that of the fully trained model. This demonstrates that the pre-trained RoBERTa encoder is highly adaptable for processing domain-specific text related to material properties, such as the band gap, significantly reducing the need for extensive retraining. This study highlights the potential of transformer-based language models to serve as efficient and versatile encoders for semiconductor materials property prediction tasks.

> X-ray image based medical report generation achieves significant progress in recent years with the help of the large language model, however, these models have not fully exploited the effective information in visual image regions, resulting in reports that are linguistically sound but insufficient in describing key diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel associative memory-enhanced X-ray report generation model that effectively mimics the process of professional doctors writing medical reports. It considers both the mining of global and local visual information and associates historical report information to better complete the writing of the current report. Specifically, given an X-ray image, we first utilize a classification model along with its activation maps to accomplish the mining of visual regions highly associated with diseases and the learning of disease query tokens. Then, we employ a visual Hopfield network to establish memory associations for disease-related tokens, and a report Hopfield network to retrieve report memory information. This process facilitates the generation of high-quality reports based on a large language model and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including the IU X-ray, MIMIC-CXR, and Chexpert Plus.

> Automatic radar signal recognition (RSR) plays a pivotal role in electronic warfare (EW), as accurately classifying radar signals is critical for informing decision-making processes. Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in improving RSR performance in domains with ample annotated data. However, these methods fall short in EW scenarios where annotated RF data are scarce or impractical to obtain. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) method which utilises masked signal modelling and RF domain adaption to enhance RSR performance in environments with limited RF samples and labels. Specifically, we investigate pre-training masked autoencoders (MAE) on baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) signals from various RF domains and subsequently transfer the learned representation to the radar domain, where annotated data are limited. Empirical results show that our lightweight self-supervised ResNet model with domain adaptation achieves up to a 17.5\% improvement in 1-shot classification accuracy when pre-trained on in-domain signals (i.e., radar signals) and up to a 16.31\% improvement when pre-trained on out-of-domain signals (i.e., comm signals), compared to its baseline without SSL. We also provide reference results for several MAE designs and pre-training strategies, establishing a new benchmark for few-shot radar signal classification.

> As language models grow more influential and trusted in our society, our ability to reliably steer them toward favorable behaviors becomes increasingly paramount. For this, we investigate the technique of steering vectors: biasing the forward pass of language models using a "steering vector" derived from a specific task. We apply them to steer language models toward performing Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning without the need to prompt through natural language. We demonstrate this approach on Llama3 8b and Mistral 7b v0.2, and obtain competitive results compared to CoT-prompted performances on a series of reasoning benchmarks (GSM8k, MMLU, AGI Eval, ARC AI2) and qualitative examples. We find this approach yields consistent steering towards CoT responses and takes less compute than traditional methods of fine-tuning models towards CoT.

> State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

> Vocabulary acquisition is essential to second language learning, as it underpins all core language skills. Accurate vocabulary assessment is particularly important in standardized exams, where test items evaluate learners' comprehension and contextual use of words. Previous research has explored methods for generating distractors to aid in the design of English vocabulary tests. However, current approaches often rely on lexical databases or predefined rules, and frequently produce distractors that risk invalidating the question by introducing multiple correct options. In this study, we focus on English vocabulary questions from Taiwan's university entrance exams. We analyze student response distributions to gain insights into the characteristics of these test items and provide a reference for future research. Additionally, we identify key limitations in how large language models (LLMs) support teachers in generating distractors for vocabulary test design. To address these challenges, we propose the iterative selection with self-review (ISSR) framework, which makes use of a novel LLM-based self-review mechanism to ensure that the distractors remain valid while offering diverse options. Experimental results show that ISSR achieves promising performance in generating plausible distractors, and the self-review mechanism effectively filters out distractors that could invalidate the question.

> Transformers have set new benchmarks in audio processing tasks, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture complex patterns and dependencies within audio data. However, their focus on pairwise interactions limits their ability to process the higher-order relations essential for identifying distinct audio objects. To address this limitation, this work introduces the Local- Higher Order Graph Neural Network (LHGNN), a graph based model that enhances feature understanding by integrating local neighbourhood information with higher-order data from Fuzzy C-Means clusters, thereby capturing a broader spectrum of audio relationships. Evaluation of the model on three publicly available audio datasets shows that it outperforms Transformer-based models across all benchmarks while operating with substantially fewer parameters. Moreover, LHGNN demonstrates a distinct advantage in scenarios lacking ImageNet pretraining, establishing its effectiveness and efficiency in environments where extensive pretraining data is unavailable.

> LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks, enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06 kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B. Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource utilization on the ICN was minimal.

> Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently become a very popular task for Large Language Models (LLMs). Evaluating them on multi-turn RAG conversations, where the system is asked to generate a response to a question in the context of a preceding conversation is an important and often overlooked task with several additional challenges. We present MTRAG: an end-to-end human-generated multi-turn RAG benchmark that reflects several real-world properties across diverse dimensions for evaluating the full RAG pipeline. MTRAG contains 110 conversations averaging 7.7 turns each across four domains for a total of 842 tasks. We also explore automation paths via synthetic data and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. Our human and automatic evaluations show that even state-of-the-art LLM RAG systems struggle on MTRAG. We demonstrate the need for strong retrieval and generation systems that can handle later turns, unanswerable questions, non-standalone questions, and multiple domains.

> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) have propelled the evolution of multi-modal AI systems, which have demonstrated the remarkable potential for industrial applications by emulating human-like cognition. However, they also pose significant ethical challenges, including amplifying harmful content and reinforcing societal biases. For instance, biases in some industrial image generation models highlighted the urgent need for robust fairness assessments. Most existing evaluation frameworks focus on the comprehensiveness of various aspects of the models, but they exhibit critical limitations, including insufficient attention to content generation alignment and social bias-sensitive domains. More importantly, their reliance on pixel-detection techniques is prone to inaccuracies.   To address these issues, this paper presents INFELM, an in-depth fairness evaluation on widely-used text-to-image models. Our key contributions are: (1) an advanced skintone classifier incorporating facial topology and refined skin pixel representation to enhance classification precision by at least 16.04%, (2) a bias-sensitive content alignment measurement for understanding societal impacts, (3) a generalizable representation bias evaluation for diverse demographic groups, and (4) extensive experiments analyzing large-scale text-to-image model outputs across six social-bias-sensitive domains. We find that existing models in the study generally do not meet the empirical fairness criteria, and representation bias is generally more pronounced than alignment errors. INFELM establishes a robust benchmark for fairness assessment, supporting the development of multi-modal AI systems that align with ethical and human-centric principles.

> Online linear programming plays an important role in both revenue management and resource allocation, and recent research has focused on developing efficient first-order online learning algorithms. Despite the empirical success of first-order methods, they typically achieve a regret no better than $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, which is suboptimal compared to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ bound guaranteed by the state-of-the-art linear programming (LP)-based online algorithms. This paper establishes several important facts about online linear programming, which unveils the challenge for first-order-method-based online algorithms to achieve beyond $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. To address the challenge, we introduce a new algorithmic framework that decouples learning from decision-making. For the first time, we show that first-order methods can attain regret $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$ with this new framework.

> In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.

> Binary Neural Network (BNN) converts full-precision weights and activations into their extreme 1-bit counterparts, making it particularly suitable for deployment on lightweight mobile devices. While binary neural networks are typically formulated as a constrained optimization problem and optimized in the binarized space, general neural networks are formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem and optimized in the continuous space. This paper introduces the Hyperbolic Binary Neural Network (HBNN) by leveraging the framework of hyperbolic geometry to optimize the constrained problem. Specifically, we transform the constrained problem in hyperbolic space into an unconstrained one in Euclidean space using the Riemannian exponential map. On the other hand, we also propose the Exponential Parametrization Cluster (EPC) method, which, compared to the Riemannian exponential map, shrinks the segment domain based on a diffeomorphism. This approach increases the probability of weight flips, thereby maximizing the information gain in BNNs. Experimental results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet classification datasets with VGGsmall, ResNet18, and ResNet34 models illustrate the superior performance of our HBNN over state-of-the-art methods.

> Queries to large language models (LLMs) can be divided into two parts: the instruction/question and the accompanying context. The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia or Wikipedia-like texts which are written in a neutral and factual tone. However, when RAG systems retrieve internet-based content, they encounter text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, introducing challenges for downstream tasks. The Reading with Intent task addresses this issue by evaluating how varying tones in context passages affect model performance. Building on prior work that focused on sarcasm, we extend this paradigm by constructing a dataset where context passages are transformed to $11$ distinct emotions using a better synthetic data generation approach. Using this dataset, we train an emotion translation model to systematically adapt passages to specified emotional tones. The human evaluation shows that the LLM fine-tuned to become the emotion-translator benefited from the synthetically generated data. Finally, the emotion-translator is used in the Reading with Intent task to transform the passages to a neutral tone. By neutralizing the passages, it mitigates the challenges posed by sarcastic passages and improves overall results on this task by about $3\%$.

> Increasing privacy concerns and unrestricted access to data lead to the development of a novel machine learning paradigm called Federated Learning (FL). FL borrows many of the ideas from distributed machine learning, however, the challenges associated with federated learning makes it an interesting engineering problem since the models are trained on edge devices. It was introduced in 2016 by Google, and since then active research is being carried out in different areas within FL such as federated optimization algorithms, model and update compression, differential privacy, robustness, and attacks, federated GANs and privacy preserved personalization. There are many open challenges in the development of such federated machine learning systems and this project will be focusing on the communication bottleneck and data Non IID-ness, and its effect on the performance of the models. These issues are characterized on a baseline model, model performance is evaluated, and discussions are made to overcome these issues.

> Linear discriminant analysis is a widely used method for classification. However, the high dimensionality of predictors combined with small sample sizes often results in large classification errors. To address this challenge, it is crucial to leverage data from related source models to enhance the classification performance of a target model. We propose to address this problem in the framework of transfer learning.   In this paper, we present novel transfer learning methods via regularized random-effects linear discriminant analysis, where the discriminant direction is estimated as a weighted combination of ridge estimates obtained from both the target and source models. Multiple strategies for determining these weights are introduced and evaluated, including one that minimizes the estimation risk of the discriminant vector and another that minimizes the classification error. Utilizing results from random matrix theory, we explicitly derive the asymptotic values of these weights and the associated classification error rates in the high-dimensional setting, where $p/n \rightarrow \gamma$, with $p$ representing the predictor dimension and $n$ the sample size. We also provide geometric interpretations of various weights and a guidance on which weights to choose. Extensive numerical studies, including simulations and analysis of proteomics-based 10-year cardiovascular disease risk classification, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

This paper presents a large-scale, cross-linguistic exploration of usage of honorific pronouns in Bengali and Hindi Wikipedia articles, shedding light on how socio-cultural factors shape language. Using LLM (GPT-4o), we annotated 10, 000 articles of real and fictional beings in each language for several sociodemographic features such as gender, age, fame, and exoticness, and the use of honorifics. We find that across all feature combinations, use of honorifics is consistently more common in Bengali than Hindi. For both languages, the use non-honorific pronouns is more commonly observed for infamous, juvenile, and exotic beings. Notably, we observe a gender bias in use of honorifics in Hindi, with men being more commonly referred to with honorifics than women.

> Complex visual reasoning remains a key challenge today. Typically, the challenge is tackled using methodologies such as Chain of Thought (COT) and visual instruction tuning. However, how to organically combine these two methodologies for greater success remains unexplored. Also, issues like hallucinations and high training cost still need to be addressed. In this work, we devise an innovative multi-round training and reasoning framework suitable for lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our self-questioning approach heuristically guides MLLMs to focus on visual clues relevant to the target problem, reducing hallucinations and enhancing the model's ability to describe fine-grained image details. This ultimately enables the model to perform well in complex visual reasoning and question-answering tasks. We have named this framework Socratic Questioning(SQ). To facilitate future research, we create a multimodal mini-dataset named CapQA, which includes 1k images of fine-grained activities, for visual instruction tuning and evaluation, our proposed SQ method leads to a 31.2% improvement in the hallucination score. Our extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate SQ's remarkable capabilities in heuristic self-questioning, zero-shot visual reasoning and hallucination mitigation. Our model and code will be publicly available.

> Remote physiological signal measurement based on facial videos, also known as remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), involves predicting changes in facial vascular blood flow from facial videos. While most deep learning-based methods have achieved good results, they often struggle to balance performance across small and large-scale datasets due to the inherent limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer. In this paper, we introduce VidFormer, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates 3-Dimension Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) and Transformer models for rPPG tasks. Initially, we conduct an analysis of the traditional skin reflection model and subsequently introduce an enhanced model for the reconstruction of rPPG signals. Based on this improved model, VidFormer utilizes 3DCNN and Transformer to extract local and global features from input data, respectively. To enhance the spatiotemporal feature extraction capabilities of VidFormer, we incorporate temporal-spatial attention mechanisms tailored for both 3DCNN and Transformer. Additionally, we design a module to facilitate information exchange and fusion between the 3DCNN and Transformer. Our evaluation on five publicly available datasets demonstrates that VidFormer outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Finally, we discuss the essential roles of each VidFormer module and examine the effects of ethnicity, makeup, and exercise on its performance.

> Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.

> Spread of fake news using out-of-context images and captions has become widespread in this era of information overload. Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

> Noisy labels are both inevitable and problematic in machine learning methods, as they negatively impact models' generalization ability by causing overfitting. In the context of learning with noise, the transition matrix plays a crucial role in the design of statistically consistent algorithms. However, the transition matrix is often considered unidentifiable. One strand of methods typically addresses this problem by assuming that the transition matrix is instance-independent; that is, the probability of mislabeling a particular instance is not influenced by its characteristics or attributes. This assumption is clearly invalid in complex real-world scenarios. To better understand the transition relationship and relax this assumption, we propose to study the data generation process of noisy labels from a causal perspective. We discover that an unobservable latent variable can affect either the instance itself, the label annotation procedure, or both, which complicates the identification of the transition matrix. To address various scenarios, we have unified these observations within a new causal graph. In this graph, the input instance is divided into a noise-resistant component and a noise-sensitive component based on whether they are affected by the latent variable. These two components contribute to identifying the ``causal transition matrix'', which approximates the true transition matrix with theoretical guarantee. In line with this, we have designed a novel training framework that explicitly models this causal relationship and, as a result, achieves a more accurate model for inferring the clean label.

> The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical as these models become increasingly integrated into various societal and decision-making processes. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), achieve alignment by fine-tuning model parameters, but these approaches are often computationally expensive and impractical when models are frozen or inaccessible for parameter modification. In contrast, prompt optimization is a viable alternative to RLHF for LLM alignment. While the existing literature has shown empirical promise of prompt optimization, its theoretical underpinning remains under-explored. We address this gap by formulating prompt optimization as an optimization problem and try to provide theoretical insights into the optimality of such a framework. To analyze the performance of the prompt optimization, we study theoretical suboptimality bounds and provide insights in terms of how prompt optimization depends upon the given prompter and target model. We also provide empirical validation through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that prompt optimization can effectively align LLMs, even when parameter fine-tuning is not feasible.

> Domain adaptation is an active area of research driven by the growing demand for robust machine learning models that perform well on real-world data. Adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to improving generalization ability, particularly for image classification. In this paper, we implement a specific adversarial learning technique known as Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) and replicate digit classification experiments from the original ADDA paper. We extend their findings by examining a broader range of domain shifts and provide a detailed analysis of in-domain classification accuracy post-ADDA. Our results demonstrate that ADDA significantly improves accuracy across certain domain shifts with minimal impact on in-domain performance. Furthermore, we provide qualitative analysis and propose potential explanations for ADDA's limitations in less successful domain shifts. Code is at https://github.com/eugenechoi2004/COS429_FINAL .

> The pervasiveness of proprietary language models has raised critical privacy concerns, necessitating advancements in private inference (PI), where computations are performed directly on encrypted data without revealing users' sensitive information. While PI offers a promising solution, its practical deployment is hindered by substantial communication and latency overheads, primarily stemming from nonlinear operations. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to characterize the role of nonlinearities in decoder-only language models, laying a principled foundation for optimizing transformer-architectures tailored to the demands of PI.   By leveraging Shannon's entropy as a quantitative measure, we uncover the previously unexplored dual significance of nonlinearities: beyond ensuring training stability, they are crucial for maintaining attention head diversity. Specifically, we find that their removal triggers two critical failure modes: {\em entropy collapse} in deeper layers that destabilizes training, and {\em entropic overload} in earlier layers that leads to under-utilization of Multi-Head Attention's (MHA) representational capacity.   We propose an entropy-guided attention mechanism paired with a novel entropy regularization technique to mitigate entropic overload. Additionally, we explore PI-friendly alternatives to layer normalization for preventing entropy collapse and stabilizing the training of LLMs with reduced-nonlinearities. Our study bridges the gap between information theory and architectural design, establishing entropy dynamics as a principled guide for developing efficient PI architectures.

> Traditional regression and prediction tasks often only provide deterministic point estimates. To estimate the distribution or uncertainty of the response variable, traditional methods either assume that the posterior distribution of samples follows a Gaussian process or require thousands of forward passes for sample generation. We propose a novel approach called DistPred for regression and forecasting tasks, which overcomes the limitations of existing methods while remaining simple and powerful. Specifically, we transform proper scoring rules that measure the discrepancy between the predicted distribution and the target distribution into a differentiable discrete form and use it as a loss function to train the model end-to-end. This allows the model to sample numerous samples in a single forward pass to estimate the potential distribution of the response variable. We have compared our method with several existing approaches on multiple datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, our method significantly improves computational efficiency. For example, compared to state-of-the-art models, DistPred has a 180x faster inference speed Experimental results can be reproduced through https://github.com/Anoise/DistPred.

> Traffic forecasting is a fundamental task in transportation research, however the scope of current research has mainly focused on a single data modality of loop detectors. Recently, the advances in Artificial Intelligence and drone technologies have made possible novel solutions for efficient, accurate and flexible aerial observations of urban traffic. As a promising traffic monitoring approach, drone-captured data can create an accurate multi-sensor mobility observatory for large-scale urban networks, when combined with existing infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigates the problem of multi-source traffic speed prediction, simultaneously using drone and loop detector data. A simple yet effective graph-based model HiMSNet is proposed to integrate multiple data modalities and learn spatio-temporal correlations. Detailed analysis shows that predicting accurate segment-level speed is more challenging than the regional speed, especially under high-demand scenarios with heavier congestions and varying traffic dynamics. Utilizing both drone and loop detector data, the prediction accuracy can be improved compared to single-modality cases, when the sensors have lower coverages and are subject to noise. Our simulation study based on vehicle trajectories in a real urban road network has highlighted the added value of integrating drones in traffic forecasting and monitoring.

> Graph learning is naturally well suited for use in symbolic, object-centric planning due to its ability to exploit relational structures exhibited in planning domains and to take as input planning instances with arbitrary numbers of objects. Numeric planning is an extension of symbolic planning in which states may now also exhibit numeric variables. In this work, we propose data-efficient and interpretable machine learning models for learning to solve numeric planning tasks. This involves constructing a new graph kernel for graphs with both continuous and categorical attributes, as well as new optimisation methods for learning heuristic functions for numeric planning. Experiments show that our graph kernels are vastly more efficient and generalise better than graph neural networks for numeric planning, and also yield competitive coverage performance compared to domain-independent numeric planners.

> Visual prompt, a pair of before-and-after edited images, can convey indescribable imagery transformations and prosper in image editing. However, current visual prompt methods rely on a pretrained text-guided image-to-image generative model that requires a triplet of text, before, and after images for retraining over a text-to-image model. Such crafting triplets and retraining processes limit the scalability and generalization of editing. In this paper, we present a framework based on any single text-to-image model without reliance on the explicit image-to-image model thus enhancing the generalizability and scalability. Specifically, by leveraging the probability-flow ordinary equation, we construct a diffusion bridge to transfer the distribution between before-and-after images under the text guidance. By optimizing the text via the bridge, the framework adaptively textualizes the editing transformation conveyed by visual prompts into text embeddings without other models. Meanwhile, we introduce differential attention control during text optimization, which disentangles the text embedding from the invariance of the before-and-after images and makes it solely capture the delicate transformation and generalize to edit various images. Experiments on real images validate competitive results on the generalization, contextual coherence, and high fidelity for delicate editing with just one image pair as the visual prompt.

> Model merging offers an effective strategy to combine the strengths of multiple finetuned models into a unified model that preserves the specialized capabilities of each. Existing methods merge models in a global manner, performing arithmetic operations across all model parameters. However, such global merging often leads to task interference, degrading the performance of the merged model. In this work, we introduce Localize-and-Stitch, a novel approach that merges models in a localized way. Our algorithm works in two steps: i) Localization: identify tiny ($1\%$ of the total parameters) localized regions in the finetuned models containing essential skills for the downstream tasks, and ii) Stitching: reintegrate only these essential regions back into the pretrained model for task synergy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively locates sparse regions responsible for finetuned performance, and the localized regions could be treated as compact and interpretable representations of the finetuned models (tasks). Empirically, we evaluate our method on various vision and language benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing model merging methods under different data availability scenarios. Beyond strong empirical performance, our algorithm also facilitates model compression and preserves pretrained knowledge, enabling flexible and continual skill composition from multiple finetuned models with minimal storage and computational overhead.

> Our research presents a comprehensive approach to leveraging mobile camera image data for real-time air quality assessment and recommendation. We develop a regression-based Convolutional Neural Network model and tailor it explicitly for air quality prediction by exploiting the inherent relationship between output parameters. As a result, the Mean Squared Error of 0.0077 and 0.0112 obtained for 2 and 5 pollutants respectively outperforms existing models. Furthermore, we aim to verify the common practice of augmenting the original dataset with a view to introducing more variation in the training phase. It is one of our most significant contributions that our experimental results demonstrate minimal accuracy differences between the original and augmented datasets. Finally, a real-time, user-friendly dashboard is implemented which dynamically displays the Air Quality Index and pollutant values derived from captured mobile camera images. Users' health conditions are considered to recommend whether a location is suitable based on current air quality metrics. Overall, this research contributes to verification of data augmentation techniques, CNN-based regression modelling for air quality prediction, and user-centric air quality monitoring through mobile technology. The proposed system offers practical solutions for individuals to make informed environmental health and well-being decisions.

> Self-supervised learning (SSL) has significantly advanced image representation learning, yet efficiency challenges persist, particularly with adversarial training. Many SSL methods require extensive epochs to achieve convergence, a demand further amplified in adversarial settings. To address this inefficiency, we revisit the robust EMP-SSL framework, emphasizing the importance of increasing the number of crops per image to accelerate learning. Unlike traditional contrastive learning, robust EMP-SSL leverages multi-crop sampling, integrates an invariance term and regularization, and reduces training epochs, enhancing time efficiency. Evaluated with both standard linear classifiers and multi-patch embedding aggregation, robust EMP-SSL provides new insights into SSL evaluation strategies.   Our results show that robust crop-based EMP-SSL not only accelerates convergence but also achieves a superior balance between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, outperforming multi-crop embedding aggregation. Additionally, we extend this approach with free adversarial training in Multi-Crop SSL, introducing the Cost-Free Adversarial Multi-Crop Self-Supervised Learning (CF-AMC-SSL) method. CF-AMC-SSL demonstrates the effectiveness of free adversarial training in reducing training time while simultaneously improving clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. These findings underscore the potential of CF-AMC-SSL for practical SSL applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/softsys4ai/CF-AMC-SSL.

> Designing effective prompts is essential to guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses. Automated prompt engineering aims to reduce reliance on manual effort by streamlining the design, refinement, and optimization of natural language prompts. This paper proposes an optimal learning framework for automated prompt engineering, designed to sequentially identify effective prompt features while efficiently allocating a limited evaluation budget. We introduce a feature-based method to express prompts, which significantly broadens the search space. Bayesian regression is employed to utilize correlations among similar prompts, accelerating the learning process. To efficiently explore the large space of prompt features for a high quality prompt, we adopt the forward-looking Knowledge-Gradient (KG) policy for sequential optimal learning. The KG policy is computed efficiently by solving mixed-integer second-order cone optimization problems, making it scalable and capable of accommodating prompts characterized only through constraints. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms a set of benchmark strategies assessed on instruction induction tasks. The results highlight the advantages of using the KG policy for prompt learning given a limited evaluation budget. Our framework provides a solution to deploying automated prompt engineering in a wider range applications where prompt evaluation is costly.

> The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have captivated the attention of both academia and industry, transcending their initial role in dialogue generation. To expand the usage scenarios of LLM, some works enhance the effectiveness and capabilities of the model by introducing more external information, which is called the agent paradigm. Based on this idea, we propose a new method that integrates the agent paradigm into out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task, aiming to improve its robustness and adaptability. Our proposed method, Concept Matching with Agent (CMA), employs neutral prompts as agents to augment the CLIP-based OOD detection process. These agents function as dynamic observers and communication hubs, interacting with both In-distribution (ID) labels and data inputs to form vector triangle relationships. This triangular framework offers a more nuanced approach than the traditional binary relationship, allowing for better separation and identification of ID and OOD inputs. Our extensive experimental results showcase the superior performance of CMA over both zero-shot and training-required methods in a diverse array of real-world scenarios.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison unmasks inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore along with direct-weight aggregation is a more effective approach, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.

> Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but still struggle with non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages. This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving multilingual performance without extensive fine-tuning. We introduce a novel dynamic learning approach that optimizes prompt strategy, embedding model, and LLM per query at runtime. By adapting configurations dynamically, our method achieves significant improvements over static, best and random baselines. It operates efficiently in both offline and online settings, generalizing seamlessly across new languages and datasets. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with state-of-the-art multilingual embeddings, we achieve superior task performance across diverse linguistic contexts. Through systematic investigation and evaluation across 18 diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets we show our approach results in 10-15% improvements in multilingual performance over pre-trained models and 4x gains compared to fine-tuned, language-specific models.

> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in collaborative recommendation through their ability to conduct high-order representation smoothing, effectively capturing structural information within users' interaction patterns. However, existing GNN paradigms face significant challenges in scalability and robustness when handling large-scale, noisy, and real-world datasets. To address these challenges, we present LightGNN, a lightweight and distillation-based GNN pruning framework designed to substantially reduce model complexity while preserving essential collaboration modeling capabilities. Our LightGNN framework introduces a computationally efficient pruning module that adaptively identifies and removes redundant edges and embedding entries for model compression. The framework is guided by a resource-friendly hierarchical knowledge distillation objective, whose intermediate layer augments the observed graph to maintain performance, particularly in high-rate compression scenarios. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate LightGNN's effectiveness, significantly improving both computational efficiency and recommendation accuracy. Notably, LightGNN achieves an 80% reduction in edge count and 90% reduction in embedding entries while maintaining performance comparable to more complex state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of our LightGNN framework is available at the github repository: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightGNN.

> This paper explores the integration of model-based and data-driven approaches within the realm of neural speech and audio coding systems. It highlights the challenges posed by the subjective evaluation processes of speech and audio codecs and discusses the limitations of purely data-driven approaches, which often require inefficiently large architectures to match the performance of model-based methods. The study presents hybrid systems as a viable solution, offering significant improvements to the performance of conventional codecs through meticulously chosen design enhancements. Specifically, it introduces a neural network-based signal enhancer designed to post-process existing codecs' output, along with the autoencoder-based end-to-end models and LPCNet--hybrid systems that combine linear predictive coding (LPC) with neural networks. Furthermore, the paper delves into predictive models operating within custom feature spaces (TF-Codec) or predefined transform domains (MDCTNet) and examines the use of psychoacoustically calibrated loss functions to train end-to-end neural audio codecs. Through these investigations, the paper demonstrates the potential of hybrid systems to advance the field of speech and audio coding by bridging the gap between traditional model-based approaches and modern data-driven techniques.

> Quantum annealing (QA) has attracted research interest as a sampler and combinatorial optimization problem (COP) solver. A recently proposed sampling-based solver for QA significantly reduces the required number of qubits, being capable of large COPs. In relation to this, a trainable sampling-based COP solver has been proposed that optimizes its internal parameters from a dataset by using a deep learning technique called deep unfolding. Although learning the internal parameters accelerates the convergence speed, the sampler in the trainable solver is restricted to using a classical sampler owing to the training cost. In this study, to utilize QA in the trainable solver, we propose classical-quantum transfer learning, where parameters are trained classically, and the trained parameters are used in the solver with QA. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the trainable quantum COP solver using classical-quantum transfer learning improves convergence speed and execution time over the original solver.

> Protecting the copyright of large language models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their resource-intensive training and accompanying carefully designed licenses. However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challenging due to potential parameter alterations. In this study, we introduce HuRef, a human-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base model without interfering with training or exposing model parameters to the public. We first observe that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after the model has converged during pretraining, with negligible perturbations through subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient condition to identify the base model. The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM with an extra term to drive away the model parameters' direction and the model becomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks like dimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it without affecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure, we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant terms that identify an LLM's base model. Due to the potential risk of information leakage, we cannot publish invariant terms directly. Instead, we map them to a Gaussian vector using an encoder, then convert it into a natural image using StyleGAN2, and finally publish the image. In our black-box setting, all fingerprinting steps are internally conducted by the LLMs owners. To ensure the published fingerprints are honestly generated, we introduced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/HuRef.

> In this paper, we propose several methods that incorporate vocal tract length (VTL) warped features for spoken keyword spotting (KWS). The first method, VTL-independent KWS, involves training a single deep neural network (DNN) that utilizes VTL features with various warping factors. During training, a specific VTL feature is randomly selected per epoch, allowing the exploration of VTL variations. During testing, the VTL features with different warping factors of a test utterance are scored against the DNN and combined with equal weight. In the second method scores the conventional features of a test utterance (without VTL warping) against the DNN. The third method, VTL-concatenation KWS, concatenates VTL warped features to form high-dimensional features for KWS. Evaluations carried out on the English Google Command dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods improve the accuracy of KWS.

> Geometry plays a significant role in monocular 3D object detection. It can be used to estimate object depth by using the perspective projection between object's physical size and 2D projection in the image plane, which can introduce mathematical priors into deep models. However, this projection process also introduces error amplification, where the error of the estimated height is amplified and reflected into the projected depth. It leads to unreliable depth inferences and also impairs training stability. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Geometry Uncertainty Propagation Network (GUPNet++) by modeling geometry projection in a probabilistic manner. This ensures depth predictions are well-bounded and associated with a reasonable uncertainty. The significance of introducing such geometric uncertainty is two-fold: (1). It models the uncertainty propagation relationship of the geometry projection during training, improving the stability and efficiency of the end-to-end model learning. (2). It can be derived to a highly reliable confidence to indicate the quality of the 3D detection result, enabling more reliable detection inference. Experiments show that the proposed approach not only obtains (state-of-the-art) SOTA performance in image-based monocular 3D detection but also demonstrates superiority in efficacy with a simplified framework.

> Large language models (LLMs) are expected to follow instructions from users and engage in conversations. Techniques to enhance LLMs' instruction-following capabilities typically fine-tune them using data structured according to a predefined chat template. Although chat templates are shown to be effective in optimizing LLM performance, their impact on safety alignment of LLMs has been less understood, which is crucial for deploying LLMs safely at scale.   In this paper, we investigate how chat templates affect safety alignment of LLMs. We identify a common vulnerability, named ChatBug, that is introduced by chat templates. Our key insight to identify ChatBug is that the chat templates provide a rigid format that need to be followed by LLMs, but not by users. Hence, a malicious user may not necessarily follow the chat template when prompting LLMs. Instead, malicious users could leverage their knowledge of the chat template and accordingly craft their prompts to bypass safety alignments of LLMs. We develop two attacks to exploit the ChatBug vulnerability. We demonstrate that a malicious user can exploit the ChatBug vulnerability of eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and effectively elicit unintended responses from these models. Moreover, we show that ChatBug can be exploited by existing jailbreak attacks to enhance their attack success rates. We investigate potential countermeasures to ChatBug. Our results show that while adversarial training effectively mitigates the ChatBug vulnerability, the victim model incurs significant performance degradation. These results highlight the trade-off between safety alignment and helpfulness. Developing new methods for instruction tuning to balance this trade-off is an open and critical direction for future research

> In coastal river systems, frequent floods, often occurring during major storms or king tides, pose a severe threat to lives and property. However, these floods can be mitigated or even prevented by strategically releasing water before extreme weather events with hydraulic structures such as dams, gates, pumps, and reservoirs. A standard approach used by local water management agencies is the "rule-based" method, which specifies predetermined pre-releases of water based on historical and time-tested human experience, but which tends to result in excess or inadequate water release. The model predictive control (MPC), a physics-based model for prediction, is an alternative approach, albeit involving computationally intensive calculations. In this paper, we propose a Forecast Informed Deep Learning Architecture, FIDLAR, to achieve rapid and optimal flood management with precise water pre-releases. FIDLAR seamlessly integrates two neural network modules: one called the Flood Manager, which is responsible for generating water pre-release schedules, and another called the Flood Evaluator, which assesses these generated schedules. The Evaluator module is pre-trained separately, and its gradient-based feedback is used to train the Manager model, ensuring optimal water pre-releases. We have conducted experiments using FIDLAR with data from a flood-prone coastal area in South Florida, particularly susceptible to frequent storms. Results show that FIDLAR is several orders of magnitude faster than currently used physics-based approaches while outperforming baseline methods with improved water pre-release schedules.

> Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, missing modalities are commonly observed due to limitations in scan time, scan corruption, artifacts, motion, and contrast agent intolerance. Synthesis of missing MRI has been a means to address the limitations of modality insufficiency in clinical practice and research. However, there are still some challenges, such as poor generalization, inaccurate non-linear mapping, and slow processing speeds. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel unified synthesis model, the Frequency-guided and Coarse-to-fine Unified Diffusion Model (FgC2F-UDiff), designed for multiple inputs and outputs. Specifically, the Coarse-to-fine Unified Network (CUN) fully exploits the iterative denoising properties of diffusion models, from global to detail, by dividing the denoising process into two stages, coarse and fine, to enhance the fidelity of synthesized images. Secondly, the Frequency-guided Collaborative Strategy (FCS) harnesses appropriate frequency information as prior knowledge to guide the learning of a unified, highly non-linear mapping. Thirdly, the Specific-acceleration Hybrid Mechanism (SHM) integrates specific mechanisms to accelerate the diffusion model and enhance the feasibility of many-to-many synthesis. Extensive experimental evaluations have demonstrated that our proposed FgC2F-UDiff model achieves superior performance on two datasets, validated through a comprehensive assessment that includes both qualitative observations and quantitative metrics, such as PSNR SSIM, LPIPS, and FID.

Traditional lab automation infrastructure faces challenges adapting to new experiments. To address this, we introduce ORGANA, an assistive robotic system that automates diverse chemistry experiments using decision-making and perception tools. It makes decisions with chemists in the loop to control robots and lab devices. ORGANA interacts with chemists using Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive experiment goals, handle disambiguation, and provide experiment logs. ORGANA plans and executes complex tasks with visual feedback, while supporting scheduling and parallel task execution. We demonstrate ORGANA's capabilities in solubility, pH measurement, recrystallization, and electrochemistry experiments. In electrochemistry, it executes a 19-step plan in parallel to characterize quinone derivatives for flow batteries. Our user study shows ORGANA reduces frustration and physical demand by over 50%, with users saving an average of 80.3% of their time when using it.

> The goal of voice conversion is to transform the speech of a source speaker to sound like that of a reference speaker while preserving the original content. A key challenge is to extract disentangled linguistic content from the source and voice style from the reference. While existing approaches leverage various methods to isolate the two, a generalization still requires further attention, especially for robustness in zero-shot scenarios. In this paper, we achieve successful disentanglement of content and speaker features by tuning self-supervised speech features with adapters. The adapters are trained to dynamically encode nuanced features from rich self-supervised features, and the decoder fuses them to produce speech that accurately resembles the reference with minimal loss of content. Moreover, we leverage a conditional flow matching decoder with cross-attention speaker conditioning to further boost the synthesis quality and efficiency. Subjective and objective evaluations in a zero-shot scenario demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing models in speech quality and similarity to the reference speech.

> We propose to utilize an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) for guiding the text generation process in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Modern large language models (LLMs) are adept at performing various text generation tasks through zero-shot learning, prompted with instructions designed for specific objectives. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to derive linguistic information that can facilitate text generation in end-to-end ASR models. Specifically, we instruct an LLM to correct grammatical errors in an ASR hypothesis and use the LLM-derived representations to refine the output further. The proposed model is built on the joint CTC and attention architecture, with the LLM serving as a front-end feature extractor for the decoder. The ASR hypothesis, subject to correction, is obtained from the encoder via CTC decoding and fed into the LLM along with a specific instruction. The decoder subsequently takes as input the LLM output to perform token predictions, combining acoustic information from the encoder and the powerful linguistic information provided by the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed LLM-guided model achieves a relative gain of approximately 13\% in word error rates across major benchmarks.

- *Jijie Zhou, Eryue Xu, Yaoyao Wu, Tianshi Li*

- `2410.11876v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11876v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11876v2)

> The proliferation of LLM-based conversational agents has resulted in excessive disclosure of identifiable or sensitive information. However, existing technologies fail to offer perceptible control or account for users' personal preferences about privacy-utility tradeoffs due to the lack of user involvement. To bridge this gap, we designed, built, and evaluated Rescriber, a browser extension that supports user-led data minimization in LLM-based conversational agents by helping users detect and sanitize personal information in their prompts. Our studies (N=12) showed that Rescriber helped users reduce unnecessary disclosure and addressed their privacy concerns. Users' subjective perceptions of the system powered by Llama3-8B were on par with that by GPT-4o. The comprehensiveness and consistency of the detection and sanitization emerge as essential factors that affect users' trust and perceived protection. Our findings confirm the viability of smaller-LLM-powered, user-facing, on-device privacy controls, presenting a promising approach to address the privacy and trust challenges of AI.

> Tabular data remains one of the most prevalent data types across a wide range of real-world applications, yet effective representation learning for this domain poses unique challenges due to its irregular patterns, heterogeneous feature distributions, and complex inter-column dependencies. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques in tabular data representation learning, structured around three foundational design elements: training data, neural architectures, and learning objectives. Unlike prior surveys that focus primarily on either architecture design or learning strategies, we adopt a holistic perspective that emphasizes the universality and robustness of representation learning methods across diverse downstream tasks. We examine recent advances in data augmentation and generation, specialized neural network architectures tailored to tabular data, and innovative learning objectives that enhance representation quality. Additionally, we highlight the growing influence of self-supervised learning and the adaptation of transformer-based foundation models for tabular data. Our review is based on a systematic literature search using rigorous inclusion criteria, encompassing 127 papers published since 2020 in top-tier conferences and journals. Through detailed analysis and comparison, we identify emerging trends, critical gaps, and promising directions for future research, aiming to guide the development of more generalizable and effective tabular data representation methods.

- *Chenyang Song, Xu Han, Zhengyan Zhang, Shengding Hu, Xiyu Shi, Kuai Li, Chen Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Guangli Li, Tao Yang, Maosong Sun*

- `2402.13516v7` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13516v7) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13516v7)

> Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.

> As large-scale AI models expand, training becomes costlier and sustaining progress grows harder. Classical scaling laws (e.g., Kaplan et al. (2020), Hoffmann et al. (2022)) predict training loss from a static compute budget yet neglect time and efficiency, prompting the question: how can we balance ballooning GPU fleets with rapidly improving hardware and algorithms? We introduce the relative-loss equation, a time- and efficiency-aware framework that extends classical AI scaling laws. Our model shows that, without ongoing efficiency gains, advanced performance could demand millennia of training or unrealistically large GPU fleets. However, near-exponential progress remains achievable if the "efficiency-doubling rate" parallels Moore's Law. By formalizing this race to efficiency, we offer a quantitative roadmap for balancing front-loaded GPU investments with incremental improvements across the AI stack. Empirical trends suggest that sustained efficiency gains can push AI scaling well into the coming decade, providing a new perspective on the diminishing returns inherent in classical scaling.

> Large language models(LLMs) are currently at the forefront of the machine learning field, which show a broad application prospect but at the same time expose some risks of privacy leakage. We combined Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) and provable security theory with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) to propose an efficient and secure inference scheme for LLMs. More specially, we focus on pre-trained LLMs which rely on open-sourced base model and then fine-tuned with the private datasets by LoRA. This is a popular road-map for Vertical Domain Models such as LawGPT and BenTsao. We use two key technologies below. Firstly, we divide the whole model into the public part and the private part. The weights of public part are publicly accessible(e.g. the open-sourced base model) while the private part needs to be protected(e.g. the LoRA matrices). In this way, the overhead brought by computing on private data can be greatly reduced. Secondly, we propose a general method to transform a linear layer into another one which provides security against model extraction attacks and preserves its original functionality, which denoted as Private Linear Layer(PLL). Then we use this method on the LoRA matrices to make sure that the server protects their private weights without restricting the user's input. We also show that the difficulty of performing model extraction attacks for PLL can be reduced to the well-known hard problem Learning with Errors(LWE). Combing this method with FHE, we can protect user's input at the same time. In this paper, we use the open-source model ChatGLM2-6B as the base model which is fine-tuned by LoRA. Experimental results show the inference efficiency of our scheme reaches 1.61s/token which displays that the scheme has good practicality.

> The introduction of large language models has significantly advanced code generation. However, open-source models often lack the execution capabilities and iterative refinement of advanced systems like the GPT-4 Code Interpreter. To address this, we introduce OpenCodeInterpreter, a family of open-source code systems designed for generating, executing, and iteratively refining code. Supported by Code-Feedback, a dataset featuring 68K multi-turn interactions, OpenCodeInterpreter integrates execution and human feedback for dynamic code refinement. Our comprehensive evaluation of OpenCodeInterpreter across key benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and their enhanced versions from EvalPlus reveals its exceptional performance. Notably, OpenCodeInterpreter-33B achieves an accuracy of 83.2 (76.4) on the average (and plus versions) of HumanEval and MBPP, closely rivaling GPT-4's 84.2 (76.2) and further elevates to 91.6 (84.6) with synthesized human feedback from GPT-4. OpenCodeInterpreter brings the gap between open-source code generation models and proprietary systems like GPT-4 Code Interpreter.

- `2501.03544v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03544v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03544v1)

> Text-to-image (T2I) models have been shown to be vulnerable to misuse, particularly in generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 7.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.

> This paper presents ICAT, an evaluation framework for measuring coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the qualitative aspects of long-form responses produced by LLMs.

> Open source is a driving force behind scientific advancement.However, this openness is also a double-edged sword, with the inherent risk that innovative technologies can be misused for purposes harmful to society. What is the likelihood that an open source AI model or dataset will be used to commit a real-world crime, and if a criminal does exploit it, will the people behind the technology be able to escape legal liability? To address these questions, we explore a legal domain where individual choices can have a significant impact on society. Specifically, we build the EVE-V1 dataset that comprises 200 question-answer pairs related to criminal offenses based on 200 Korean precedents first to explore the possibility of malicious models emerging. We further developed EVE-V2 using 600 fraud-related precedents to confirm the existence of malicious models that can provide harmful advice on a wide range of criminal topics to test the domain generalization ability. Remarkably, widely used open-source large-scale language models (LLMs) provide unethical and detailed information about criminal activities when fine-tuned with EVE. We also take an in-depth look at the legal issues that malicious language models and their builders could realistically face. Our findings highlight the paradoxical dilemma that open source accelerates scientific progress, but requires great care to minimize the potential for misuse. Warning: This paper contains content that some may find unethical.

> Transformers have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance on compositional problems remains a topic of debate. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms of how transformers behave on unseen compositional tasks. We discover that the parameter initialization scale plays a critical role in determining whether the model learns inferential (reasoning-based) solutions, which capture the underlying compositional primitives, or symmetric (memory-based) solutions, which simply memorize mappings without understanding the compositional structure. By analyzing the information flow and vector representations within the model, we reveal the distinct mechanisms underlying these solution types. We further find that inferential (reasoning-based) solutions exhibit low complexity bias, which we hypothesize is a key factor enabling them to learn individual mappings for single anchors. We validate our conclusions on various real-world datasets. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of initialization scale in tuning the reasoning and memorizing ability and we propose the initialization rate $\gamma$ to be a convenient tunable hyper-parameter in common deep learning frameworks, where $1/d_{\mathrm{in}}^\gamma$ is the standard deviation of parameters of the layer with $d_{\mathrm{in}}$ input neurons.

> Outlier detection (OD) is the task of identifying unusual observations (or outliers) from a given or upcoming data by learning unique patterns of normal observations (or inliers). Recently, a study introduced a powerful unsupervised OD (UOD) solver based on a new observation of deep generative models, called inlier-memorization (IM) effect, which suggests that generative models memorize inliers before outliers in early learning stages. In this study, we aim to develop a theoretically principled method to address UOD tasks by maximally utilizing the IM effect. We begin by observing that the IM effect is observed more clearly when the given training data contain fewer outliers. This finding indicates a potential for enhancing the IM effect in UOD regimes if we can effectively exclude outliers from mini-batches when designing the loss function. To this end, we introduce two main techniques: 1) increasing the mini-batch size as the model training proceeds and 2) using an adaptive threshold to calculate the truncated loss function. We theoretically show that these two techniques effectively filter out outliers from the truncated loss function, allowing us to utilize the IM effect to the fullest. Coupled with an additional ensemble strategy, we propose our method and term it Adaptive Loss Truncation with Batch Increment (ALTBI). We provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate that ALTBI achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying outliers compared to other recent methods, even with significantly lower computation costs. Additionally, we show that our method yields robust performances when combined with privacy-preserving algorithms.

> Multilingual knowledge graphs (KGs) provide high-quality relational and textual information for various NLP applications, but they are often incomplete, especially in non-English languages. Previous research has shown that combining information from KGs in different languages aids either Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), the task of predicting missing relations between entities, or Knowledge Graph Enhancement (KGE), the task of predicting missing textual information for entities. Although previous efforts have considered KGC and KGE as independent tasks, we hypothesize that they are interdependent and mutually beneficial. To this end, we introduce KG-TRICK, a novel sequence-to-sequence framework that unifies the tasks of textual and relational information completion for multilingual KGs. KG-TRICK demonstrates that: i) it is possible to unify the tasks of KGC and KGE into a single framework, and ii) combining textual information from multiple languages is beneficial to improve the completeness of a KG. As part of our contributions, we also introduce WikiKGE10++, the largest manually-curated benchmark for textual information completion of KGs, which features over 25,000 entities across 10 diverse languages.

> Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) suffers from uncertainties and inaccuracies in the observation signal in realworld applications. Adversarial attack is an effective method for evaluating the robustness of DRL agents. However, existing attack methods targeting individual sampled actions have limited impacts on the overall policy distribution, particularly in continuous action spaces. To address these limitations, we propose the Distribution-Aware Projected Gradient Descent attack (DAPGD). DAPGD uses distribution similarity as the gradient perturbation input to attack the policy network, which leverages the entire policy distribution rather than relying on individual samples. We utilize the Bhattacharyya distance in DAPGD to measure policy similarity, enabling sensitive detection of subtle but critical differences between probability distributions. Our experiment results demonstrate that DAPGD achieves SOTA results compared to the baselines in three robot navigation tasks, achieving an average 22.03% higher reward drop compared to the best baseline.

> We introduce Bongard-OpenWorld, a new benchmark for evaluating real-world few-shot reasoning for machine vision. It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities.

> Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called CausalMob, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

In this paper we employ a knowledge graph-based approach for enterprise modeling and investigate the potential benefits of LLMs in this context. In addition, the findings of an expert survey and ChatGPT-4o-based experiments demonstrate that LLM-based model generations exhibit minimal variability, yet remain constrained to specific tasks, with reliability declining for more intricate tasks. The survey results further suggest that the supervision and intervention of human modeling experts are essential to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the generated models.

> Recent years have witnessed a thriving growth of computing facilities connected at the network edge, cultivating edge networks as a fundamental infrastructure for supporting miscellaneous intelligent services.Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) frontiers have extrapolated to the graph domain and promoted Graph Intelligence (GI). Given the inherent relation between graphs and networks, the interdiscipline of graph learning and edge networks, i.e., Edge GI or EGI, has revealed a novel interplay between them -- GI aids in optimizing edge networks, while edge networks facilitate GI model deployment. Driven by this delicate closed-loop, EGI is recognized as a promising solution to fully unleash the potential of edge computing power and is garnering growing attention. Nevertheless, research on EGI remains nascent, and there is a soaring demand within both the communications and AI communities for a dedicated venue to share recent advancements. To this end, this paper promotes the concept of EGI, explores its scope and core principles, and conducts a comprehensive survey concerning recent research efforts on this emerging field. Specifically, this paper introduces and discusses: 1) fundamentals of edge computing and graph learning,2) emerging techniques centering on the closed loop between graph intelligence and edge networks, and 3) open challenges and research opportunities of future EGI. By bridging the gap across communication, networking, and graph learning areas, we believe that this survey can garner increased attention, foster meaningful discussions, and inspire further research ideas in EGI.

An important type is the two-sample test, which evaluates whether two sets of data points are from identical distributions. This test is widely used, such as by clinical researchers comparing treatment effectiveness. This tutorial explores two-sample testing in a context where an analyst has many features from two samples, but determining the sample membership (or labels) of these features is costly. In machine learning, a similar scenario is studied in active learning. This tutorial extends active learning concepts to two-sample testing within this \textit{label-costly} setting while maintaining statistical validity and high testing power. Additionally, the tutorial discusses practical applications of these label-efficient two-sample tests.

> Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly gained popularity and are being embedded into professional applications due to their capabilities in generating human-like content. However, unquestioned reliance on their outputs and recommendations can be problematic as LLMs can reinforce societal biases and stereotypes. This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs. We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles. Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role. Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations. Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances. These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field. As LLMs are increasingly adopted within SE research and professional practices, awareness of these biases is crucial to prevent the reinforcement of discriminatory norms and to ensure that AI tools are leveraged to promote an inclusive and equitable engineering culture rather than hinder it.

> The Fisher-Rao distance between two probability distributions of a statistical model is defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information metric. In order to calculate the Fisher-Rao distance in closed-form, we need (1) to elicit a formula for the Fisher-Rao geodesics, and (2) to integrate the Fisher length element along those geodesics. We consider several numerically robust approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances: First, we report generic upper bounds on Fisher-Rao distances based on closed-form 1D Fisher-Rao distances of submodels. Second, we describe several generic approximation schemes depending on whether the Fisher-Rao geodesics or pregeodesics are available in closed-form or not. In particular, we obtain a generic method to guarantee an arbitrarily small additive error on the approximation provided that Fisher-Rao pregeodesics and tight lower and upper bounds are available. Third, we consider the case of Fisher metrics being Hessian metrics, and report generic tight upper bounds on the Fisher-Rao distances using techniques of information geometry. Uniparametric and biparametric statistical models always have Fisher Hessian metrics, and in general a simple test allows to check whether the Fisher information matrix yields a Hessian metric or not. Fourth, we consider elliptical distribution families and show how to apply the above techniques to these models. We also propose two new distances based either on the Fisher-Rao lengths of curves serving as proxies of Fisher-Rao geodesics, or based on the Birkhoff/Hilbert projective cone distance. Last, we consider an alternative group-theoretic approach for statistical transformation models based on the notion of maximal invariant which yields insights on the structures of the Fisher-Rao distance formula which may be used fruitfully in applications.

> Due to the increasing abuse of fraudulent activities that result in significant financial and reputational harm, Ethereum smart contracts face a significant problem in detecting fraud. Existing monitoring methods typically rely on lease code analysis or physically extracted features, which suffer from scalability and adaptability limitations. In this study, we use graph representation learning to observe purchase trends and find fraudulent deals. We can achieve powerful categorisation performance by using innovative machine learning versions and transforming Ethereum invoice data into graph structures. Our method addresses label imbalance through SMOTE-ENN techniques and evaluates models like Multi-Layer Perceptron ( MLP ) and Graph Convolutional Networks ( GCN). Experimental results show that the MLP type surpasses the GCN in this environment, with domain-specific assessments closely aligned with real-world assessments. This study provides a scalable and efficient way to improve Ethereum's ecosystem's confidence and security.

> Auditory attention decoding from electroencephalogram (EEG) could infer to which source the user is attending in noisy environments. Decoding algorithms and experimental paradigm designs are crucial for the development of technology in practical applications. To simulate real-world scenarios, this study proposed a cue-masked auditory attention paradigm to avoid information leakage before the experiment. To obtain high decoding accuracy with low latency, an end-to-end deep learning model, AADNet, was proposed to exploit the spatiotemporal information from the short time window of EEG signals. The results showed that with a 0.5-second EEG window, AADNet achieved an average accuracy of 93.46% and 91.09% in decoding auditory orientation attention (OA) and timbre attention (TA), respectively. It significantly outperformed five previous methods and did not need the knowledge of the original audio source. This work demonstrated that it was possible to detect the orientation and timbre of auditory attention from EEG signals fast and accurately. The results are promising for the real-time multi-property auditory attention decoding, facilitating the application of the neuro-steered hearing aids and other assistive listening devices.

> Web accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can access and interact with digital content without barriers, yet a significant majority of most used websites fail to meet accessibility standards. This study evaluates ChatGPT's (GPT-4o) ability to generate and improve web pages in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). While ChatGPT can effectively address accessibility issues when prompted, its default code often lacks compliance, reflecting limitations in its training data and prevailing inaccessible web practices. Automated and manual testing revealed strengths in resolving simple issues but challenges with complex tasks, requiring human oversight and additional iterations. Unlike prior studies, we incorporate manual evaluation, dynamic elements, and use the visual reasoning capability of ChatGPT along with the prompts to fix accessibility issues. Providing screenshots alongside prompts enhances the LLM's ability to address accessibility issues by allowing it to analyze surrounding components, such as determining appropriate contrast colors. We found that effective prompt engineering, such as providing concise, structured feedback and incorporating visual aids, significantly enhances ChatGPT's performance. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of large language models for accessible web development, offering practical guidance for developers to create more inclusive websites.

> The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raises the question of how they compare to human performance. While existing datasets often feature synthetic or overly simplistic tasks, some models have already surpassed human expert baselines. In this paper, we present MULTI, a Chinese multimodal dataset derived from authentic examination questions. Comprising over 18,000 carefully selected and refined questions, MULTI evaluates models using real-world examination standards, encompassing image-text comprehension, complex reasoning, and knowledge recall. Additionally, We also introduce MULTI-Elite, a 500-question selected hard subset, and MULTI-Extend with more than 4,500 external knowledge context pieces for testing in-context learning capabilities. Our evaluation highlights substantial room for MLLM advancement, with Qwen2-VL-72B achieving a 76.9% accuracy on MULTI and 53.1% on MULTI-Elite leading 25 evaluated models, compared to human expert baselines of 86.1% and 73.1%.

> Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.

> In smart cities, context-aware spatio-temporal crowd flow prediction (STCFP) models leverage contextual features (e.g., weather) to identify unusual crowd mobility patterns and enhance prediction accuracy. However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research. The STContext is open-sourced at https://github.com/Liyue-Chen/STContext.

> Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in short text clustering, yet it has an inherent drawback of mistakenly identifying samples from the same category as negatives and then separating them in the feature space (false negative separation), which hinders the generation of superior representations. To generate more discriminative representations for efficient clustering, we propose a novel short text clustering method, called Discriminative Representation learning via \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning for Short Text Clustering (\textbf{AECL}). The \textbf{AECL} consists of two modules which are the pseudo-label generation module and the contrastive learning module. Both modules build a sample-level attention mechanism to capture similarity relationships between samples and aggregate cross-sample features to generate consistent representations. Then, the former module uses the more discriminative consistent representation to produce reliable supervision information for assist clustering, while the latter module explores similarity relationships and consistent representations optimize the construction of positive samples to perform similarity-guided contrastive learning, effectively addressing the false negative separation issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \textbf{AECL} outperforms state-of-the-art methods. If the paper is accepted, we will open-source the code.

> Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.   The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.   The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.   After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.   In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.

> Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain, has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the neural network model, in combination with its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in digital computers is intrinsically energy hungry, with energy consumption becoming prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing system. The learning process in these material systems, realized, e.g., by artificial evolution, equilibrium propagation or surrogate modelling, is a complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet efficient and accurate gradient extraction method, based on the principle of homodyne detection, for performing gradient descent on a loss function directly in a physical system without the need of an analytical description. By perturbing the parameters that need to be optimized using sinusoidal waveforms with distinct frequencies, we effectively obtain the gradient information in a highly robust and scalable manner. We illustrate the method in dopant network processing units, but argue that it is applicable in a wide range of physical systems. Homodyne gradient extraction can in principle be fully implemented in materia, facilitating the development of autonomously learning material systems.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in their reservoir of knowledge and understanding capabilities, but they have also been shown to be prone to illegal or unethical reactions when subjected to jailbreak attacks. To ensure their responsible deployment in critical applications, it is crucial to understand the safety capabilities and vulnerabilities of LLMs. Previous works mainly focus on jailbreak in single-round dialogue, overlooking the potential jailbreak risks in multi-round dialogues, which are a vital way humans interact with and extract information from LLMs. Some studies have increasingly concentrated on the risks associated with jailbreak in multi-round dialogues. These efforts typically involve the use of manually crafted templates or prompt engineering techniques. However, due to the inherent complexity of multi-round dialogues, their jailbreak performance is limited. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-round dialogue jailbreaking agent, emphasizing the importance of stealthiness in identifying and mitigating potential threats to human values posed by LLMs. We propose a risk decomposition strategy that distributes risks across multiple rounds of queries and utilizes psychological strategies to enhance attack strength. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method surpasses other attack methods and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate. We will make the corresponding code and dataset available for future research. The code will be released soon.

> Transformers have achieved remarkable success in tabular data generation. However, they lack domain-specific inductive biases which are critical to preserving the intrinsic characteristics of tabular data. Meanwhile, they suffer from poor scalability and efficiency due to quadratic computational complexity. In this paper, we propose TabTreeFormer, a hybrid transformer architecture that incorporates a tree-based model that retains tabular-specific inductive biases of non-smooth and potentially low-correlated patterns caused by discreteness and non-rotational invariance, and hence enhances the fidelity and utility of synthetic data. In addition, we devise a dual-quantization tokenizer to capture the multimodal continuous distribution and further facilitate the learning of numerical value distribution. Moreover, our proposed tokenizer reduces the vocabulary size and sequence length due to the limited complexity (e.g., dimension-wise semantic meaning) of tabular data, rendering a significant model size shrink without sacrificing the capability of the transformer model. We evaluate TabTreeFormer on 10 datasets against multiple generative models on various metrics; our experimental results show that TabTreeFormer achieves superior fidelity, utility, privacy, and efficiency. Our best model yields a 40% utility improvement with 1/16 of the baseline model size.

> Urban segregation refers to the physical and social division of people, often driving inequalities within cities and exacerbating socioeconomic and racial tensions. While most studies focus on residential spaces, they often neglect segregation across "activity spaces" where people work, socialize, and engage in leisure. Human mobility data offers new opportunities to analyze broader segregation patterns, encompassing both residential and activity spaces, but challenges existing methods in capturing the complexity and local nuances of urban segregation. This work introduces InclusiViz, a novel visual analytics system for multi-level analysis of urban segregation, facilitating the development of targeted, data-driven interventions. Specifically, we developed a deep learning model to predict mobility patterns across social groups using environmental features, augmented with explainable AI to reveal how these features influence segregation. The system integrates innovative visualizations that allow users to explore segregation patterns from broad overviews to fine-grained detail and evaluate urban planning interventions with real-time feedback. We conducted a quantitative evaluation to validate the model's accuracy and efficiency. Two case studies and expert interviews with social scientists and urban analysts demonstrated the system's effectiveness, highlighting its potential to guide urban planning toward more inclusive cities.

> Phishing attacks are a major threat to online security, exploiting user vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information. Various methods have been developed to counteract phishing, each with varying levels of accuracy, but they also face notable limitations. In this study, we introduce PhishAgent, a multimodal agent that combines a wide range of tools, integrating both online and offline knowledge bases with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This combination leads to broader brand coverage, which enhances brand recognition and recall. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal information retrieval framework designed to extract the relevant top k items from offline knowledge bases, using available information from a webpage, including logos and HTML. Our empirical results, based on three real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces both false positives and false negatives, while maintaining model efficiency. Additionally, PhishAgent shows strong resilience against various types of adversarial attacks.

> We consider an operator-based latent Markov representation of a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system, where the stochastic evolution of the latent state embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is described with the corresponding transfer operator, and develop a spectral method to learn this representation based on the theory of stochastic realization. The embedding may be learned simultaneously using reproducing kernels, for example, constructed with feed-forward neural networks. We also address the generalization of sequential state-estimation (Kalman filtering) in stochastic nonlinear systems, and of operator-based eigen-mode decomposition of dynamics, for the representation. Several examples with synthetic and real-world data are shown to illustrate the empirical characteristics of our methods, and to investigate the performance of our model in sequential state-estimation and mode decomposition.

> Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.

> Quality factors like passive voice or sentence length are commonly used in research and practice to evaluate the quality of natural language requirements since they indicate defects in requirements artifacts that potentially propagate to later stages in the development life cycle. However, as a research community, we still lack a holistic perspective on quality factors. This inhibits not only a comprehensive understanding of the existing body of knowledge but also the effective use and evolution of these factors. To this end, we propose an ontology of quality factors for textual requirements, which includes (1) a structure framing quality factors and related elements and (2) a central repository and web interface making these factors publicly accessible and usable. We contribute the first version of both by applying a rigorous ontology development method to 105 eligible primary studies and construct a first version of the repository and interface. We illustrate the usability of the ontology and invite fellow researchers to a joint community effort to complete and maintain this knowledge repository. We envision our ontology to reflect the community's harmonized perception of requirements quality factors, guide reporting of new quality factors, and provide central access to the current body of knowledge.

> Requirements engineering aims to fulfill a purpose, i.e., inform subsequent software development activities about stakeholders' needs and constraints that must be met by the system under development. The quality of requirements artifacts and processes is determined by how fit for this purpose they are, i.e., how they impact activities affected by them. However, research on requirements quality lacks a comprehensive overview of these activities and how to measure them. In this paper, we specify the research endeavor addressing this gap and propose an initial model of requirements-affected activities and their attributes. We construct a model from three distinct data sources, including both literature and empirical data. The results yield an initial model containing 24 activities and 16 attributes quantifying these activities. Our long-term goal is to develop evidence-based decision support on how to optimize the fitness for purpose of the RE phase to best support the subsequent, affected software development process. We do so by measuring the effect that requirements artifacts and processes have on the attributes of these activities. With the contribution at hand, we invite the research community to critically discuss our research roadmap and support the further evolution of the model.

> Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their sophisticated and stealthy nature. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fall short in detecting these multi-stage attacks. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been employed to enhance IDS capabilities by analyzing the complex relationships within networked data. However, existing GNN-based solutions are hampered by high false positive rates and substantial resource consumption. In this paper, we present a novel IDS designed to detect APTs using a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Autoencoder. Our approach leverages spatial information to understand the interactions between entities within a graph and temporal information to capture the evolution of the graph over time. This dual perspective is crucial for identifying the sequential stages of APTs. Furthermore, to address privacy and scalability concerns, we deploy our architecture in a federated learning environment. This setup ensures that local data remains on-premise while encrypted model-weights are shared and aggregated using homomorphic encryption, maintaining data privacy and security. Our evaluation shows that this system effectively detects APTs with lower false positive rates and optimized resource usage compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of spatio-temporal analysis and federated learning in enhancing cybersecurity defenses.

- *Xuyang Zhong, Chen Liu*

> Dataset distillation methods have demonstrated remarkable performance for neural networks trained with very limited training data. However, a significant challenge arises in the form of \textit{architecture overfitting}: the distilled training dataset synthesized by a specific network architecture (i.e., training network) generates poor performance when trained by other network architectures (i.e., test networks), especially when the test networks have a larger capacity than the training network. This paper introduces a series of approaches to mitigate this issue. Among them, DropPath renders the large model to be an implicit ensemble of its sub-networks, and knowledge distillation ensures each sub-network acts similarly to the small but well-performing teacher network. These methods, characterized by their smoothing effects, significantly mitigate architecture overfitting. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our methods. Particularly, across various scenarios involving different tasks and different sizes of distilled data, our approaches significantly mitigate architecture overfitting. Furthermore, our approaches achieve comparable or even superior performance when the test network is larger than the training network.

> This study introduces LlaMADRS, a novel framework leveraging open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate depression severity assessment using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We employ a zero-shot prompting strategy with carefully designed cues to guide the model in interpreting and scoring transcribed clinical interviews. Our approach, tested on 236 real-world interviews from the Context-Adaptive Multimodal Informatics (CAMI) dataset, demonstrates strong correlations with clinician assessments. The Qwen 2.5--72b model achieves near-human level agreement across most MADRS items, with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) closely approaching those between human raters. We provide a comprehensive analysis of model performance across different MADRS items, highlighting strengths and current limitations. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with appropriate prompting, can serve as efficient tools for mental health assessment, potentially increasing accessibility in resource-limited settings. However, challenges remain, particularly in assessing symptoms that rely on non-verbal cues, underscoring the need for multimodal approaches in future work.

> While adversarial training methods have significantly improved the robustness of deep neural networks against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations, the generalization gap between their performance on training and test data is considerably greater than that of standard empirical risk minimization. Recent studies have aimed to connect the generalization properties of adversarially trained classifiers to the min-max optimization algorithm used in their training. In this work, we analyze the interconnections between generalization and optimization in adversarial training using the algorithmic stability framework. Specifically, our goal is to compare the generalization gap of neural networks trained using the vanilla adversarial training method, which fully optimizes perturbations at every iteration, with the free adversarial training method, which simultaneously optimizes norm-bounded perturbations and classifier parameters. We prove bounds on the generalization error of these methods, indicating that the free adversarial training method may exhibit a lower generalization gap between training and test samples due to its simultaneous min-max optimization of classifier weights and perturbation variables. We conduct several numerical experiments to evaluate the train-to-test generalization gap in vanilla and free adversarial training methods. Our empirical findings also suggest that the free adversarial training method could lead to a smaller generalization gap over a similar number of training iterations.

> We study a class of optimization problems in the Wasserstein space (the space of probability measures) where the objective function is nonconvex along generalized geodesics. Specifically, the objective exhibits some difference-of-convex structure along these geodesics. The setting also encompasses sampling problems where the logarithm of the target distribution is difference-of-convex. We derive multiple convergence insights for a novel semi Forward-Backward Euler scheme under several nonconvex (and possibly nonsmooth) regimes. Notably, the semi Forward-Backward Euler is just a slight modification of the Forward-Backward Euler whose convergence is -- to our knowledge -- still unknown in our very general non-geodesically-convex setting.

> The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to black-box adversarial attacks is one of the most heated topics in trustworthy AI. In such attacks, the attackers operate without any insider knowledge of the model, making the cross-model transferability of adversarial examples critical. Despite the potential for adversarial examples to be effective across various models, it has been observed that adversarial examples that are specifically crafted for a specific model often exhibit poor transferability. In this paper, we explore the transferability of adversarial examples via the lens of Bayesian approach. Specifically, we leverage Bayesian approach to probe the transferability and then study what constitutes a transferability-promoting prior. Following this, we design two concrete transferability-promoting priors, along with an adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for instances sampled from these priors. Employing these techniques, we present BayAtk. Extensive experiments illustrate the significant effectiveness of BayAtk in crafting more transferable adversarial examples against both undefended and defended black-box models compared to existing state-of-the-art attacks.

> Version control systems are commonly used to manage open-source software, in which each commit may introduce new vulnerabilities or fix existing ones. Researchers have developed various tools for detecting vulnerabilities in code commits, but their performance is limited by factors such as neglecting descriptive data and challenges in accurately identifying vulnerability introductions. To overcome these limitations, we propose CommitShield, which combines the code analysis capabilities of static analysis tools with the natural language and code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy of vulnerability introduction and fix detection by generating precise descriptions and obtaining rich patch contexts. We evaluate CommitShield using the newly constructed vulnerability repair dataset, CommitVulFix, and a cleaned vulnerability introduction dataset. Experimental results indicate that CommitShield improves recall by 76%-87% over state-of-the-art methods in the vulnerability fix detection task, and its F1-score improves by 15%-27% in the vulnerability introduction detection task.

> In many applications, both data samples and features have underlying hierarchical structures. However, existing methods for learning these latent structures typically focus on either samples or features, ignoring possible coupling between them. In this paper, we introduce a coupled hierarchical structure learning method using tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD). Our method jointly computes TWDs for samples and features, representing their latent hierarchies as trees. We propose an iterative, unsupervised procedure to build these sample and feature trees based on diffusion geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and wavelet filters. We show that this iterative procedure converges and empirically improves the quality of the constructed trees. The method is also computationally efficient and scales well in high-dimensional settings. Our method can be seamlessly integrated with hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (HGCN). We demonstrate that our method outperforms competing approaches in sparse approximation and unsupervised Wasserstein distance learning on several word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. In addition, integrating our method into HGCN enhances performance in link prediction and node classification tasks.

> Experimentation is an essential method for causal inference in any empirical discipline. Crossover-design experiments are common in Software Engineering (SE) research. In these, subjects apply more than one treatment in different orders. This design increases the amount of obtained data and deals with subject variability but introduces threats to internal validity like the learning and carryover effect. Vegas et al. reviewed the state of practice for crossover designs in SE research and provided guidelines on how to address its threats during data analysis while still harnessing its benefits. In this paper, we reflect on the impact of these guidelines and review the state of analysis of crossover design experiments in SE publications between 2015 and March 2024. To this end, by conducting a forward snowballing of the guidelines, we survey 136 publications reporting 67 crossover-design experiments and evaluate their data analysis against the provided guidelines. The results show that the validity of data analyses has improved compared to the original state of analysis. Still, despite the explicit guidelines, only 29.5% of all threats to validity were addressed properly. While the maturation and the optimal sequence threats are properly addressed in 35.8% and 38.8% of all studies in our sample respectively, the carryover threat is only modeled in about 3% of the observed cases. The lack of adherence to the analysis guidelines threatens the validity of the conclusions drawn from crossover design experiments

> The Langevin Dynamics framework, which aims to generate samples from the score function of a probability distribution, is widely used for analyzing and interpreting score-based generative modeling. While the convergence behavior of Langevin Dynamics under unimodal distributions has been extensively studied in the literature, in practice the data distribution could consist of multiple distinct modes. In this work, we investigate Langevin Dynamics in producing samples from multimodal distributions and theoretically study its mode-seeking properties. We prove that under a variety of sub-Gaussian mixtures, Langevin Dynamics is unlikely to find all mixture components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. To reduce the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin Dynamics, we propose \emph{Chained Langevin Dynamics}, which divides the data vector into patches of constant size and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. We perform a theoretical analysis of Chained Langevin Dynamics by reducing it to sampling from a constant-dimensional distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, supporting our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the chained and vanilla Langevin Dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/Xiwei-Cheng/Chained_LD.

> In recent years, traffic flow prediction has played a crucial role in the management of intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional forecasting methods often model non-Euclidean low-dimensional traffic data as a simple graph with single-type nodes and edges, failing to capture similar trends among nodes of the same type. To address this limitation, this paper proposes MHGNet, a novel framework for modeling spatiotemporal multi-heterogeneous graphs. Within this framework, the STD Module decouples single-pattern traffic data into multi-pattern traffic data through feature mappings of timestamp embedding matrices and node embedding matrices. Subsequently, the Node Clusterer leverages the Euclidean distance between nodes and different types of limit points to perform clustering with O(N) time complexity. The nodes within each cluster undergo residual subgraph convolution within the spatiotemporal fusion subgraphs generated by the DSTGG Module, followed by processing in the SIE Module for node repositioning and redistribution of weights. To validate the effectiveness of MHGNet, this paper conducts extensive ablation studies and quantitative evaluations on four widely used benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.

> It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities. However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities. We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement. We conduct a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects. We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis. Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models. The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models. Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models. Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention. Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality.

> Effective evaluation of multi-hop tool use is critical for analyzing the understanding, reasoning, and function-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches.

> The recent surge in the field of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to bring about transformative changes across a range of sectors, including software engineering and education. As GenAI tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are increasingly utilised in software engineering, it becomes imperative to understand the impact of these technologies on the software product. This study employs a methodological approach, comprising web scraping and data mining from LeetCode, with the objective of comparing the software quality of Python programs produced by LeetCode users with that generated by GPT-4o. In order to gain insight into these matters, this study addresses the question whether GPT-4o produces software of superior quality to that produced by humans.   The findings indicate that GPT-4o does not present a considerable impediment to code quality, understandability, or runtime when generating code on a limited scale. Indeed, the generated code even exhibits significantly lower values across all three metrics in comparison to the user-written code. However, no significantly superior values were observed for the generated code in terms of memory usage in comparison to the user code, which contravened the expectations. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that GPT-4o encountered challenges in generalising to problems that were not included in the training data set.   This contribution presents a first large-scale study comparing generated code with human-written code based on LeetCode platform based on multiple measures including code quality, code understandability, time behaviour and resource utilisation. All data is publicly available for further research.

> README files play an important role in providing installation-related instructions to software users and are widely used in open source software systems on platforms such as GitHub. However, these files often suffer from various documentation issues, leading to challenges in comprehension and potential errors in content. Despite their significance, there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding the documentation efforts invested in README files, especially in the context of installation-related instructions, which are crucial for users to start with a software project. To fill the research gap, we conducted a qualitative study, investigating 400 GitHub repositories with 1,163 README commits that focused on updates in installation-related sections. Our research revealed six major categories of changes in the README commits, namely pre-installation instructions, installation instructions, post-installation instructions, help information updates, document presentation, and external resource management. We further provide detailed insights into modification behaviours and offer examples of these updates. Based on our findings, we propose a README template tailored to cover the installation-related sections for documentation maintainers to reference when updating documents. We further validate this template by conducting an online survey, identifying that documentation readers find the augmented documents based on our template are generally of better quality. We further provide recommendations to practitioners for maintaining their README files, as well as motivations for future research directions... (too long for arxiv)

> This paper presents a novel mixed-precision quantization approach for speech foundation models that tightly integrates mixed-precision learning and quantized model parameter estimation into one single model compression stage. Experiments conducted on LibriSpeech dataset with fine-tuned wav2vec2.0-base and HuBERT-large models suggest the resulting mixed-precision quantized models increased the lossless compression ratio by factors up to 1.7x and 1.9x over the respective uniform-precision and two-stage mixed-precision quantized baselines that perform precision learning and model parameters quantization in separate and disjointed stages, while incurring no statistically word error rate (WER) increase over the 32-bit full-precision models. The system compression time of wav2vec2.0-base and HuBERT-large models is reduced by up to 1.9 and 1.5 times over the two-stage mixed-precision baselines, while both produce lower WERs. The best-performing 3.5-bit mixed-precision quantized HuBERT-large model produces a lossless compression ratio of 8.6x over the 32-bit full-precision system.

> In real-world applications, one often encounters ambiguously labeled data, where different annotators assign conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning allows training classifiers in this weakly supervised setting, where state-of-the-art methods already show good predictive performance. However, even the best algorithms give incorrect predictions, which can have severe consequences when they impact actions or decisions. We propose a novel risk-consistent nearest-neighbor-based partial-label learning algorithm with a reject option, that is, the algorithm can reject unsure predictions. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that our method provides the best trade-off between the number and accuracy of non-rejected predictions when compared to our competitors, which use confidence thresholds for rejecting unsure predictions. When evaluated without the reject option, our nearest-neighbor-based approach also achieves competitive prediction performance.

> The last five years of research on distributed graph algorithms have seen huge leaps of progress, both regarding algorithmic improvements and impossibility results: new strong lower bounds have emerged for many central problems and exponential improvements over the state of the art have been achieved for the runtimes of many algorithms. Nevertheless, there are still large gaps between the best known upper and lower bounds for many important problems. The current lower bound techniques for deterministic algorithms are often tailored to obtaining a logarithmic bound and essentially cannot be used to prove lower bounds beyond $\Omega(\log n)$. In contrast, the best deterministic upper bounds are often polylogarithmic, raising the fundamental question of how to resolve the gap between logarithmic lower and polylogarithmic upper bounds and finally obtain tight bounds. We develop a novel algorithm design technique aimed at closing this gap. In essence, each node finds a carefully chosen local solution in $O(\log n)$ rounds and we guarantee that this solution is consistent with the other nodes' solutions without coordination. The local solutions are based on a distributed version of Hall's theorem that may be of independent interest and motivates the title of this work. We showcase our framework by improving on the state of the art for the following fundamental problems: edge coloring, bipartite saturating matchings and hypergraph sinkless orientation. In particular, we obtain an asymptotically optimal $O(\log n)$-round algorithm for $3\Delta/2$-edge coloring in bounded degree graphs. The previously best bound for the problem was $O(\log^4 n)$ rounds, obtained by plugging in the state-of-the-art maximal independent set algorithm from arXiv:2303.16043 into the $3\Delta/2$-edge coloring algorithm from arXiv:1711.05469 .

> Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.

> Deep learning (DL) models have gained prominence in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing but remain underutilized for regression tasks involving tabular data. In these cases, traditional machine learning (ML) models often outperform DL models. In this study, we propose and evaluate various data augmentation (DA) techniques to improve the performance of DL models for tabular data regression tasks. We compare the performance gain of Neural Networks by different DA strategies ranging from a naive method of duplicating existing observations and adding noise to a more sophisticated DA strategy that preserves the underlying statistical relationship in the data. Our analysis demonstrates that the advanced DA method significantly improves DL model performance across multiple datasets and regression tasks, resulting in an average performance increase of over 10\% compared to baseline models without augmentation. The efficacy of these DA strategies was rigorously validated across 30 distinct datasets, with multiple iterations and evaluations using three different automated deep learning (AutoDL) frameworks: AutoKeras, H2O, and AutoGluon. This study demonstrates that by leveraging advanced DA techniques, DL models can realize their full potential in regression tasks, thereby contributing to broader adoption and enhanced performance in practical applications.

In financial contexts, LLMs can sometimes beat well-established benchmarks. This paper investigates how well LLMs perform in the task of forecasting corporate credit ratings. We show that while LLMs are very good at encoding textual information, traditional methods are still very competitive when it comes to encoding numeric and multimodal data. For our task, current LLMs perform worse than a more traditional XGBoost architecture that combines fundamental and macroeconomic data with high-density text-based embedding features.

> Residential load forecasting (RLF) is crucial for resource scheduling in power systems. Most existing methods utilize all given load records (dense data) to indiscriminately extract the dependencies between historical and future time series. However, there exist important regular patterns residing in the event-related associations among different appliances (sparse knowledge), which have yet been ignored.In this paper, we propose an Event-Response Knowledge Guided approach (ERKG) for RLF by incorporating the estimation of electricity usage events for different appliances, mining event-related sparse knowledge from the load series. With ERKG, the event-response estimation enables portraying the electricity consumption behaviors of residents, revealing regular variations in appliance operational states.To be specific, ERKG consists of knowledge extraction and guidance: i) a forecasting model is designed for the electricity usage events by estimating appliance operational states, aiming to extract the event-related sparse knowledge; ii) a novel knowledge-guided mechanism is established by fusing such state estimates of the appliance events into the RLF model, which can give particular focuses on the patterns of users' electricity consumption behaviors.Notably, ERKG can flexibly serve as a plug-in module to boost the capability of existing forecasting models by leveraging event response. In numerical experiments, extensive comparisons and ablation studies have verified the effectiveness of our ERKG, e.g., over 8% MAE can be reduced on the tested state-of-the-art forecasting models.

> Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable success, including in the open-source community, with many open-weight models available. However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.

> Fiber orientation is decisive for the mechanical properties and thus for the performance of composite materials. During manufacturing, variations in material and process parameters can significantly influence the exact fiber orientation. We employ multilevel polynomial surrogates to model the propagation of uncertain material properties in the injection molding process. To ensure reliable uncertainty quantification, a key focus is deriving novel error bounds for statistical measures of a quantity of interest, computed via these surrogates. To verify these bounds, we conduct numerical experiments using the Cross-WLF viscosity model alongside the Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel. In particular, the impact of uncertainties in fiber length and matrix temperature on the fractional anisotropy of fiber orientation is investigated. The Folgar-Tucker equation and the improved anisotropic rotary diffusion model are used, incorporating recently established analytical solutions of these models as part of our verification. Our results demonstrate that the investigated method significantly improves upon standard Monte Carlo estimation, while also providing error guarantees. These findings offer the first step toward a reliable and practical tool for optimizing fiber-reinforced polymer manufacturing processes in the future.

> We propose Samba ASR,the first state of the art Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR)model leveraging the novel Mamba architecture as both encoder and decoder,built on the foundation of state space models(SSMs).Unlike transformerbased ASR models,which rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies,Samba ASR effectively models both local and global temporal dependencies using efficient statespace dynamics,achieving remarkable performance gains.By addressing the limitations of transformers,such as quadratic scaling with input length and difficulty in handling longrange dependencies,Samba ASR achieves superior accuracy and efficiency.Experimental results demonstrate that Samba ASR surpasses existing opensource transformerbased ASR models across various standard benchmarks,establishing it as the new state of theart in ASR.Extensive evaluations on the benchmark dataset show significant improvements in Word Error Rate(WER),with competitive performance even in lowresource scenarios.Furthermore,the inherent computational efficiency and parameter optimization of the Mamba architecture make Samba ASR a scalable and robust solution for diverse ASR tasks.Our contributions include the development of a new Samba ASR architecture for automatic speech recognition(ASR),demonstrating the superiority of structured statespace models(SSMs)over transformer based models for speech sequence processing.We provide a comprehensive evaluation on public benchmarks,showcasing stateoftheart(SOTA)performance,and present an indepth analysis of computational efficiency,robustness to noise,and sequence generalization.This work highlights the viability of Mamba SSMs as a transformerfree alternative for efficient and accurate ASR.By leveraging the advancements of statespace modeling,Samba ASR redefines ASR performance standards and sets a new benchmark for future research in this field.

- *Ameet Gadekar, Tanmay Inamdar*

- `2501.03663v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03663v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03663v1)

> Hybrid $k$-Clustering is a model of clustering that generalizes two of the most widely studied clustering objectives: $k$-Center and $k$-Median. In this model, given a set of $n$ points $P$, the goal is to find $k$ centers such that the sum of the $r$-distances of each point to its nearest center is minimized. The $r$-distance between two points $p$ and $q$ is defined as $\max\{d(p, q)-r, 0\}$ -- this represents the distance of $p$ to the boundary of the $r$-radius ball around $q$ if $p$ is outside the ball, and $0$ otherwise. This problem was recently introduced by Fomin et al. [APPROX 2024], who designed a $(1+\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon)$-bicrtieria approximation that runs in time $2^{(kd/\varepsilon)^{O(1)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ for inputs in $\mathbb{R}^d$; such a bicriteria solution uses balls of radius $(1+\varepsilon)r$ instead of $r$, and has a cost at most $1+\varepsilon$ times the cost of an optimal solution using balls of radius $r$.   In this paper we significantly improve upon this result by designing an approximation algorithm with the same bicriteria guarantee, but with running time that is FPT only in $k$ and $\varepsilon$ -- crucially, removing the exponential dependence on the dimension $d$. This resolves an open question posed in their paper. Our results extend further in several directions. First, our approximation scheme works in a broader class of metric spaces, including doubling spaces, minor-free, and bounded treewidth metrics. Secondly, our techniques yield a similar bicriteria FPT-approximation schemes for other variants of Hybrid $k$-Clustering, e.g., when the objective features the sum of $z$-th power of the $r$-distances. Finally, we also design a coreset for Hybrid $k$-Clustering in doubling spaces, answering another open question from the work of Fomin et al.

> The generation of synthetic data with distributions that faithfully emulate the underlying data-generating mechanism holds paramount significance. Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) have emerged as a prominent tool for this task; however, due to the delicate equilibrium of the minimax formulation and the instability of Wasserstein distance in high dimensions, WGAN often manifests the pathological phenomenon of mode collapse. This results in generated samples that converge to a restricted set of outputs and fail to adequately capture the tail behaviors of the true distribution. Such limitations can lead to serious downstream consequences. To this end, we propose the Penalized Optimal Transport Network (POTNet), a versatile deep generative model based on the marginally-penalized Wasserstein (MPW) distance. Through the MPW distance, POTNet effectively leverages low-dimensional marginal information to guide the overall alignment of joint distributions. Furthermore, our primal-based framework enables direct evaluation of the MPW distance, thus eliminating the need for a critic network. This formulation circumvents training instabilities inherent in adversarial approaches and avoids the need for extensive parameter tuning. We derive a non-asymptotic bound on the generalization error of the MPW loss and establish convergence rates of the generative distribution learned by POTNet. Our theoretical analysis together with extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of POTNet in accurately capturing underlying data structures, including their tail behaviors and minor modalities. Moreover, our model achieves orders of magnitude speedup during the sampling stage compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, which enables computationally efficient large-scale synthetic data generation.

> This research focused on enhancing post-incident malware forensic investigation using reinforcement learning RL. We proposed an advanced MDP post incident malware forensics investigation model and framework to expedite post incident forensics. We then implement our RL Malware Investigation Model based on structured MDP within the proposed framework. To identify malware artefacts, the RL agent acquires and examines forensics evidence files, iteratively improving its capabilities using Q Table and temporal difference learning. The Q learning algorithm significantly improved the agent ability to identify malware. An epsilon greedy exploration strategy and Q learning updates enabled efficient learning and decision making. Our experimental testing revealed that optimal learning rates depend on the MDP environment complexity, with simpler environments benefiting from higher rates for quicker convergence and complex ones requiring lower rates for stability. Our model performance in identifying and classifying malware reduced malware analysis time compared to human experts, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The study highlighted the significance of hyper parameter tuning and suggested adaptive strategies for complex environments. Our RL based approach produced promising results and is validated as an alternative to traditional methods notably by offering continuous learning and adaptation to new and evolving malware threats which ultimately enhance the post incident forensics investigations.

> Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.

> Aiming at the latest particle swarm optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an improved Transformer model to improve the accuracy of heart disease prediction and provide a new algorithm idea. We first use three mainstream machine learning classification algorithms - decision tree, random forest and XGBoost, and then output the confusion matrix of these three models. The results showed that the random forest model had the best performance in predicting the classification of heart disease, with an accuracy of 92.2%. Then, we apply the Transformer model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to the same dataset for classification experiment. The results show that the classification accuracy of the model is as high as 96.5%, 4.3 percentage points higher than that of random forest, which verifies the effectiveness of PSO in optimizing Transformer model. From the above research, we can see that particle swarm optimization significantly improves Transformer performance in heart disease prediction. Improving the ability to predict heart disease is a global priority with benefits for all humankind. Accurate prediction can enhance public health, optimize medical resources, and reduce healthcare costs, leading to healthier populations and more productive societies worldwide. This advancement paves the way for more efficient health management and supports the foundation of a healthier, more resilient global community.

> Math Word Problem (MWP) solving is a critical task in natural language processing, has garnered significant research interest in recent years. Various recent studies heavily rely on Seq2Seq models and their extensions (e.g., Seq2Tree and Graph2Tree) to generate mathematical equations. While effective, these models struggle to generate diverse but counterpart solution equations, limiting their generalization across various math problem scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Diversity-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (DivKD) model for practical MWP solving. Our approach proposes an adaptive diversity distillation method, in which a student model learns diverse equations by selectively transferring high-quality knowledge from a teacher model. Additionally, we design a diversity prior-enhanced student model to better capture the diversity distribution of equations by incorporating a conditional variational auto-encoder. Extensive experiments on {four} MWP benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves higher answer accuracy than strong baselines while maintaining high efficiency for practical applications.

> This paper presents a framework for bounding the approximation error in imitation model predictive controllers utilizing neural networks. Leveraging the Lipschitz properties of these neural networks, we derive a bound that guides dataset design to ensure the approximation error remains at chosen limits. We discuss how this method can be used to design a stable neural network controller with performance guarantees employing existing robust model predictive control approaches for data generation. Additionally, we introduce a training adjustment, which is based on the sensitivities of the optimization problem and reduces dataset density requirements based on the derived bounds. We verify that the proposed augmentation results in improvements to the network's predictive capabilities and a reduction of the Lipschitz constant. Moreover, on a simulated inverted pendulum problem, we show that the approach results in a closer match of the closed-loop behavior between the imitation and the original model predictive controller.

> Action Quality Assessment (AQA), which aims at automatic and fair evaluation of athletic performance, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, athletes are often in rapid movement and the corresponding visual appearance variances are subtle, making it challenging to capture fine-grained pose differences and leading to poor estimation performance. Furthermore, most common AQA tasks, such as diving in sports, are usually divided into multiple sub-actions, each of which contains different durations. However, existing methods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the temporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment method through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Then, a procedure segmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain segmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are both fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to guide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances. Finally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to learn discriminative representations and output prediction results. In addition, we introduce a newly-annotated FineDiving-Pose Dataset to improve the current low-quality human pose labels. In experiments, the results on FineDiving and MTL-AQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach. Our source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Lumos0507/HP-MCoRe.

> In this work, we build upon the offline reinforcement learning algorithm TD7, which incorporates State-Action Learned Embeddings (SALE) and LAP, and propose a model-free actor-critic algorithm that integrates ensemble Q-networks and a gradient diversity penalty from EDAC. The ensemble Q-networks effectively address the challenge of out-of-distribution actions by introducing penalties that guide the actor network to focus on in-distribution actions. Meanwhile, the gradient diversity penalty encourages diverse Q-value gradients, further suppressing overestimation for out-of-distribution actions. Additionally, our method retains an adjustable behavior cloning (BC) term that directs the actor network toward dataset actions during early training stages, while gradually reducing its influence as the precision of the Q-ensemble improves. These enhancements work synergistically to improve training stability and accuracy. Experimental results on the D4RL MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior convergence speed, stability, and performance compared to existing methods.

> Standard datasets are frequently used to train and evaluate Machine Learning models. However, the assumed standardness of these datasets leads to a lack of in-depth discussion on how their labels match the derived categories for the respective use case, which we demonstrate by reviewing recent literature that employs standard datasets. We find that the standardness of the datasets seems to cloud their actual coherency and applicability, thus impeding the trust in Machine Learning models trained on these datasets. Therefore, we argue against the uncritical use of standard datasets and advocate for their critical examination instead. For this, we suggest to use Grounded Theory in combination with Hypotheses Testing through Visualization as methods to evaluate the match between use case, derived categories, and labels. We exemplify this approach by applying it to the 20 Newsgroups dataset and the MNIST dataset, both considered standard datasets in their respective domain. The results show that the labels of the 20 Newsgroups dataset are imprecise, which implies that neither a Machine Learning model can learn a meaningful abstraction of derived categories nor one can draw conclusions from achieving high accuracy on this dataset. For the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that the labels can be confirmed to be defined well. We conclude that also for datasets that are considered to be standard, quality and suitability have to be assessed in order to learn meaningful abstractions and, thus, improve trust in Machine Learning models.

> Despite the significant improvements achieved by large language models (LLMs) in English reasoning tasks, these models continue to struggle with multilingual reasoning. Recent studies leverage a full-parameter and two-stage training paradigm to teach models to first understand non-English questions and then reason. However, this method suffers from both substantial computational resource computing and catastrophic forgetting. The fundamental cause is that, with the primary goal of enhancing multilingual comprehension, an excessive number of irrelevant layers and parameters are tuned during the first stage. Given our findings that the representation learning of languages is merely conducted in lower-level layers, we propose an efficient multilingual reasoning alignment approach that precisely identifies and fine-tunes the layers responsible for handling multilingualism. Experimental results show that our method, SLAM, only tunes 6 layers' feed-forward sub-layers including 6.5-8% of all parameters within 7B and 13B LLMs, achieving superior average performance than all strong baselines across 10 languages. Meanwhile, SLAM only involves one training stage, reducing training time by 4.1-11.9 compared to the two-stage method.

> Bacterial cells use run-and-tumble motion to climb up attractant concentration gradient in their environment. By extending the uphill runs and shortening the downhill runs the cells migrate towards the higher attractant zones. Motivated by this, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm where an agent moves in one dimension in the presence of an attractant gradient. The agent can perform two actions: either persistent motion in the same direction or reversal of direction. We assign costs for these actions based on the recent history of the agent's trajectory. We ask the question: which RL strategy works best in different types of attractant environment. We quantify efficiency of the RL strategy by the ability of the agent (a) to localize in the favorable zones after large times, and (b) to learn about its complete environment. Depending on the attractant profile and the initial condition, we find an optimum balance is needed between exploration and exploitation to ensure the most efficient performance.

> Music source separation and pitch estimation are two vital tasks in music information retrieval. Typically, the input of pitch estimation is obtained from the output of music source separation. Therefore, existing methods have tried to perform these two tasks simultaneously, so as to leverage the mutually beneficial relationship between both tasks. However, these methods still face two critical challenges that limit the improvement of both tasks: the lack of labeled data and joint learning optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a Model-Agnostic Joint Learning (MAJL) framework for both tasks. MAJL is a generic framework and can use variant models for each task. It includes a two-stage training method and a dynamic weighting method named Dynamic Weights on Hard Samples (DWHS), which addresses the lack of labeled data and joint learning optimization, respectively. Experimental results on public music datasets show that MAJL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both tasks, with significant improvements of 0.92 in Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) for music source separation and 2.71% in Raw Pitch Accuracy (RPA) for pitch estimation. Furthermore, comprehensive studies not only validate the effectiveness of each component of MAJL, but also indicate the great generality of MAJL in adapting to different model architectures.

> In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. For this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions, and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation of why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.

> Music timbre transfer is a challenging task that involves modifying the timbral characteristics of an audio signal while preserving its melodic structure. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on dual diffusion bridges, trained using the CocoChorales Dataset, which consists of unpaired monophonic single-instrument audio data. Each diffusion model is trained on a specific instrument with a Gaussian prior. During inference, a model is designated as the source model to map the input audio to its corresponding Gaussian prior, and another model is designated as the target model to reconstruct the target audio from this Gaussian prior, thereby facilitating timbre transfer. We compare our approach against existing unsupervised timbre transfer models such as VAEGAN and Gaussian Flow Bridges (GFB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both better Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and melody preservation, as reflected by lower pitch distances (DPD) compared to VAEGAN and GFB. Additionally, we discover that the noise level from the Gaussian prior, $\sigma$, can be adjusted to control the degree of melody preservation and amount of timbre transferred.

> With the advancement of blockchain technology, chained Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols have been increasingly adopted in practical systems, making their performance a crucial aspect of the study. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework utilizing Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to model and assess the performance of three prominent chained BFT protocols. Our framework effectively captures complex adversarial behaviors, focusing on two key performance metrics: chain growth and commitment rate. We implement the optimal attack strategies obtained from MDP analysis on an existing evaluation platform for chained BFT protocols and conduct extensive experiments under various settings to validate our theoretical results. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and thorough practical experiments, we provide an in-depth evaluation of chained BFT protocols under diverse attack scenarios, uncovering optimal attack strategies. Contrary to conventional belief, our findings reveal that while responsiveness can enhance performance, it is not universally beneficial across all scenarios. This work not only deepens our understanding of chained BFT protocols, but also offers valuable insights and analytical tools that can inform the design of more robust and efficient protocols.

> Generating molecular graphs is a challenging task due to their discrete nature and the competitive objectives involved. Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

> Identifying an appropriate function space for deep neural networks remains a key open question. While shallow neural networks are naturally associated with Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS), deep networks present unique challenges. In this work, we extend RKBS to chain RKBS (cRKBS), a new framework that composes kernels rather than functions, preserving the desirable properties of RKBS. We prove that any deep neural network function is a neural cRKBS function, and conversely, any neural cRKBS function defined on a finite dataset corresponds to a deep neural network. This approach provides a sparse solution to the empirical risk minimization problem, requiring no more than $N$ neurons per layer, where $N$ is the number of data points.

> This paper presents the process of building a neural machine translation system with support for English, Romanian, and Aromanian - an endangered Eastern Romance language. The primary contribution of this research is twofold: (1) the creation of the most extensive Aromanian-Romanian parallel corpus to date, consisting of 79,000 sentence pairs, and (2) the development and comparative analysis of several machine translation models optimized for Aromanian. To accomplish this, we introduce a suite of auxiliary tools, including a language-agnostic sentence embedding model for text mining and automated evaluation, complemented by a diacritics conversion system for different writing standards.

> Monocular 3D object detection is a challenging task in autonomous systems due to the lack of explicit depth information in single-view images. Existing methods often depend on external depth estimators or expensive sensors, which increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose AuxDepthNet, an efficient framework for real-time monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on external depth maps or pre-trained depth models. AuxDepthNet introduces two key components: the Auxiliary Depth Feature (ADF) module, which implicitly learns depth-sensitive features to improve spatial reasoning and computational efficiency, and the Depth Position Mapping (DPM) module, which embeds depth positional information directly into the detection process to enable accurate object localization and 3D bounding box regression. Leveraging the DepthFusion Transformer architecture, AuxDepthNet globally integrates visual and depth-sensitive features through depth-guided interactions, ensuring robust and efficient detection. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that AuxDepthNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with $\text{AP}_{3D}$ scores of 24.72\% (Easy), 18.63\% (Moderate), and 15.31\% (Hard), and $\text{AP}_{\text{BEV}}$ scores of 34.11\% (Easy), 25.18\% (Moderate), and 21.90\% (Hard) at an IoU threshold of 0.7.

> Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to LLMs form Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced various downstream graph-relevant tasks, encompassing recommender systems, molecular structure prediction, social media analysis, etc. Despite the boosts of GNN, recent research has empirically demonstrated its potential vulnerability to backdoor attacks, wherein adversaries employ triggers to poison input samples, inducing GNN to adversary-premeditated malicious outputs. This is typically due to the controlled training process, or the deployment of untrusted models, such as delegating model training to third-party service, leveraging external training sets, and employing pre-trained models from online sources. Although there's an ongoing increase in research on GNN backdoors, comprehensive investigation into this field is lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose the first survey dedicated to GNN backdoors. We begin by outlining the fundamental definition of GNN, followed by the detailed summarization and categorization of current GNN backdoor attacks and defenses based on their technical characteristics and application scenarios. Subsequently, the analysis of the applicability and use cases of GNN backdoors is undertaken. Finally, the exploration of potential research directions of GNN backdoors is presented. This survey aims to explore the principles of graph backdoors, provide insights to defenders, and promote future security research.

> In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised approach for Speech Segmentation, which builds on previously researched approaches, e.g., Speaker Diarization, while being applicable to an inclusive set of acoustic-semantic distinctions, paving a path towards a general Unsupervised Speech Segmentation approach. Unlike traditional speech and audio segmentation, which mainly focuses on spectral changes in the input signal, e.g., phone segmentation, our approach tries to segment the spoken utterance into chunks with differing acoustic-semantic styles, focusing on acoustic-semantic information that does not translate well into text, e.g., emotion or speaker. While most Speech Segmentation tasks only handle one style change, e.g., emotion diarization, our approach tries to handle multiple acoustic-semantic style changes. Leveraging recent advances in Speech Language Models (SLMs), we propose a simple unsupervised method to segment a given speech utterance. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by considering several setups. Results suggest that the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines on boundary detection, segment purity, and over-segmentation.

> Data augmentation has shown significant advancements in computer vision to improve model performance over the years, particularly in scenarios with limited and insufficient data. Currently, most studies focus on adjusting the image or its features to expand the size, quality, and variety of samples during training in various tasks including object detection. However, we argue that it is necessary to investigate bounding box transformations as a data augmentation technique rather than image-level transformations, especially in aerial imagery due to potentially inconsistent bounding box annotations. Hence, this letter presents a thorough investigation of bounding box transformation in terms of scaling, rotation, and translation for remote sensing object detection. We call this augmentation strategy NBBOX (Noise Injection into Bounding Box). We conduct extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R, both well-known datasets that include a variety of rotated generic objects in aerial images. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves remote sensing object detection without whistles and bells and it is more time-efficient than other state-of-the-art augmentation strategies.

> Autoregressive construction approaches generate solutions to vehicle routing problems in a step-by-step fashion, leading to high-quality solutions that are nearing the performance achieved by handcrafted, operations research techniques. In this work, we challenge the conventional paradigm of sequential solution construction and introduce an iterative search framework where solutions are instead deconstructed by a neural policy. Throughout the search, the neural policy collaborates with a simple greedy insertion algorithm to rebuild the deconstructed solutions. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art operations research methods across three challenging vehicle routing problems of various problem sizes.

> To perform image editing based on single-view, inverse physically based rendering, we present a method combining a learning-based approach with progressive differentiable rendering. Given an image, our method leverages neural networks to predict initial material properties. Progressive differentiable rendering is then used to optimize the environment map and refine the material properties with the goal of closely matching the rendered result to the input image. We require only a single image while other inverse rendering methods based on the rendering equation require multiple views. In comparison to single-view methods that rely on neural renderers, our approach achieves more realistic light material interactions, accurate shadows, and global illumination. Furthermore, with optimized material properties and illumination, our method enables a variety of tasks, including physically based material editing, object insertion, and relighting. We also propose a method for material transparency editing that operates effectively without requiring full scene geometry. Compared with methods based on Stable Diffusion, our approach offers stronger interpretability and more realistic light refraction based on empirical results.

> Decision trees, owing to their interpretability, are attractive as control policies for (dynamical) systems. Unfortunately, constructing, or synthesising, such policies is a challenging task. Previous approaches do so by imitating a neural-network policy, approximating a tabular policy obtained via formal synthesis, employing reinforcement learning, or modelling the problem as a mixed-integer linear program. However, these works may require access to a hard-to-obtain accurate policy or a formal model of the environment (within reach of formal synthesis), and may not provide guarantees on the quality or size of the final tree policy. In contrast, we present an approach to synthesise optimal decision-tree policies given a deterministic black-box environment and specification, a discretisation of the tree predicates, and an initial set of states, where optimality is defined with respect to the number of steps to achieve the goal. Our approach is a specialised search algorithm which systematically explores the (exponentially large) space of decision trees under the given discretisation. The key component is a novel trace-based pruning mechanism that significantly reduces the search space. Our approach represents a conceptually novel way of synthesising small decision-tree policies with optimality guarantees even for black-box environments with black-box specifications.

> Accurate segmentation of pulmonary structures iscrucial in clinical diagnosis, disease study, and treatment planning. Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, but most require much labeled data for training. Consequently, developing precise segmentation methods that demand fewer labeled datasets is paramount in medical image analysis. The emergence of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, recently opened the door for universal computer vision tasks. Exploiting the generalization ability of these pre-trained foundation models on downstream tasks, such as segmentation, leads to unexpected performance with a relatively small amount of labeled data. However, exploring these models for pulmonary artery-vein segmentation is still limited. This paper proposes a novel framework called Language-guided self-adaptive Cross-Attention Fusion Framework. Our method adopts pre-trained CLIP as a strong feature extractor for generating the segmentation of 3D CT scans, while adaptively aggregating the cross-modality of text and image representations. We propose a s pecially designed adapter module to fine-tune pre-trained CLIP with a self-adaptive learning strategy to effectively fuse the two modalities of embeddings. We extensively validate our method on a local dataset, which is the largest pulmonary artery-vein CT dataset to date and consists of 718 labeled data in total. The experiments show that our method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our data and code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

> The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable multilingual capabilities in natural language processing, attracting global attention in both academia and industry. To mitigate potential discrimination and enhance the overall usability and accessibility for diverse language user groups, it is important for the development of language-fair technology. Despite the breakthroughs of LLMs, the investigation into the multilingual scenario remains insufficient, where a comprehensive survey to summarize recent approaches, developments, limitations, and potential solutions is desirable. To this end, we provide a survey with multiple perspectives on the utilization of LLMs in the multilingual scenario. We first rethink the transitions between previous and current research on pre-trained language models. Then we introduce several perspectives on the multilingualism of LLMs, including training and inference methods, information retrieval, model security, multi-domain with language culture, and usage of datasets. We also discuss the major challenges that arise in these aspects, along with possible solutions. Besides, we highlight future research directions that aim at further enhancing LLMs with multilingualism. The survey aims to help the research community address multilingual problems and provide a comprehensive understanding of the core concepts, key techniques, and latest developments in multilingual natural language processing based on LLMs.

> Early detection of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is crucial for timely intervention and disease management. Speech analysis offers a non-intrusive and scalable screening method, particularly through narrative tasks in neuropsychological assessment tools. Traditional narrative analysis often focuses on local indicators in microstructure, such as word usage and syntax. While these features provide insights into language production abilities, they often fail to capture global narrative patterns, or microstructures. Macrostructures include coherence, thematic organization, and logical progressions, reflecting essential cognitive skills potentially critical for recognizing NCDs. Addressing this gap, we propose to investigate specific cognitive and linguistic challenges by analyzing topical shifts, temporal dynamics, and the coherence of narratives over time, aiming to reveal cognitive deficits by identifying narrative impairments, and exploring their impact on communication and cognition. The investigation is based on the CU-MARVEL Rabbit Story corpus, which comprises recordings of a story-telling task from 758 older adults. We developed two approaches: the Dynamic Topic Models (DTM)-based temporal analysis to examine the evolution of topics over time, and the Text-Image Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) to evaluate the coherence between spoken narratives and visual stimuli. DTM-based approach validated the effectiveness of dynamic topic consistency as a macrostructural metric (F1=0.61, AUC=0.78). The TITAN approach achieved the highest performance (F1=0.72, AUC=0.81), surpassing established microstructural and macrostructural feature sets. Cross-comparison and regression tasks further demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed dynamic macrostructural modeling approaches for NCD detection.

> We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.

> Containerization is the mainstream of current software development, which enables software to be used across platforms without additional configuration of running environment. However, many images created by developers are redundant and contain unnecessary code, packages, and components. This excess not only leads to bloated images that are cumbersome to transmit and store but also increases the attack surface, making them more vulnerable to security threats. Therefore, image slimming has emerged as a significant area of interest. Nevertheless, existing image slimming technologies face challenges, particularly regarding the incomplete extraction of environment dependencies required by project code. In this paper, we present a novel image slimming model named {\delta}-SCALPEL. This model employs static data dependency analysis to extract the environment dependencies of the project code and utilizes a data structure called the command linked list for modeling the image's file system. We select 20 NPM projects and two official Docker Hub images to construct a dataset for evaluating {\delta}-SCALPEL. The evaluation results show that {\delta}-SCALPEL can reduce image sizes by up to 61.4% while ensuring the normal operation of these projects.

> Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.

> An accurate AI-based diagnostic system for induction motors (IMs) holds the potential to enhance proactive maintenance, mitigating unplanned downtime and curbing overall maintenance costs within an industrial environment. Notably, among the prevalent faults in IMs, a Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) fault is frequently encountered. Researchers have proposed various fault diagnosis approaches using signal processing (SP), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid architectures for BRB faults. One limitation in the existing literature is the training of these architectures on relatively small datasets, risking overfitting when implementing such systems in industrial environments. This paper addresses this limitation by implementing large-scale data of BRB faults by using a transfer-learning-based lightweight DL model named ShuffleNetV2 for diagnosing one, two, three, and four BRB faults using current and vibration signal data. Spectral images for training and testing are generated using a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The dataset comprises 57,500 images, with 47,500 used for training and 10,000 for testing. Remarkably, the ShuffleNetV2 model exhibited superior performance, in less computational cost as well as accurately classifying 98.856% of spectral images. To further enhance the visualization of harmonic sidebands resulting from broken bars, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to current and vibration data. The paper also provides insights into the training and testing times for each model, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed fault diagnosis methodology. The findings of our research provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of different ML and DL models, offering a foundation for the development of robust fault diagnosis systems for induction motors in industrial settings.

> Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.

> Despite recent advances, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are still far from perfect. Typical errors include acronyms, named entities, and domain-specific special words for which little or no labeled data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose a self-supervised continual learning approach: Given the audio of a lecture talk with the corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from the literature. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation data set. Continual learning is then performed by training adaptation weights added to the model on this data set. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.

> The evolution of digital image manipulation, particularly with the advancement of deep generative models, significantly challenges existing deepfake detection methods, especially when the origin of the deepfake is obscure. To tackle the increasing complexity of these forgeries, we propose \textbf{Wavelet-CLIP}, a deepfake detection framework that integrates wavelet transforms with features derived from the ViT-L/14 architecture, pre-trained in the CLIP fashion. Wavelet-CLIP utilizes Wavelet Transforms to deeply analyze both spatial and frequency features from images, thus enhancing the model's capability to detect sophisticated deepfakes. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations against existing state-of-the-art methods for cross-dataset generalization and detection of unseen images generated by standard diffusion models. Our method showcases outstanding performance, achieving an average AUC of 0.749 for cross-data generalization and 0.893 for robustness against unseen deepfakes, outperforming all compared methods.

Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that specialized Polish language models achieve superior performance compared to multilingual alternatives, with transformer-based architectures showing particular strength in handling imbalanced categories.

> In the field of industrial inspection, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have a high potential to renew the paradigms in practical applications due to their robust language capabilities and generalization abilities. However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.

> The simulation of electromagnetic devices with complex geometries and large-scale discrete systems benefits from advanced computational methods like IsoGeometric Analysis and Domain Decomposition. In this paper, we employ both concepts in an Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method to enable the use of parallel computations for magnetostatic problems. We address the underlying non-uniqueness by using a graph-theoretic approach, the tree-cotree decomposition. The classical tree-cotree gauging is adapted to be feasible for parallelization, which requires that all local subsystems are uniquely solvable. Our contribution consists of an explicit algorithm for constructing compatible trees and combining it with a dual-primal approach to enable parallelization. The correctness of the proposed approach is proved and verified by numerical experiments, showing its accuracy, scalability and optimal convergence.

We then attempt to generalize these techniques when the dictionary is a product of a few Householder matrices. We numerically validate these techniques in the sample-limited setting to show performance similar to or better than existing techniques while having much improved computational complexity.

> Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models that are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedastic Gaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian corruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models have been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy and robustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against sparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential selection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as relevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterized such that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in the data-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust regression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weak submodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby proves approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's performance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian optimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse corruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.

> In practical sleep stage classification, a key challenge is the variability of EEG data across different subjects and environments. Differences in physiology, age, health status, and recording conditions can lead to domain shifts between data. These domain shifts often result in decreased model accuracy and reliability, particularly when the model is applied to new data with characteristics different from those it was originally trained on, which is a typical manifestation of negative transfer. To address this, we propose SelectiveFinetuning in this paper. Our method utilizes a pretrained Multi Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) to extract EEG features, capturing the distinctive characteristics of different sleep stages. To mitigate the effect of domain shifts, we introduce a domain aligning mechanism that employs Earth Mover Distance (EMD) to evaluate and select source domain data closely matching the target domain. By finetuning the model with selective source data, our SelectiveFinetuning enhances the model's performance on target domain that exhibits domain shifts compared to the data used for training. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines, offering greater robustness and adaptability in practical scenarios where data distributions are often unpredictable.

> Expected Improvement (EI) is arguably the most popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimization and has found countless successful applications, but its performance is often exceeded by that of more recent methods. Notably, EI and its variants, including for the parallel and multi-objective settings, are challenging to optimize because their acquisition values vanish numerically in many regions. This difficulty generally increases as the number of observations, dimensionality of the search space, or the number of constraints grow, resulting in performance that is inconsistent across the literature and most often sub-optimal. Herein, we propose LogEI, a new family of acquisition functions whose members either have identical or approximately equal optima as their canonical counterparts, but are substantially easier to optimize numerically. We demonstrate that numerical pathologies manifest themselves in "classic" analytic EI, Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI), as well as their constrained, noisy, and parallel variants, and propose corresponding reformulations that remedy these pathologies. Our empirical results show that members of the LogEI family of acquisition functions substantially improve on the optimization performance of their canonical counterparts and surprisingly, are on par with or exceed the performance of recent state-of-the-art acquisition functions, highlighting the understated role of numerical optimization in the literature.

> Urbanization and technological advancements are reshaping urban mobility, presenting both challenges and opportunities. This paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven technologies can impact traffic congestion dynamics and explores their potential to enhance transportation systems' efficiency. Specifically, we assess the role of AI innovations, such as autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic management, in mitigating congestion under varying regulatory frameworks. Autonomous vehicles reduce congestion through optimized traffic flow, real-time route adjustments, and decreased human errors.   The study employs Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model the dynamic relationship between AI adoption rates and traffic congestion, capturing systemic feedback loops. Quantitative outputs include threshold levels of AI adoption needed to achieve significant congestion reduction, while qualitative insights stem from scenario planning exploring regulatory and societal conditions. This dual-method approach offers actionable strategies for policymakers to create efficient, sustainable, and equitable urban transportation systems. While safety implications of AI are acknowledged, this study primarily focuses on congestion reduction dynamics.

> Music genres are shaped by both the stylistic features of songs and the cultural preferences of artists' audiences. Automatic classification of music genres using lyrics can be useful in several applications such as recommendation systems, playlist creation, and library organization. We present a multi-label, cross-lingual genre classification system based on multilingual sentence embeddings generated by sBERT. Using a bilingual Portuguese-English dataset with eight overlapping genres, we demonstrate the system's ability to train on lyrics in one language and predict genres in another. Our approach outperforms the baseline approach of translating lyrics and using a bag-of-words representation, improving the genrewise average F1-Score from 0.35 to 0.69. The classifier uses a one-vs-all architecture, enabling it to assign multiple genre labels to a single lyric. Experimental results reveal that dataset centralization notably improves cross-lingual performance. This approach offers a scalable solution for genre classification across underrepresented languages and cultural domains, advancing the capabilities of music information retrieval systems.

> This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption (BoRA), a novel method for finetuning multi-task Large Language Models (LLMs). Current finetuning approaches, such as Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), perform exeptionally well in reducing training parameters and memory usage but face limitations when applied to multiple similar tasks. Practitioners usually have to choose between training separate models for each task or a single model for all tasks, both of which come with trade-offs in specialization and data utilization. BoRA addresses these trade-offs by leveraging a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows tasks to share information through global hierarchical priors. This enables tasks with limited data to benefit from the overall structure derived from related tasks while allowing tasks with more data to specialize. Our experimental results show that BoRA outperforms both individual and unified model approaches, achieving lower perplexity and better generalization across tasks. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-task LLM finetuning, with significant practical implications for diverse applications.

> Leveraging multimodal data is an inherent requirement for comprehending geographic objects. However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

> Large language models (LLMs) combined with tool learning have gained impressive results in real-world applications. During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.

> Quantum state tomography (QST) is the process of reconstructing the complete state of a quantum system (mathematically described as a density matrix) through a series of different measurements. These measurements are performed on a number of identical copies of the quantum system, with outcomes gathered as frequencies. QST aims to recover the density matrix or the properties of the quantum state from the measured frequencies. Although an informationally complete set of measurements can specify the quantum state accurately in an ideal scenario with a large number of identical copies, both the measurements and identical copies are restricted and imperfect in practical scenarios, making QST highly ill-posed. The conventional QST methods usually assume accurate measured frequencies or rely on manually designed regularizers to handle the ill-posed reconstruction problem, suffering from limited applications in realistic scenarios. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNN) led to the emergence of deep learning in QST. However, existing DL-based QST approaches often employ generic DNN models that are not optimized for imperfect conditions of QST. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder architecture tailored for QST with imperfect measurement data. Our method leverages a transformer-based encoder to extract an informative latent representation (ILR) from imperfect measurement data and employs a decoder to predict the quantum states based on the ILR. We anticipate that the high-dimensional ILR will capture more comprehensive information about the quantum states. To achieve this, we conduct pre-training of the encoder using a pretext task that involves reconstructing high-quality frequencies from measured frequencies. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of the informative latent representation to deal with imperfect measurement data in QST.

> Hyperbolic spaces allow for more efficient modeling of complex, hierarchical structures, which is particularly beneficial in tasks involving multi-modal data. Although hyperbolic geometries have been proven effective for language-image pre-training, their capabilities to unify language, image, and 3D Point Cloud modalities are under-explored. We extend the 3D Point Cloud modality in hyperbolic multi-modal contrastive pre-training. Additionally, we explore the entailment, modality gap, and alignment regularizers for learning hierarchical 3D embeddings and facilitating the transfer of knowledge from both Text and Image modalities. These regularizers enable the learning of intra-modal hierarchy within each modality and inter-modal hierarchy across text, 2D images, and 3D Point Clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed training strategy yields an outstanding 3D Point Cloud encoder, and the obtained 3D Point Cloud hierarchical embeddings significantly improve performance on various downstream tasks.

> Multiple instance learning (MIL) is an effective and widely used approach for weakly supervised machine learning. In histopathology, MIL models have achieved remarkable success in tasks like tumor detection, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognostication. However, MIL explanation methods are still lagging behind, as they are limited to small bag sizes or disregard instance interactions. We revisit MIL through the lens of explainable AI (XAI) and introduce xMIL, a refined framework with more general assumptions. We demonstrate how to obtain improved MIL explanations using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and conduct extensive evaluation experiments on three toy settings and four real-world histopathology datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms previous explanation attempts with particularly improved faithfulness scores on challenging biomarker prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase how xMIL explanations enable pathologists to extract insights from MIL models, representing a significant advance for knowledge discovery and model debugging in digital histopathology.

> While ViTs have achieved across machine learning tasks, deploying them in real-world scenarios faces a critical challenge: generalizing under OoD shifts. A crucial research gap exists in understanding how to design ViT architectures, both manually and automatically, for better OoD generalization. To this end, we introduce OoD-ViT-NAS, the first systematic benchmark for ViTs NAS focused on OoD generalization. This benchmark includes 3000 ViT architectures of varying computational budgets evaluated on 8 common OoD datasets. Using this benchmark, we analyze factors contributing to OoD generalization. Our findings reveal key insights. First, ViT architecture designs significantly affect OoD generalization. Second, ID accuracy is often a poor indicator of OoD accuracy, highlighting the risk of optimizing ViT architectures solely for ID performance. Third, we perform the first study of NAS for ViTs OoD robustness, analyzing 9 Training-free NAS methods. We find that existing Training-free NAS methods are largely ineffective in predicting OoD accuracy despite excelling at ID accuracy. Simple proxies like Param or Flop surprisingly outperform complex Training-free NAS methods in predicting OoD accuracy. Finally, we study how ViT architectural attributes impact OoD generalization and discover that increasing embedding dimensions generally enhances performance. Our benchmark shows that ViT architectures exhibit a wide range of OoD accuracy, with up to 11.85% improvement for some OoD shifts. This underscores the importance of studying ViT architecture design for OoD. We believe OoD-ViT-NAS can catalyze further research into how ViT designs influence OoD generalization.

> Pre-training a language model and then fine-tuning it has shown to be an efficient and effective technique for a wide range of code intelligence tasks, such as code generation, code summarization, and vulnerability detection. However, pretraining language models on a large-scale code corpus is computationally expensive. Fortunately, many off-the-shelf Pre-trained Code Models (PCMs), such as CodeBERT, CodeT5, CodeGen, and Code Llama, have been released publicly. These models acquire general code understanding and generation capability during pretraining, which enhances their performance on downstream code intelligence tasks. With an increasing number of these public pre-trained models, selecting the most suitable one to reuse for a specific task is essential. In this paper, we systematically investigate the reusability of PCMs. We first explore three intuitive model selection methods that select by size, training data, or brute-force fine-tuning. Experimental results show that these straightforward techniques either perform poorly or suffer high costs. Motivated by these findings, we explore learning-based model selection strategies that utilize pre-trained models without altering their parameters. Specifically, we train proxy models to gauge the performance of pre-trained models, and measure the distribution deviation between a model's latent features and the task's labels, using their closeness as an indicator of model transferability. We conduct experiments on 100 widely-used opensource PCMs for code intelligence tasks, with sizes ranging from 42.5 million to 3 billion parameters. The results demonstrate that learning-based selection methods reduce selection time to 100 seconds, compared to 2,700 hours with brute-force fine-tuning, with less than 6% performance degradation across related tasks.

> Despite the considerable performance improvements of face recognition algorithms in recent years, the same scientific advances responsible for this progress can also be used to create efficient ways to attack them, posing a threat to their secure deployment. Morphing attack detection (MAD) systems aim to detect a specific type of threat, morphing attacks, at an early stage, preventing them from being considered for verification in critical processes. Foundation models (FM) learn from extensive amounts of unlabeled data, achieving remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen domains. Although this generalization capacity might be weak when dealing with domain-specific downstream tasks such as MAD, FMs can easily adapt to these settings while retaining the built-in knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we recognize the potential of FMs to perform well in the MAD task when properly adapted to its specificities. To this end, we adapt FM CLIP architectures with LoRA weights while simultaneously training a classification header. The proposed framework, MADation surpasses our alternative FM and transformer-based frameworks and constitutes the first adaption of FMs to the MAD task. MADation presents competitive results with current MAD solutions in the literature and even surpasses them in several evaluation scenarios. To encourage reproducibility and facilitate further research in MAD, we publicly release the implementation of MADation at https: //github.com/gurayozgur/MADation

> Query-focused summarization (QFS) aims to produce summaries that answer particular questions of interest, enabling greater user control and personalization. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), shows their impressive capability of textual understanding through large-scale pretraining, which implies the great potential of extractive snippet generation. In this paper, we systematically investigated two indispensable characteristics that the LLMs-based QFS models should be harnessed, Lengthy Document Summarization and Efficiently Fine-grained Query-LLM Alignment, respectively. Correspondingly, we propose two modules called Query-aware HyperExpert and Query-focused Infini-attention to access the aforementioned characteristics. These innovations pave the way for broader application and accessibility in the field of QFS technology. Extensive experiments conducted on existing QFS benchmarks indicate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach.

> Neural speech editing advancements have raised concerns about their misuse in spoofing attacks. Traditional partially edited speech corpora primarily focus on cut-and-paste edits, which, while maintaining speaker consistency, often introduce detectable discontinuities. Recent methods, like A\textsuperscript{3}T and Voicebox, improve transitions by leveraging contextual information. To foster spoofing detection research, we introduce the Speech INfilling Edit (SINE) dataset, created with Voicebox. We detailed the process of re-implementing Voicebox training and dataset creation. Subjective evaluations confirm that speech edited using this novel technique is more challenging to detect than conventional cut-and-paste methods. Despite human difficulty, experimental results demonstrate that self-supervised-based detectors can achieve remarkable performance in detection, localization, and generalization across different edit methods. The dataset and related models will be made publicly available.

- `2501.01460v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01460v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01460v2)

> In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR reconstruction by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose Wavelet Loss, a loss function that effectively captures high-frequency detail information in images, thereby enhancing the visual quality of SR, particularly in terms of detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including AID, AID_CDM, RSSRD-QH, and RSSRD-QH_CDM, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.05 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 2.9 times faster. Furthermore, the Wavelet Loss shows excellent generalization across various architectures, providing a novel perspective for RSI-SR enhancement.

> Distributed ledger technology offers several advantages for banking and finance industry, including efficient transaction processing and cross-party transaction reconciliation. The key challenges for adoption of this technology in financial institutes are (a) the building of a privacy-preserving ledger, (b) supporting auditing and regulatory requirements, and (c) flexibility to adapt to complex use-cases with multiple digital assets and actors. This paper proposes a framework for a private, audit-able, and distributed ledger (PADL) that adapts easily to fundamental use-cases within financial institutes. PADL employs widely-used cryptography schemes combined with zero-knowledge proofs to propose a transaction scheme for a `table' like ledger. It enables fast confidential peer-to-peer multi-asset transactions, and transaction graph anonymity, in a no-trust setup, but with customized privacy. We prove that integrity and anonymity of PADL is secured against a strong threat model. Furthermore, we showcase three fundamental real-life use-cases, namely, an assets exchange ledger, a settlement ledger, and a bond market ledger. Based on these use-cases we show that PADL supports smooth-lined inter-assets auditing while preserving privacy of the participants. For example, we show how a bank can be audited for its liquidity or credit risk without violation of privacy of itself or any other party, or how can PADL ensures honest coupon rate payment in bond market without sharing investors values. Finally, our evaluation shows PADL's advantage in performance against previous relevant schemes.

> Representation learning and \emph{de novo} generation of proteins are pivotal computational biology tasks. Whilst natural language processing (NLP) techniques have proven highly effective for protein sequence modelling, structure modelling presents a complex challenge, primarily due to its continuous and three-dimensional nature. Motivated by this discrepancy, we introduce an approach using a vector-quantized autoencoder that effectively tokenizes protein structures into discrete representations. This method transforms the continuous, complex space of protein structures into a manageable, discrete format with a codebook ranging from 4096 to 64000 tokens, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions with backbone root mean square deviations (RMSD) of approximately 1-5 \AA. To demonstrate the efficacy of our learned representations, we show that a simple GPT model trained on our codebooks can generate novel, diverse, and designable protein structures. Our approach not only provides representations of protein structure, but also mitigates the challenges of disparate modal representations and sets a foundation for seamless, multi-modal integration, enhancing the capabilities of computational methods in protein design.

> Despite significant advancements in causal research on graphs and its application to cracking label imbalance, the role of edge features in detecting the causal effects within graphs has been largely overlooked, leaving existing methods with untapped potential for further performance gains. In this paper, we enhance the causal attention mechanism through effectively leveraging edge information to disentangle the causal subgraph from the original graph, as well as further utilizing edge features to reshape graph representations. Capturing more comprehensive causal signals, our design leads to improved performance on graph classification tasks with label imbalance issues. We evaluate our approach on real-word datasets PTC, Tox21, and ogbg-molhiv, observing improvements over baselines. Overall, we highlight the importance of edge features in graph causal detection and provide a promising direction for addressing label imbalance challenges in graph-level tasks.

> Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving an 99.1% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.

- `2501.03821v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03821v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03821v1)

> Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the data and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and scale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different ways to normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on the resulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on this topic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying normalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We focus on normal and binary features and show that the class balances of binary features directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effect depends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. We demonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features with their variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of ridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty weights, rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we also tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and provide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.

> Effective evaluation of real-time strategy tasks requires adaptive mechanisms to cope with dynamic and unpredictable environments. This study proposes a method to improve evaluation functions for real-time responsiveness to battle-field situation changes, utilizing an online reinforcement learning-based dynam-ic weight adjustment mechanism within the real-time strategy game. Building on traditional static evaluation functions, the method employs gradient descent in online reinforcement learning to update weights dynamically, incorporating weight decay techniques to ensure stability. Additionally, the AdamW optimizer is integrated to adjust the learning rate and decay rate of online reinforcement learning in real time, further reducing the dependency on manual parameter tun-ing. Round-robin competition experiments demonstrate that this method signifi-cantly enhances the application effectiveness of the Lanchester combat model evaluation function, Simple evaluation function, and Simple Sqrt evaluation function in planning algorithms including IDABCD, IDRTMinimax, and Port-folio AI. The method achieves a notable improvement in scores, with the en-hancement becoming more pronounced as the map size increases. Furthermore, the increase in evaluation function computation time induced by this method is kept below 6% for all evaluation functions and planning algorithms. The pro-posed dynamic adaptive evaluation function demonstrates a promising approach for real-time strategy task evaluation.

> Ultrasound images are commonly formed by sequential acquisition of beam-steered scan-lines. Minimizing the number of required scan-lines can significantly enhance frame rate, field of view, energy efficiency, and data transfer speeds. Existing approaches typically use static subsampling schemes in combination with sparsity-based or, more recently, deep-learning-based recovery. In this work, we introduce an adaptive subsampling method that maximizes intrinsic information gain in-situ, employing a Sylvester Normalizing Flow encoder to infer an approximate Bayesian posterior under partial observation in real-time. Using the Bayesian posterior and a deep generative model for future observations, we determine the subsampling scheme that maximizes the mutual information between the subsampled observations, and the next frame of the video. We evaluate our approach using the EchoNet cardiac ultrasound video dataset and demonstrate that our active sampling method outperforms competitive baselines, including uniform and variable-density random sampling, as well as equidistantly spaced scan-lines, improving mean absolute reconstruction error by 15%. Moreover, posterior inference and the sampling scheme generation are performed in just 0.015 seconds (66Hz), making it fast enough for real-time 2D ultrasound imaging applications.

This study explores the effects of different data selection methods and feature types on model performance. We evaluate whether selecting data subsets can influence downstream tasks, whether n-gram features improve alignment with target distributions, and whether embedding-based neural features provide complementary benefits. Through comparative experiments using baseline random selection methods and distribution aligned approaches, we provide insights into the interplay between data selection strategies and model training efficacy.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for graph representation learning in various domains, such as social media and healthcare. However, they often suffer from fairness issues due to inherent biases in node attributes and graph structure, leading to unfair predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel GNN framework, DAB-GNN, that Disentangles, Amplifies, and deBiases attribute, structure, and potential biases in the GNN mechanism. DAB-GNN employs a disentanglement and amplification module that isolates and amplifies each type of bias through specialized disentanglers, followed by a debiasing module that minimizes the distance between subgroup distributions. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that DAB-GNN significantly outperforms ten state-of-the-art competitors in terms of achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and fairness.

> Situation assessment in Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games is crucial for understanding decision-making in complex adversarial environments. However, existing methods remain limited in processing multi-dimensional feature information and temporal dependencies. Here we propose a tri-dimensional Space-Time-Feature Transformer (TSTF Transformer) architecture, which efficiently models battlefield situations through three independent but cascaded modules: spatial attention, temporal attention, and feature attention. On a dataset comprising 3,150 adversarial experiments, the 8-layer TSTF Transformer demonstrates superior performance: achieving 58.7% accuracy in the early game (~4% progress), significantly outperforming the conventional Timesformer's 41.8%; reaching 97.6% accuracy in the mid-game (~40% progress) while maintaining low performance variation (standard deviation 0.114). Meanwhile, this architecture requires fewer parameters (4.75M) compared to the baseline model (5.54M). Our study not only provides new insights into situation assessment in RTS games but also presents an innovative paradigm for Transformer-based multi-dimensional temporal modeling.

> The infrequent occurrence of overfitting in deep neural networks is perplexing: contrary to theoretical expectations, increasing model size often enhances performance in practice. But what if overfitting does occur, though restricted to specific sub-regions of the data space? In this work, we propose a novel score that captures the forgetting rate of deep models on validation data. We posit that this score quantifies local overfitting: a decline in performance confined to certain regions of the data space. We then show empirically that local overfitting occurs regardless of the presence of traditional overfitting. Using the framework of deep over-parametrized linear models, we offer a certain theoretical characterization of forgotten knowledge, and show that it correlates with knowledge forgotten by real deep models. Finally, we devise a new ensemble method that aims to recover forgotten knowledge, relying solely on the training history of a single network. When combined with self-distillation, this method enhances the performance of any trained model without adding inference costs. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method across multiple datasets, contemporary neural network architectures, and training protocols.

> Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendations, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity to the item embedding. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial scenarios. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Moreover, it has been successfully deployed in a real-world e-commerce platform, processing millions of product listings daily while supporting dynamic, large-scale attribute taxonomies.

> Brain tumors can result in neurological dysfunction, alterations in cognitive and psychological states, increased intracranial pressure, and the occurrence of seizures, thereby presenting a substantial risk to human life and health. The You Only Look Once(YOLO) series models have demonstrated superior accuracy in object detection for medical imaging. In this paper, we develop a novel SCC-YOLO architecture by integrating the SCConv attention mechanism into YOLOv9. The SCConv module reconstructs an efficient convolutional module by reducing spatial and channel redundancy among features, thereby enhancing the learning of image features. We investigate the impact of intergrating different attention mechanisms with the YOLOv9 model on brain tumor image detection using both the Br35H dataset and our self-made dataset(Brain_Tumor_Dataset). Experimental results show that on the Br35H dataset, SCC-YOLO achieved a 0.3% improvement in mAp50 compared to YOLOv9, while on our self-made dataset, SCC-YOLO exhibited a 0.5% improvement over YOLOv9.

> Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a crucial component in developing general-purpose AI agents capable of natural human-computer interaction. However, building robust multilingual SER systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data in languages other than English and Chinese. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance SER performance in low SER resource languages by leveraging data from high-resource languages. Specifically, we employ expressive Speech-to-Speech translation (S2ST) combined with a novel bootstrapping data selection pipeline to generate labeled data in the target language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and generalizable across different upstream models and languages. Our results suggest that this approach can facilitate the development of more scalable and robust multilingual SER systems.

> Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in archaeology have increased significantly in recent years, and these now span all subfields, geographical regions, and time periods. The prevalence and success of these applications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use of machine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields of archaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles published between 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number of relevant publications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection and artefact classification were the most represented tasks in the articles reviewed, followed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. From the review, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented compared to supervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning account for two thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learning is gaining in popularity it remains subject to misunderstanding. We observed, in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine learning methods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learning applications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorly expressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists to develop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their research questions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning is rapidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice, useful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not without limitations. This review highlights the importance of well-defined and well-reported structured methodologies and collaborative practices to maximise the potential of applications of machine learning methods in archaeology.

> Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. Non-invasive, cost-effective imaging techniques play a crucial role in early detection and prevention of CVD. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has gained recognition as a potential tool for early CVD risk prediction, though its use remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the potential of OCT as an additional imaging technique to predict future CVD events. We analysed retinal OCT data from the UK Biobank. The dataset included 612 patients who suffered a myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke within five years of imaging and 2,234 controls without CVD (total: 2,846 participants). A self-supervised deep learning approach based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) was used to extract low-dimensional latent representations from high-dimensional 3D OCT images, capturing distinct features of retinal layers. These latent features, along with clinical data, were used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier to differentiate between patients at risk of future CVD events (MI or stroke) and healthy controls. Our model achieved an AUC of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.70, specificity of 0.70, and accuracy of 0.70, outperforming the QRISK3 score (the third version of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk prediction algorithm; AUC = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.60, specificity = 0.55, accuracy = 0.55). The choroidal layer in OCT images was identified as a key predictor of future CVD events, revealed through a novel model explainability approach. This study demonstrates that retinal OCT imaging is a cost-effective, non-invasive alternative for predicting CVD risk, offering potential for widespread application in optometry practices and hospitals.

> As short text data in native languages like Hindi increasingly appear in modern media, robust methods for topic modeling on such data have gained importance. This study investigates the performance of BERTopic in modeling Hindi short texts, an area that has been under-explored in existing research. Using contextual embeddings, BERTopic can capture semantic relationships in data, making it potentially more effective than traditional models, especially for short and diverse texts. We evaluate BERTopic using 6 different document embedding models and compare its performance against 8 established topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Additive Regularization of Topic Models (ARTM), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Embedded Topic Model (ETM), Combined Topic Model (CTM), and Top2Vec. The models are assessed using coherence scores across a range of topic counts. Our results reveal that BERTopic consistently outperforms other models in capturing coherent topics from short Hindi texts.

> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as Sensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in handling a range of graph analytical tasks across various domains, such as e-commerce and social networks. Despite their versatility, GNNs face significant challenges in transferability, limiting their utility in real-world applications. Existing research in GNN transfer learning overlooks discrepancies in distribution among various graph datasets, facing challenges when transferring across different distributions. How to effectively adopt a well-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structural distributions remains an under-explored problem. Taking inspiration from the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in adapting large language models to various domains, we propose GraphLoRA, an effective and parameter-efficient method for transferring well-trained GNNs to diverse graph domains. Specifically, we first propose a Structure-aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy (SMMD) to align divergent node feature distributions across source and target graphs. Moreover, we introduce low-rank adaptation by injecting a small trainable GNN alongside the pre-trained one, effectively bridging structural distribution gaps while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, a structure-aware regularization objective is proposed to enhance the adaptability of the pre-trained GNN to target graph with scarce supervision labels. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphLoRA against fourteen baselines by tuning only 20% of parameters, even across disparate graph domains. The code is available at https://github.com/AllminerLab/GraphLoRA.

> Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or images. However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.

> The increasing complexity of 6G systems demands innovative tools for network management, simulation, and optimization. This work introduces the integration of ns-3 with Sionna RT, establishing the foundation for the first open source full-stack Digital Network Twin (DNT) capable of supporting multi-RAT. By incorporating a deterministic ray tracer for precise and site-specific channel modeling, this framework addresses limitations of traditional stochastic models and enables realistic, dynamic, and multilayered wireless network simulations. Tested in a challenging vehicular urban scenario, the proposed solution demonstrates significant improvements in accurately modeling wireless channels and their cascading effects on higher network layers. With up to 65% observed differences in application-layer performance compared to stochastic models, this work highlights the transformative potential of ray-traced simulations for 6G research, training, and network management.

> In this paper, we consider model order reduction (MOR) methods for problems with slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-widths as, e.g., certain wave-like or transport-dominated problems. To overcome this Kolmogorov barrier within MOR, nonlinear projections are used, which are often realized numerically using autoencoders. These autoencoders generally consist of a nonlinear encoder and a nonlinear decoder and involve costly training of the hyperparameters to obtain a good approximation quality of the reduced system. To facilitate the training process, we show that extending the to-be-reduced system and its corresponding training data makes it possible to replace the nonlinear encoder with a linear encoder without sacrificing accuracy, thus roughly halving the number of hyperparameters to be trained.

> Using an interface inserted in a background mesh is an alternative way of constructing a complex geometrical shape with a relative low meshing efforts. However, this process may require special treatment of elements cut by the interface. Our study focuses on comparing the integration of cut elements defined by implicit and parametric curves. We investigate the efficiency and robustness of open-source tools such as Algoim [5](a library for quadrature on implicitly defined geometries) and Ginkgo [2](a library for isogeometric analysis on Boolean operations with a parametric description) with numerical examples computing the area defined by the interface and benchmarks for 2D elasticity problem using the open-source code GeoPDEs [7]. It is concluded that none of the two interface descriptions is preferable with respect to the quality of the integration. Thus, the choice of the interface type depends only on the studied problem and the available curve description, but not on the numerical aspects of the integration.

> Automatic Music Transcription (AMT), aiming to get musical notes from raw audio, typically uses frame-level systems with piano-roll outputs or language model (LM)-based systems with note-level predictions. However, frame-level systems require manual thresholding, while the LM-based systems struggle with long sequences. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method combining pre-trained roll-based encoders with an LM decoder to leverage the strengths of both methods. Besides, our approach employs a hierarchical prediction strategy, first predicting onset and pitch, then velocity, and finally offset. The hierarchical prediction strategy reduces computational costs by breaking down long sequences into different hierarchies. Evaluated on two benchmark roll-based encoders, our method outperforms traditional piano-roll outputs 0.01 and 0.022 in onset-offset-velocity F1 score, demonstrating its potential as a performance-enhancing plug-in for arbitrary roll-based music transcription encoder.

> The BabyLM challenge called on participants to develop sample-efficient language models. Submissions were pretrained on a fixed English corpus, limited to the amount of words children are exposed to in development (<100m). The challenge produced new architectures for data-efficient language modelling, which outperformed models trained on trillions of words. This is promising for low-resource languages, where available corpora are limited to much less than 100m words. In this paper, we explore the potential of BabyLMs for low-resource languages, using the isiXhosa language as a case study. We pretrain two BabyLM architectures, ELC-BERT and MLSM, on an isiXhosa corpus. They outperform a vanilla pretrained model on POS tagging and NER, achieving notable gains (+3.2 F1) for the latter. In some instances, the BabyLMs even outperform XLM-R. Our findings show that data-efficient models are viable for low-resource languages, but highlight the continued importance, and lack of, high-quality pretraining data. Finally, we visually analyse how BabyLM architectures encode isiXhosa.

> Research on text simplification has primarily focused on lexical and sentence-level changes. Long document-level simplification (DS) is still relatively unexplored. Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have excelled in many natural language processing tasks. However, their performance on DS tasks is unsatisfactory, as they often treat DS as merely document summarization. For the DS task, the generated long sequences not only must maintain consistency with the original document throughout, but complete moderate simplification operations encompassing discourses, sentences, and word-level simplifications. Human editors employ a hierarchical complexity simplification strategy to simplify documents. This study delves into simulating this strategy through the utilization of a multi-stage collaboration using LLMs. We propose a progressive simplification method (ProgDS) by hierarchically decomposing the task, including the discourse-level, topic-level, and lexical-level simplification. Experimental results demonstrate that ProgDS significantly outperforms existing smaller models or direct prompting with LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art in the document simplification task.

> This work is about understanding the impact of invariance and equivariance on generalisation in supervised learning. We use the perspective afforded by an averaging operator to show that for any predictor that is not equivariant, there is an equivariant predictor with strictly lower test risk on all regression problems where the equivariance is correctly specified. This constitutes a rigorous proof that symmetry, in the form of invariance or equivariance, is a useful inductive bias.   We apply these ideas to equivariance and invariance in random design least squares and kernel ridge regression respectively. This allows us to specify the reduction in expected test risk in more concrete settings and express it in terms of properties of the group, the model and the data.   Along the way, we give examples and additional results to demonstrate the utility of the averaging operator approach in analysing equivariant predictors. In addition, we adopt an alternative perspective and formalise the common intuition that learning with invariant models reduces to a problem in terms of orbit representatives. The formalism extends naturally to a similar intuition for equivariant models. We conclude by connecting the two perspectives and giving some ideas for future work.

> Reliable slot and intent detection (SID) is crucial in natural language understanding for applications like digital assistants. Encoder-only transformer models fine-tuned on high-resource languages generally perform well on SID. However, they struggle with dialectal data, where no standardized form exists and training data is scarce and costly to produce. We explore zero-shot transfer learning for SID, focusing on multiple Bavarian dialects, for which we release a new dataset for the Munich dialect. We evaluate models trained on auxiliary tasks in Bavarian, and compare joint multi-task learning with intermediate-task training. We also compare three types of auxiliary tasks: token-level syntactic tasks, named entity recognition (NER), and language modelling. We find that the included auxiliary tasks have a more positive effect on slot filling than intent classification (with NER having the most positive effect), and that intermediate-task training yields more consistent performance gains. Our best-performing approach improves intent classification performance on Bavarian dialects by 5.1 and slot filling F1 by 8.4 percentage points.

> The contextual bandit problem, where agents arrive sequentially with personal contexts and the system adapts its arm allocation decisions accordingly, has recently garnered increasing attention for enabling more personalized outcomes. However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system. For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments. We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents. We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families.

> Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often struggle with low training efficiency. A common approach to address this challenge is integrating model-based planning algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or Value Iteration (VI), into the environmental model. However, VI requires iterating over a large tensor which updates the value of the preceding state based on the succeeding state through value propagation, resulting in computationally intensive operations. To enhance the RL training efficiency, we propose improving the efficiency of the value learning process. In deterministic environments with discrete state and action spaces, we observe that on the sampled empirical state-transition graph, a non-branching sequence of transitions-termed a highway-can take the agent to another state without deviation through intermediate states. On these non-branching highways, the value-updating process can be streamlined into a single-step operation, eliminating the need for step-by-step updates. Building on this observation, we introduce the highway graph to model state transitions. The highway graph compresses the transition model into a compact representation, where edges can encapsulate multiple state transitions, enabling value propagation across multiple time steps in a single iteration. By integrating the highway graph into RL, the training process is significantly accelerated, particularly in the early stages of training. Experiments across four categories of environments demonstrate that our method learns significantly faster than established and state-of-the-art RL algorithms (often by a factor of 10 to 150) while maintaining equal or superior expected returns. Furthermore, a deep neural network-based agent trained using the highway graph exhibits improved generalization capabilities and reduced storage costs. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/coodest/highwayRL.

> Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an influence functions framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.

> Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from psychiatric medications are the leading cause of hospitalizations among mental health patients. With healthcare systems and online communities facing limitations in resolving ADR-related issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fill this gap. Despite the increasing capabilities of LLMs, past research has not explored their capabilities in detecting ADRs related to psychiatric medications or in providing effective harm reduction strategies. To address this, we introduce the Psych-ADR benchmark and the Adverse Drug Reaction Response Assessment (ADRA) framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance in detecting ADR expressions and delivering expert-aligned mitigation strategies. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with understanding the nuances of ADRs and differentiating between types of ADRs. While LLMs align with experts in terms of expressed emotions and tone of the text, their responses are more complex, harder to read, and only 70.86% aligned with expert strategies. Furthermore, they provide less actionable advice by a margin of 12.32% on average. Our work provides a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in strategy-driven tasks within high-risk domains.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the most promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence, and the software engineering community has readily noticed their potential role in the software development life-cycle. Developers routinely ask LLMs to generate code snippets, increasing productivity but also potentially introducing ownership, privacy, correctness, and security issues. Previous work highlighted how code generated by mainstream commercial LLMs is often not safe, containing vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells. In this paper, we present a framework that leverages testing and static analysis to assess the quality, and guide the self-improvement, of code generated by general-purpose, open-source LLMs.   First, we ask LLMs to generate C code to solve a number of programming tasks. Then we employ ground-truth tests to assess the (in)correctness of the generated code, and a static analysis tool to detect potential safety vulnerabilities. Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generated code, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the models ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced during the static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback.   Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the generated code can include safety issues. Moreover, they perform very poorly at detecting either issue. On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability to fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or potential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the safety of LLM-based code generation tools.

The corpus comes from field recordings, most of which are noisy, for which only 5 hrs have matching transcriptions, and for which forced alignment is of variable quality. The corpus contains an additional 20 hrs of unlabelled speech. We report baseline results from state-of-the-art multilingual speech foundation models with a best phone error rate of 30.4%, using a pipeline that continues pre-training on the foundation model using the unlabelled set.

> Slot and intent detection (SID) is a classic natural language understanding task. Despite this, research has only more recently begun focusing on SID for dialectal and colloquial varieties. Many approaches for low-resource scenarios have not yet been applied to dialectal SID data, or compared to each other on the same datasets. We participate in the VarDial 2025 shared task on slot and intent detection in Norwegian varieties, and compare multiple set-ups: varying the training data (English, Norwegian, or dialectal Norwegian), injecting character-level noise, training on auxiliary tasks, and applying Layer Swapping, a technique in which layers of models fine-tuned on different datasets are assembled into a model. We find noise injection to be beneficial while the effects of auxiliary tasks are mixed. Though some experimentation was required to successfully assemble a model from layers, it worked surprisingly well; a combination of models trained on English and small amounts of dialectal data produced the most robust slot predictions. Our best models achieve 97.6% intent accuracy and 85.6% slot F1 in the shared task.

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.

> Audio restoration has become increasingly significant in modern society, not only due to the demand for high-quality auditory experiences enabled by advanced playback devices, but also because the growing capabilities of generative audio models necessitate high-fidelity audio. Typically, audio restoration is defined as a task of predicting undistorted audio from damaged input, often trained using a GAN framework to balance perception and distortion. Since audio degradation is primarily concentrated in mid- and high-frequency ranges, especially due to codecs, a key challenge lies in designing a generator capable of preserving low-frequency information while accurately reconstructing high-quality mid- and high-frequency content. Inspired by recent advancements in high-sample-rate music separation, speech enhancement, and audio codec models, we propose Apollo, a generative model designed for high-sample-rate audio restoration. Apollo employs an explicit frequency band split module to model the relationships between different frequency bands, allowing for more coherent and higher-quality restored audio. Evaluated on the MUSDB18-HQ and MoisesDB datasets, Apollo consistently outperforms existing SR-GAN models across various bit rates and music genres, particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving mixtures of multiple instruments and vocals. Apollo significantly improves music restoration quality while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code for Apollo is publicly available at https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo.

> Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.

> We consider the problem of the best arm identification in the presence of stochastic constraints, where there is a finite number of arms associated with multiple performance measures. The goal is to identify the arm that optimizes the objective measure subject to constraints on the remaining measures. We will explore the popular idea of Thompson sampling (TS) as a means to solve it. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to extend TS to this problem. We will design a TS-based sampling algorithm, establish its asymptotic optimality in the rate of posterior convergence, and demonstrate its superior performance using numerical examples.

> Recent research has demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) are not limited to text-only tasks but can also function as multimodal models across various modalities, including audio, images, and videos. In particular, research on 3D Large Multimodal Models (3D LMMs) is making notable strides, driven by the potential of processing higher-dimensional data like point clouds. However, upon closer examination, we find that the visual and textual content within each sample of existing training datasets lacks both high informational granularity and clarity, which serve as a bottleneck for precise cross-modal understanding. To address these issues, we propose CL3DOR, Contrastive Learning for 3D large multimodal models via Odds ratio on high-Resolution point clouds, designed to ensure greater specificity and clarity in both visual and textual content. Specifically, we increase the density of point clouds per object and construct informative hard negative responses in the training dataset to penalize unwanted responses. To leverage hard negative responses, we incorporate the odds ratio as an auxiliary term for contrastive learning into the conventional language modeling loss. CL3DOR achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D scene understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CL3DOR's key components through extensive experiments.

> Recent innovations in light sheet microscopy, paired with developments in tissue clearing techniques, enable the 3D imaging of large mammalian tissues with cellular resolution. Combined with the progress in large-scale data analysis, driven by deep learning, these innovations empower researchers to rapidly investigate the morphological and functional properties of diverse biological samples. Segmentation, a crucial preliminary step in the analysis process, can be automated using domain-specific deep learning models with expert-level performance. However, these models exhibit high sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a significant drop in accuracy when applied to data outside their training distribution. To address this limitation, and inspired by the recent success of self-supervised learning in training generalizable models, we organized the SELMA3D Challenge during the MICCAI 2024 conference. SELMA3D provides a vast collection of light-sheet images from cleared mice and human brains, comprising 35 large 3D images-each with over 1000^3 voxels-and 315 annotated small patches for finetuning, preliminary testing and final testing. The dataset encompasses diverse biological structures, including vessel-like and spot-like structures. Five teams participated in all phases of the challenge, and their proposed methods are reviewed in this paper. Quantitative and qualitative results from most participating teams demonstrate that self-supervised learning on large datasets improves segmentation model performance and generalization. We will continue to support and extend SELMA3D as an inaugural MICCAI challenge focused on self-supervised learning for 3D microscopy image segmentation.

> Self-driving cars require extensive testing, which can be costly in terms of time. To optimize this process, simple and straightforward tests should be excluded, focusing on challenging tests instead. This study addresses the test selection problem for lane-keeping systems for self-driving cars. Road segment features, such as angles and lengths, were extracted and treated as sequences, enabling classification of the test cases as "safe" or "unsafe" using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The proposed model is compared against machine learning-based test selectors. Results demonstrated that the LSTM-based method outperformed machine learning-based methods in accuracy and precision metrics while exhibiting comparable performance in recall and F1 scores. This work introduces a novel deep learning-based approach to the road classification problem, providing an effective solution for self-driving car test selection using a simulation environment.

> The purpose of this study was to accelerate MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) acquisitions using deep learning-based (DL) reconstruction at 3T and 0.55T. A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold accelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DL reconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) and self-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques, parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. We also tested DL reconstructions with prospectively accelerated acquisitions and evaluated their robustness when changing fields strengths from 3T to 0.55T. DL reconstructions demonstrated a reduction in average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher than those of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the image quality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-quality reconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highly accelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisitions.

> Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have made huge strides toward the effective alignment of large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and reflect human values. More recently, Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) have emerged in which the reward modeling stage of RLHF is skipped by characterizing the reward directly as a function of the policy being learned. Examples include Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO). These methods often suffer from likelihood displacement, a phenomenon by which the probabilities of preferred responses are often reduced undesirably.   In this paper, we argue that, for DAAs the reward (function) shape matters. We introduce AlphaPO, a new DAA method that leverages an $\alpha$-parameter to help change the shape of the reward function beyond the standard log reward. AlphaPO helps maintain fine-grained control over likelihood displacement and over-optimization. Compared to SimPO, one of the best performing DAAs, AlphaPO leads to about 7\% to 10\% relative improvement in alignment performance for the instruct versions of Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B. The analysis and results presented highlight the importance of the reward shape, and how one can systematically change it to affect training dynamics, as well as improve alignment performance.

> The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads has led to a significant increase in silicon area dedicated to lower-precision computations on recent high-performance computing hardware designs. However, mixed-precision capabilities, which can achieve performance improvements of 8x compared to double-precision in extreme compute-intensive workloads, remain largely untapped in most scientific applications. A growing number of efforts have shown that mixed-precision algorithmic innovations can deliver superior performance without sacrificing accuracy. These developments should prompt computational scientists to seriously consider whether their scientific modeling and simulation applications could benefit from the acceleration offered by new hardware and mixed-precision algorithms. In this article, we review the literature on relevant applications, existing mixed-precision algorithms, theories, and the available software infrastructure. We then offer our perspective and recommendations on the potential of mixed-precision algorithms to enhance the performance of scientific simulation applications. Broadly, we find that mixed-precision methods can have a large impact on computational science in terms of time-to-solution and energy consumption. This is true not only for a few arithmetic-dominated applications but also, to a more moderate extent, to the many memory bandwidth-bound applications. In many cases, though, the choice of algorithms and regions of applicability will be domain-specific, and thus require input from domain experts. It is helpful to identify cross-cutting computational motifs and their mixed-precision algorithms in this regard. Finally, there are new algorithms being developed to utilize AI hardware and and AI methods to accelerate first-principles computational science, and these should be closely watched as hardware platforms evolve.

> The development of the DRL model for malware attribution involved extensive research, iterative coding, and numerous adjustments based on the insights gathered from predecessor models and contemporary research papers. This preparatory work was essential to establish a robust foundation for the model, ensuring it could adapt and respond effectively to the dynamic nature of malware threats. Initially, the model struggled with low accuracy levels, but through persistent adjustments to its architecture and learning algorithms, accuracy improved dramatically from about 7 percent to over 73 percent in early iterations. By the end of the training, the model consistently reached accuracy levels near 98 percent, demonstrating its strong capability to accurately recognise and attribute malware activities. This upward trajectory in training accuracy is graphically represented in the Figure, which vividly illustrates the model maturation and increasing proficiency over time.

> Although deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be effective, the model's black-box nature presents barriers to direct policy interpretation. To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.

> In time-series analysis, many recent works seek to provide a unified view and representation for time-series across multiple domains, leading to the development of foundation models for time-series data. Despite diverse modeling techniques, existing models are black boxes and fail to provide insights and explanations about their representations. In this paper, we present VQShape, a pre-trained, generalizable, and interpretable model for time-series representation learning and classification. By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models. Additionally, in zero-shot learning, VQShape and its codebook can generalize to previously unseen datasets and domains that are not included in the pre-training process. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/YunshiWen/VQShape.

> Recent advances in SSL enabled novel medical AI models, known as foundation models, offer great potential for better characterizing health from diverse biomedical data. CGM provides rich, temporal data on glycemic patterns, but its full potential for predicting broader health outcomes remains underutilized. Here, we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model for CGM data that learns nuanced glycemic patterns and translates them into predictive representations of metabolic health. Trained on over 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 adults, primarily without diabetes, GluFormer uses autoregressive token prediction to capture longitudinal glucose dynamics. We show that GluFormer generalizes to 19 external cohorts (n=6,044) spanning different ethnicities and ages, 5 countries, 8 CGM devices, and diverse pathophysiological states. GluFormers representations exceed the performance of current CGM metrics, such as the Glucose Management Indicator (GMI), for forecasting clinical measures. In a longitudinal study of 580 adults with CGM data and 12-year follow-up, GluFormer identifies individuals at elevated risk of developing diabetes more effectively than blood HbA1C%, capturing 66% of all new-onset diabetes diagnoses in the top quartile versus 7% in the bottom quartile. Similarly, 69% of cardiovascular-death events occurred in the top quartile with none in the bottom quartile, demonstrating powerful risk stratification beyond traditional glycemic metrics. We also show that CGM representations from pre-intervention periods in Randomized Clinical Trials outperform other methods in predicting primary and secondary outcomes. When integrating dietary data into GluFormer, we show that the multi-modal version of the model can accurately generate CGM data based on dietary intake data, simulate outcomes of dietary interventions, and predict individual responses to specific foods.

> The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.

> Recent advances in instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have imbued the models with the ability to generate high-level, image-grounded explanations with ease. While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs like LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate an accurate explanation with detailed attributes based on the concept that appears within an input image despite their capability to generate holistic image-level descriptions. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs exhibit modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept, preventing the image modality from leveraging the rich parametric knowledge within the LLMs. In an effort to further the community's endeavor in this direction, we propose a multiple granularity attribute-centric evaluation benchmark, Finer, which aims to establish a ground to evaluate LVLMs' fine-grained visual comprehension ability and provide significantly improved explainability.

> Operator learning, the approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using ideas from machine learning, has gained increasing research attention in recent years. Approximate operators, learned from data, hold promise to serve as efficient surrogate models for problems in computational science and engineering, complementing traditional numerical methods. However, despite their empirical success, our understanding of the underpinning mathematical theory is in large part still incomplete. In this paper, we study the approximation of Lipschitz operators in expectation with respect to Gaussian measures. We prove higher Gaussian Sobolev regularity of Lipschitz operators and establish lower and upper bounds on the Hermite polynomial approximation error. We further consider the reconstruction of Lipschitz operators from $m$ arbitrary (adaptive) linear samples. A key finding is the tight characterization of the smallest achievable error for all possible (adaptive) sampling and reconstruction maps in terms of $m$. It is shown that Hermite polynomial approximation is an optimal recovery strategy, but we have the following curse of sample complexity: No method to approximate Lipschitz operators based on $m$ samples can achieve algebraic convergence rates in $m$. On the positive side, we prove that a sufficiently fast spectral decay of the covariance operator of the Gaussian measure guarantees convergence rates which are arbitrarily close to any algebraic rate in the large data limit $m \to \infty$. A main focus of this work is on the recovery of Lipschitz operators from finitely many point samples. We use Christoffel sampling and weighted least-squares approximation to propose an algorithm which provably achieves near-optimal sample complexity in high probability.

> We investigate the explainability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies from a temporal perspective, focusing on the sequence of future outcomes associated with individual actions. In RL, value functions compress information about rewards collected across multiple trajectories and over an infinite horizon, allowing a compact form of knowledge representation. However, this compression obscures the temporal details inherent in sequential decision-making, presenting a key challenge for interpretability. We present Temporal Policy Decomposition (TPD), a novel explainability approach that explains individual RL actions in terms of their Expected Future Outcome (EFO). These explanations decompose generalized value functions into a sequence of EFOs, one for each time step up to a prediction horizon of interest, revealing insights into when specific outcomes are expected to occur. We leverage fixed-horizon temporal difference learning to devise an off-policy method for learning EFOs for both optimal and suboptimal actions, enabling contrastive explanations consisting of EFOs for different state-action pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that TPD generates accurate explanations that (i) clarify the policy's future strategy and anticipated trajectory for a given action and (ii) improve understanding of the reward composition, facilitating fine-tuning of the reward function to align with human expectations.

> Koopman operator theory has found significant success in learning models of complex, real-world dynamical systems, enabling prediction and control. The greater interpretability and lower computational costs of these models, compared to traditional machine learning methodologies, make Koopman learning an especially appealing approach. Despite this, little work has been performed on endowing Koopman learning with the ability to leverage its own failures. To address this, we equip Koopman methods -- developed for predicting non-autonomous time-series -- with an episodic memory mechanism, enabling global recall of (or attention to) periods in time where similar dynamics previously occurred. We find that a basic implementation of Koopman learning with episodic memory leads to significant improvements in prediction on synthetic and real-world data. Our framework has considerable potential for expansion, allowing for future advances, and opens exciting new directions for Koopman learning.

This paper aims to develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture for medical question answering pertaining to clinicians' queries on emerging issues associated with health-related topics, using user-generated medical information on social media. We proposed a two-layer RAG framework for query-focused answer generation and evaluated a proof of concept for the framework in the context of query-focused summary generation from social media forums, focusing on emerging drug-related information. Our modular framework generates individual summaries followed by an aggregated summary to answer medical queries from large amounts of user-generated social media data in an efficient manner. We compared the performance of a quantized large language model (Nous-Hermes-2-7B-DPO), deployable in low-resource settings, with GPT-4. For this proof-of-concept study, we used user-generated data from Reddit to answer clinicians' questions on the use of xylazine and ketamine. Our framework achieves comparable median scores in terms of relevance, length, hallucination, coverage, and coherence when evaluated using GPT-4 and Nous-Hermes-2-7B-DPO, evaluated for 20 queries with 76 samples. There was no statistically significant difference between the two for coverage, coherence, relevance, length, and hallucination. A statistically significant difference was noted for the Coleman-Liau Index. Our RAG framework can effectively answer medical questions about targeted topics and can be deployed in resource-constrained settings.

- `2412.06866v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06866v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06866v3)

> Time series forecasting is an important challenge with significant applications in areas such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, scientific simulations and industrial process analysis. In this work, we introduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture that incorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating at multiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal components, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing on low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass filtering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowing the model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal components directly in the frequency domain. A key innovation in our approach is the integration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences in time steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time more effectively. Each encoder processes the input through fully connected layers to handle temporal and channel interactions. By combining frequency-domain filtering, autocorrelation-based temporal modeling, and channel-wise transformations, LMS-AutoTSF not only accurately captures long-term dependencies and fine-grained patterns but also operates more efficiently compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design ensures faster processing while maintaining high precision in forecasting across diverse time horizons.

> The integration of large language models (LLMs) into public transit systems presents a transformative opportunity to enhance urban mobility. This study explores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize public transportation management within the context of San Antonio's transit system. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing and data analysis, we investigate their capabilities to optimize route planning, reduce wait times, and provide personalized travel assistance. By utilizing the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and other relevant data, this research aims to demonstrate how LLMs can potentially improve resource allocation, elevate passenger satisfaction, and inform data-driven decision-making in transit operations. A comparative analysis of different ChatGPT models was conducted to assess their ability to understand transportation information, retrieve relevant data, and provide comprehensive responses. Findings from this study suggest that while LLMs hold immense promise for public transit, careful engineering and fine-tuning are essential to realizing their full potential. San Antonio serves as a case study to inform the development of LLM-powered transit systems in other urban environments.

> Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models outperform conventional models by selectively activating different subnets, named \emph{experts}, on a per-token basis. This gated computation generates dynamic communications that cannot be determined beforehand, challenging the existing GPU interconnects that remain \emph{static} during the distributed training process. In this paper, we advocate for a first-of-its-kind system, called mFabric, that unlocks topology reconfiguration \emph{during} distributed MoE training. Towards this vision, we first perform a production measurement study and show that the MoE dynamic communication pattern has \emph{strong locality}, alleviating the requirement of global reconfiguration. Based on this, we design and implement a \emph{regionally reconfigurable high-bandwidth domain} on top of existing electrical interconnects using optical circuit switching (OCS), achieving scalability while maintaining rapid adaptability. We have built a fully functional mFabric prototype with commodity hardware and a customized collective communication runtime that trains state-of-the-art MoE models with \emph{in-training} topology reconfiguration across 32 A100 GPUs. Large-scale packet-level simulations show that mFabric delivers comparable performance as the non-blocking fat-tree fabric while boosting the training cost efficiency (e.g., performance per dollar) of four representative MoE models by 1.2$\times$--1.5$\times$ and 1.9$\times$--2.3$\times$ at 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps link bandwidths, respectively.

> Tokenizers are crucial for encoding information in Large Language Models, but their development has recently stagnated, and they contain inherent weaknesses. Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers. Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages.   To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus. T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers. In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. Further, T-FREE shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning.

> The scientific research paradigm is undergoing a profound transformation owing to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent works demonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improve research efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, and fostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal (i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we propose Dolphin, the first closed-loop open-ended auto-research framework to further build the entire process of human scientific research. Dolphin can generate research ideas, perform experiments, and get feedback from experimental results to generate higher-quality ideas. More specifically, Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on relevant papers which are ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then, the codes are automatically generated and debugged with the exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of different topics and results show that Dolphin can generate novel ideas continuously and complete the experiment in a loop. We highlight that Dolphin can automatically propose methods that are comparable to the state-of-the-art in some tasks such as 2D image classification and 3D point classification.

> The increasing demand for privacy-preserving machine learning has spurred interest in federated unlearning, which enables the selective removal of data from models trained in federated systems. However, developing federated unlearning methods presents challenges, particularly in balancing three often conflicting objectives: privacy, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of existing federated unlearning approaches, examining their algorithmic efficiency, impact on model accuracy, and effectiveness in preserving privacy. We discuss key trade-offs among these dimensions and highlight their implications for practical applications across various domains. Additionally, we propose the OpenFederatedUnlearning framework, a unified benchmark for evaluating federated unlearning methods, incorporating classic baselines and diverse performance metrics. Our findings aim to guide practitioners in navigating the complex interplay of these objectives, offering insights to achieve effective and efficient federated unlearning. Finally, we outline directions for future research to further advance the state of federated unlearning techniques.

> Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are complex and lack effective treatment due to their poorly understood mechanism. The increasingly used data analysis from Single nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq) allows to explore transcriptomic events at a single cell level, yet face challenges in interpreting the mechanisms underlying a disease. On the other hand, Neural Network (NN) models can handle complex data to offer insights but can be seen as black boxes with poor interpretability. In this context, explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a solution that could help to understand disease-associated mechanisms when combined with efficient NN models. However, limited research explores XAI in single-cell data. In this work, we implement a method for identifying disease-related genes and the mechanistic explanation of disease progression based on NN model combined with SHAP. We analyze available Huntington's disease (HD) data to identify both HD-altered genes and mechanisms by adding Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing two methods, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and NN combined with SHAP approach. Our results show that DGE and SHAP approaches offer both common and differential sets of altered genes and pathways, reinforcing the usefulness of XAI methods for a broader perspective of disease.

> This study advances the field of conflict forecasting by using text-based actor embeddings with transformer models to predict dynamic changes in violent conflict patterns at the actor level. More specifically, we combine newswire texts with structured conflict event data and leverage recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast escalations and de-escalations among conflicting actors, such as governments, militias, separatist movements, and terrorists. This new approach accurately and promptly captures the inherently volatile patterns of violent conflicts, which existing methods have not been able to achieve. To create this framework, we began by curating and annotating a vast international newswire corpus, leveraging hand-labeled event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. By using this hybrid dataset, our models can incorporate the textual context of news sources along with the precision and detail of structured event data. This combination enables us to make both dynamic and granular predictions about conflict developments. We validate our approach through rigorous back-testing against historical events, demonstrating superior out-of-sample predictive power. We find that our approach is quite effective in identifying and predicting phases of conflict escalation and de-escalation, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models. By focusing on actor interactions, our explicit goal is to provide actionable insights to policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and peacekeeping operations in order to enable targeted and effective intervention strategies.

> Backgrounds: Information extraction (IE) is critical in clinical natural language processing (NLP). While large language models (LLMs) excel on generative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated. Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples, MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical entities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 against BERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational resources, and throughput to BERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest improvements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited training data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BERT by 7% (F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE package featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperform BERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that choosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE applications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance metrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and the intended use case scenarios.

> Automatically generating presentations from documents is a challenging task that requires balancing content quality, visual design, and structural coherence. Existing methods primarily focus on improving and evaluating the content quality in isolation, often overlooking visual design and structural coherence, which limits their practical applicability. To address these limitations, we propose PPTAgent, which comprehensively improves presentation generation through a two-stage, edit-based approach inspired by human workflows. PPTAgent first analyzes reference presentations to understand their structural patterns and content schemas, then drafts outlines and generates slides through code actions to ensure consistency and alignment. To comprehensively evaluate the quality of generated presentations, we further introduce PPTEval, an evaluation framework that assesses presentations across three dimensions: Content, Design, and Coherence. Experiments show that PPTAgent significantly outperforms traditional automatic presentation generation methods across all three dimensions. The code and data are available at https://github.com/icip-cas/PPTAgent.

We derive a tight asymptotic characterization of low-dimensional projections of the distribution of samples generated by the learned model, ascertaining in particular its dependence on the number of training samples. Building on this analysis, we discuss how mode collapse can arise, and lead to model collapse when the generative model is re-trained on generated synthetic data.

> Trained LLMs are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are zero, raising questions on efficiency. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, we compare theoretical and empirical estimates for training loss to obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of unique sequences in a natural training corpus as a function of its size. Our result implies (1) to double the number of skills represented in a training corpus, the corpus must scale more than four fold (2) for efficient LLMs, the number of parameters N and the size D of a natural training corpus scale as $N \propto D^{0.44}$; (3) if the number of parameters of an LLM is smaller than the number of unique sequences in the training corpus, scaling up can uncover emergent skills.

> The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

> We introduce a novel approach to text classification by combining doc2vec embeddings with advanced clustering techniques to improve the analysis of specialized, high-dimensional textual data. We integrate unsupervised methods such as Louvain, K-means, and Spectral clustering with doc2vec to enhance the detection of semantic patterns across a large corpus. As a case study, we apply this methodology to cybersecurity risk analysis using the MITRE ATT\&CK framework to structure and reduce the dimensionality of cyberattack tactics. Louvain clustering proved the most effective among the tested methods, achieving the best balance between cluster coherence and computational efficiency. Our approach identifies four "super tactics," demonstrating how clustering improves thematic coherence and risk attribution. The results validate the utility of combining doc2vec with clustering, particularly Louvain, for enhancing topic modeling and text classification.

However, while there is a multitude of new privacy metrics being published every day, there currently is no standardization. In this paper, we review the pros and cons of popular metrics that include simulations of adversarial attacks. We also review current best practices for amending generative models to enhance the privacy of the data they create (e.g. differential privacy).

> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are unsupervised learning methods for training a generator distribution to produce samples that approximate those drawn from a target distribution. Many such methods can be formulated as minimization of a metric or divergence between probability distributions. Recent works have derived statistical error bounds for GANs that are based on integral probability metrics (IPMs), e.g., WGAN which is based on the 1-Wasserstein metric. In general, IPMs are defined by optimizing a linear functional (difference of expectations) over a space of discriminators. A much larger class of GANs, which we here call $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs, can be constructed using $f$-divergences (e.g., Jensen-Shannon, KL, or $\alpha$-divergences) together with a regularizing discriminator space $\Gamma$ (e.g., $1$-Lipschitz functions). These GANs have nonlinear objective functions, depending on the choice of $f$, and have been shown to exhibit improved performance in a number of applications. In this work we derive statistical error bounds for $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs for general classes of $f$ and $\Gamma$ in the form of finite-sample concentration inequalities. These results prove the statistical consistency of $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs and reduce to the known results for IPM-GANs in the appropriate limit. Finally, our results also give new insight into the performance of GANs for distributions with unbounded support.

> Today, there is no clear legal test for regulating the use of variables that proxy for race and other protected classes and classifications. This Article develops such a test. Decision tools that use proxies are narrowly tailored when they exhibit the weakest total proxy power. The test is necessarily comparative. Thus, if two algorithms predict loan repayment or university academic performance with identical accuracy rates, but one uses zip code and the other does not, then the second algorithm can be said to have deployed a more equitable means for achieving the same result as the first algorithm. Scenarios in which two algorithms produce comparable and non-identical results present a greater challenge. This Article suggests that lawmakers can develop caps to permissible proxy power over time, as courts and algorithm builders learn more about the power of variables. Finally, the Article considers who should bear the burden of producing less discriminatory alternatives and suggests plaintiffs remain in the best position to keep defendants honest - so long as testing data is made available.

> Semi-supervised learning (SSL) assumes that neighbor points lie in the same category (neighbor assumption), and points in different clusters belong to various categories (cluster assumption). Existing methods usually rely on similarity measures to retrieve the similar neighbor points, ignoring cluster assumption, which may not utilize unlabeled information sufficiently and effectively. This paper first provides a systematical investigation into the significant role of probability density in SSL and lays a solid theoretical foundation for cluster assumption. To this end, we introduce a Probability-Density-Aware Measure (PM) to discern the similarity between neighbor points. To further improve Label Propagation, we also design a Probability-Density-Aware Measure Label Propagation (PMLP) algorithm to fully consider the cluster assumption in label propagation. Last but not least, we prove that traditional pseudo-labeling could be viewed as a particular case of PMLP, which provides a comprehensive theoretical understanding of PMLP's superior performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMLP achieves outstanding performance compared with other recent methods.

> Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions. This limits their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors. In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation. The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages. Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight multilingual LLMs.

> Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.

> We consider the problem of \textit{online sparse linear approximation}, where one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.

> We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks to $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible and compositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averaging techniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide a novel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also. Beyond this, our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing complex problems in machine learning in a conceptually clear yet mathematically precise way.

> This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.

> Variational Autoencoders for multimodal data hold promise for many tasks in data analysis, such as representation learning, conditional generation, and imputation. Current architectures either share the encoder output, decoder input, or both across modalities to learn a shared representation. Such architectures impose hard constraints on the model. In this work, we show that a better latent representation can be obtained by replacing these hard constraints with a soft constraint. We propose a new mixture-of-experts prior, softly guiding each modality's latent representation towards a shared aggregate posterior. This approach results in a superior latent representation and allows each encoding to preserve information better from its uncompressed original features. In extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and two challenging real-world datasets, we show improved learned latent representations and imputation of missing data modalities compared to existing methods.

> Wind gusts, being inherently stochastic, can significantly influence the safety and performance of aircraft. This study investigates a three-dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ) problem to explore how uncertainties in gust and flight conditions affect the structural response of a Lift-Plus-Cruise eVTOL aircraft wing. The analysis employs an unsteady aeroelastic model with a one-way coupling between a panel method aerodynamic solver and a shell analysis structural solver to predict the wing's response under varying conditions. Additionally, this paper presents a comparative evaluation of commonly used non-intrusive UQ methods, including non-intrusive polynomial chaos, kriging, Monte Carlo, univariate dimension reduction, and gradient-enhanced univariate dimension reduction. These methods are assessed based on their effectiveness in estimating various risk measures-mean, standard deviation, and 95th percentile-of critical structural response outputs such as maximum tip displacement and average strain energy. The numerical results reveal significant variability in the structural response outputs, even under relatively small ranges of uncertain inputs. This highlights the sensitivity of the system to uncertainties in gust and flight conditions. Furthermore, the performance of the implemented UQ methods varies significantly depending on the specific risk measures and the quantity of interest being analyzed.

> The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Behavior Trees (BTs) has recently gained attention in the robotics community, yet remains in its early stages of development. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interactively generate and edit BTs that address visual conditions, enabling context-aware robot operations in visually complex environments. A key feature of our approach lies in the conditional control through self-prompted visual conditions. Specifically, the VLM generates BTs with visual condition nodes, where conditions are expressed as free-form text. Another VLM process integrates the text into its prompt and evaluates the conditions against real-world images during robot execution. We validated our framework in a real-world cafe scenario, demonstrating both its feasibility and limitations.

> Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there have not been many theoretically-sound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity.

> To improve the cognitive autonomy of humanoid robots, this research proposes a multi-scenario reasoning architecture to solve the technical shortcomings of multi-modal understanding in this field. It draws on simulation based experimental design that adopts multi-modal synthesis (visual, auditory, tactile) and builds a simulator "Maha" to perform the experiment. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture in multimodal data. It provides reference experience for the exploration of cross-modal interaction strategies for humanoid robots in dynamic environments. In addition, multi-scenario reasoning simulates the high-level reasoning mechanism of the human brain to humanoid robots at the cognitive level. This new concept promotes cross-scenario practical task transfer and semantic-driven action planning. It heralds the future development of self-learning and autonomous behavior of humanoid robots in changing scenarios.

> Videoconferencing is now a frequent mode of communication in both professional and informal settings, yet it often lacks the fluidity and enjoyment of in-person conversation. This study leverages multimodal machine learning to predict moments of negative experience in videoconferencing. We sampled thousands of short clips from the RoomReader corpus, extracting audio embeddings, facial actions, and body motion features to train models for identifying low conversational fluidity, low enjoyment, and classifying conversational events (backchanneling, interruption, or gap). Our best models achieved an ROC-AUC of up to 0.87 on hold-out videoconference sessions, with domain-general audio features proving most critical. This work demonstrates that multimodal audio-video signals can effectively predict high-level subjective conversational outcomes. In addition, this is a contribution to research on videoconferencing user experience by showing that multimodal machine learning can be used to identify rare moments of negative user experience for further study or mitigation.

> Indian languages are inflectional and agglutinative and typically follow clause-free word order. The structure of sentences across most major Indian languages are similar when their dependency parse trees are considered. While some differences in the parsing structure occur due to peculiarities of a language or its preferred natural way of conveying meaning, several apparent differences are simply due to the granularity of representation of the smallest semantic unit of processing in a sentence. The semantic unit is typically a word, typographically separated by whitespaces. A single whitespace-separated word in one language may correspond to a group of words in another. Hence, grouping of words based on semantics helps unify the parsing structure of parallel sentences across languages and, in the process, morphology. In this work, we propose word grouping as a major preprocessing step for any computational or linguistic processing of sentences for Indian languages. Among Indian languages, since Hindi is one of the least agglutinative, we expect it to benefit the most from word-grouping. Hence, in this paper, we focus on Hindi to study the effects of grouping. We perform quantitative assessment of our proposal with an intrinsic method that perturbs sentences by shuffling words as well as an extrinsic evaluation that verifies the importance of word grouping for the task of Machine Translation (MT) using decomposed prompting. We also qualitatively analyze certain aspects of the syntactic structure of sentences. Our experiments and analyses show that the proposed grouping technique brings uniformity in the syntactic structures, as well as aids underlying NLP tasks.

> In the digital age, the challenge of forgetfulness has emerged as a significant concern, particularly regarding the management of personal data and its accessibility online. The right to be forgotten (RTBF) allows individuals to request the removal of outdated or harmful information from public access, yet implementing this right poses substantial technical difficulties for search engines. This paper aims to introduce non-experts to the foundational concepts of information retrieval (IR) and de-indexing, which are critical for understanding how search engines can effectively "forget" certain content. We will explore various IR models, including boolean, probabilistic, vector space, and embedding-based approaches, as well as the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing data processing capabilities. By providing this overview, we seek to highlight the complexities involved in balancing individual privacy rights with the operational challenges faced by search engines in managing information visibility.

> Calibration, the alignment between model confidence and prediction accuracy, is critical for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstrate robust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs' internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen the understanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting their reliable deployment in diverse applications.

> Advances in medical imaging technologies have enabled the collection of longitudinal images, which involve repeated scanning of the same patients over time, to monitor disease progression. However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/ImageFlowNet.

> The all pairs shortest path problem is a fundamental optimization problem in graph theory. We deal with re-calculating the all-pairs shortest path (APSP) matrix after a minor modification of a weighted dense graph, e.g., adding a node, removing a node, or updating an edge. We assume the APSP matrix for the original graph is already known. The graph can be directed or undirected. A cold-start calculation of the new APSP matrix by traditional algorithms, like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm, needs $ O(n^3) $ time. We propose two algorithms for warm-start calculation of the new APSP matrix. The best case complexity for a warm-start calculation is $ O(n^2) $, the worst case complexity is $ O(n^3) $. We implemented the algorithms and tested their performance with experiments. The result shows a warm-start calculation can save a great portion of calculation time, compared with cold-start calculation. In addition, another algorithm is devised to warm-start calculate of the shortest path between two nodes. Experiment shows warm-start calculation can save 99\% of calculation time, compared with cold-start calculation by Dijkstra's algorithm, on directed complete graphs of large sizes.

> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) by using external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations. However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.

> Aiming for more effective experiment design, such as in video content advertising where different content options compete for user engagement, these scenarios can be modeled as multi-arm bandit problems. In cases where limited interactions are available due to external factors, such as the cost of conducting experiments, recommenders often face constraints due to the small number of user interactions. In addition, there is a trade-off between selecting the best treatment and the ability to personalize and contextualize based on individual factors. A popular solution to this dilemma is the Contextual Bandit framework. It aims to maximize outcomes while incorporating personalization (contextual) factors, customizing treatments such as a user's profile to individual preferences. Despite their advantages, Contextual Bandit algorithms face challenges like measurement bias and the 'curse of dimensionality.' These issues complicate the management of numerous interventions and often lead to data sparsity through participant segmentation. To address these problems, we introduce the Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS) algorithm. WAPTS builds on the contextual Thompson Sampling method by using a dynamic weighting parameter. This improves the allocation process for interventions and enables rapid optimization in data-sparse environments. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on different numbers of arms and effect sizes.

> Human Sensing, a field that leverages technology to monitor human activities, psycho-physiological states, and interactions with the environment, enhances our understanding of human behavior and drives the development of advanced services that improve overall quality of life. However, its reliance on detailed and often privacy-sensitive data as the basis for its machine learning (ML) models raises significant legal and ethical concerns. The recently proposed ML approach of Federated Learning (FL) promises to alleviate many of these concerns, as it is able to create accurate ML models without sending raw user data to a central server. While FL has demonstrated its usefulness across a variety of areas, such as text prediction and cyber security, its benefits in Human Sensing are under-explored, given the particular challenges in this domain. This survey conducts a comprehensive analysis of the current state-of-the-art studies on FL in Human Sensing, and proposes a taxonomy and an eight-dimensional assessment for FL approaches. Through the eight-dimensional assessment, we then evaluate whether the surveyed studies consider a specific FL-in-Human-Sensing challenge or not. Finally, based on the overall analysis, we discuss open challenges and highlight five research aspects related to FL in Human Sensing that require urgent research attention. Our work provides a comprehensive corpus of FL studies and aims to assist FL practitioners in developing and evaluating solutions that effectively address the real-world complexities of Human Sensing.

> Efficiently learning and executing long-horizon mobile manipulation (MoMa) tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings. However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.

> LiDAR data pretraining offers a promising approach to leveraging large-scale, readily available datasets for enhanced data utilization. However, existing methods predominantly focus on sparse voxel representation, overlooking the complementary attributes provided by other LiDAR representations. In this work, we propose LiMoE, a framework that integrates the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm into LiDAR data representation learning to synergistically combine multiple representations, such as range images, sparse voxels, and raw points. Our approach consists of three stages: i) Image-to-LiDAR Pretraining, which transfers prior knowledge from images to point clouds across different representations; ii) Contrastive Mixture Learning (CML), which uses MoE to adaptively activate relevant attributes from each representation and distills these mixed features into a unified 3D network; iii) Semantic Mixture Supervision (SMS), which combines semantic logits from multiple representations to boost downstream segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across 11 large-scale LiDAR datasets demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority. The code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.

> Recent advancements in vision foundation models (VFMs) have revolutionized visual perception in 2D, yet their potential for 3D scene understanding, particularly in autonomous driving applications, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach delivers significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both linear probing and fine-tuning tasks for both LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on eleven large-scale multi-modal datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating the adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.
