> We describe two methods relevant to multi-lingual machine translation systems, which can be used to port linguistic data (grammars, lexicons and transfer rules) between systems used for processing related languages. The methods are fully implemented within the Spoken Language Translator system, and were used to create versions of the system for two new language pairs using only a month of expert effort.

> The first step in most empirical work in multilingual NLP is to construct maps of the correspondence between texts and their translations ({\bf bitext maps}). The Smooth Injective Map Recognizer (SIMR) algorithm presented here is a generic pattern recognition algorithm that is particularly well-suited to mapping bitext correspondence. SIMR is faster and significantly more accurate than other algorithms in the literature. The algorithm is robust enough to use on noisy texts, such as those resulting from OCR input, and on translations that are not very literal. SIMR encapsulates its language-specific heuristics, so that it can be ported to any language pair with a minimal effort.
