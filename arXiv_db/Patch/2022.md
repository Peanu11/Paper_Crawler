- `2201.00117v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00117v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00117v1)

> With the recent explosive growth of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, guaranteeing consistent web appearance across all environments has become a significant problem. This happens simply because it is hard to keep track of the web appearance on different sizes and types of devices that render the web pages. Therefore, fixing the inconsistent appearance of web pages can be difficult, and the cost incurred can be huge, e.g., poor user experience and financial loss due to it. Recently, automated web repair techniques have been proposed to automatically resolve inconsistent web page appearance, focusing on improving usability. However, generated patches tend to disrupt the webpage's layout, rendering the repaired webpage aesthetically unpleasing, e.g., distorted images or misalignment of components.   In this paper, we propose an automated repair approach for web pages based on meta-heuristic algorithms that can assure both usability and aesthetics. The key novelty that empowers our approach is a novel fitness function that allows us to optimistically evolve buggy web pages to find the best solution that optimizes both usability and aesthetics at the same time. Empirical evaluations show that our approach is able to successfully resolve mobile-friendly problems in 94% of the evaluation subjects, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline techniques in terms of both usability and aesthetics.

<summary>2022-01-01 16:15:34 - Leaky Frontends: Security Vulnerabilities in Processor Frontends</summary>

- *Shuwen Deng, Bowen Huang, Jakub Szefer*

- `2105.12224v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12224v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12224v3)

> This paper evaluates new security threats due to the processor frontend in modern Intel processors. The root causes of the security threats are the multiple paths in the processor frontend that the micro-operations can take: through the Micro-Instruction Translation Engine (MITE), through the Decode Stream Buffer (DSB), also called the Micro-operation Cache, or through the Loop Stream Detector (LSD). Each path has its own unique timing and power signatures, which lead to the side- and covert-channel attacks presented in this work. Especially, the switching between the different paths leads to observable timing or power differences which, as this work demonstrates, could be exploited by attackers. Because of the different paths, the switching, and way the components are shared in the frontend between hardware threads, two separate threads are able to be mutually influenced and timing or power can reveal activity on the other thread. The security threats are not limited to multi-threading, and this work further demonstrates new ways for leaking execution information about SGX enclaves or a new in-domain Spectre variant in single-thread setting. Finally, this work demonstrates a new method for fingerprinting the microcode patches of the processor by analyzing the behavior of different paths in the frontend. The findings of this work highlight the security threats associated with the processor frontend and the need for deployment of defenses for the modern processor frontend.

<summary>2022-01-02 08:06:55 - Towards Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Vision Transformers</summary>

- *Zhipeng Wei, Jingjing Chen, Micah Goldblum, Zuxuan Wu, Tom Goldstein, Yu-Gang Jiang*

- `2109.04176v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04176v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04176v3)

> Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a series of computer vision tasks, yet they still suffer from adversarial examples. % crafted in a similar fashion as CNNs. In this paper, we posit that adversarial attacks on transformers should be specially tailored for their architecture, jointly considering both patches and self-attention, in order to achieve high transferability. More specifically, we introduce a dual attack framework, which contains a Pay No Attention (PNA) attack and a PatchOut attack, to improve the transferability of adversarial samples across different ViTs. We show that skipping the gradients of attention during backpropagation can generate adversarial examples with high transferability. In addition, adversarial perturbations generated by optimizing randomly sampled subsets of patches at each iteration achieve higher attack success rates than attacks using all patches. We evaluate the transferability of attacks on state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs and robustly trained CNNs. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual attack can greatly boost transferability between ViTs and from ViTs to CNNs. In addition, the proposed method can easily be combined with existing transfer methods to boost performance. Code is available at https://github.com/zhipeng-wei/PNA-PatchOut.

- *Davide Ginelli, Oliviero Riganelli, Daniela Micucci, Leonardo Mariani*

- `2201.00736v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00736v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00736v1)

> Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques typically exploit spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) to identify the program locations that should be patched, making the effectiveness of APR techniques dependent on the effectiveness of fault localization. Indeed, results show that SBFL often does not localize faults accurately, hindering the effectiveness of APR. In this paper, we propose EXCEPT, a technique that addresses the localization problem by focusing on the semantics of failures rather than on the correlation between the executed statements and the failed tests, as SBFL does. We focus on failures due to exceptions and we exploit their type and source to localize and guess the faults. Experiments with 43 exception-raising faults from the Defects4J benchmark show that EXCEPT can perform better than Ochiai and ssFix.

<summary>2022-01-03 18:53:23 - Robust Contrastive Learning Using Negative Samples with Diminished Semantics</summary>

- *Songwei Ge, Shlok Mishra, Haohan Wang, Chun-Liang Li, David Jacobs*

- `2110.14189v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14189v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14189v2)

> Unsupervised learning has recently made exceptional progress because of the development of more effective contrastive learning methods. However, CNNs are prone to depend on low-level features that humans deem non-semantic. This dependency has been conjectured to induce a lack of robustness to image perturbations or domain shift. In this paper, we show that by generating carefully designed negative samples, contrastive learning can learn more robust representations with less dependence on such features. Contrastive learning utilizes positive pairs that preserve semantic information while perturbing superficial features in the training images. Similarly, we propose to generate negative samples in a reversed way, where only the superfluous instead of the semantic features are preserved. We develop two methods, texture-based and patch-based augmentations, to generate negative samples. These samples achieve better generalization, especially under out-of-domain settings. We also analyze our method and the generated texture-based samples, showing that texture features are indispensable in classifying particular ImageNet classes and especially finer classes. We also show that model bias favors texture and shape features differently under different test settings. Our code, trained models, and ImageNet-Texture dataset can be found at https://github.com/SongweiGe/Contrastive-Learning-with-Non-Semantic-Negatives.

<summary>2022-01-04 11:12:39 - Short Range Correlation Transformer for Occluded Person Re-Identification</summary>

- *Yunbin Zhao, Songhao Zhu, Dongsheng Wang, Zhiwei Liang*

- `2201.01090v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01090v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01090v1)

> Occluded person re-identification is one of the challenging areas of computer vision, which faces problems such as inefficient feature representation and low recognition accuracy. Convolutional neural network pays more attention to the extraction of local features, therefore it is difficult to extract features of occluded pedestrians and the effect is not so satisfied. Recently, vision transformer is introduced into the field of re-identification and achieves the most advanced results by constructing the relationship of global features between patch sequences. However, the performance of vision transformer in extracting local features is inferior to that of convolutional neural network. Therefore, we design a partial feature transformer-based person re-identification framework named PFT. The proposed PFT utilizes three modules to enhance the efficiency of vision transformer. (1) Patch full dimension enhancement module. We design a learnable tensor with the same size as patch sequences, which is full-dimensional and deeply embedded in patch sequences to enrich the diversity of training samples. (2) Fusion and reconstruction module. We extract the less important part of obtained patch sequences, and fuse them with original patch sequence to reconstruct the original patch sequences. (3) Spatial Slicing Module. We slice and group patch sequences from spatial direction, which can effectively improve the short-range correlation of patch sequences. Experimental results over occluded and holistic re-identification datasets demonstrate that the proposed PFT network achieves superior performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

<summary>2022-01-04 18:09:13 - On the effectiveness of adversarial training against common corruptions</summary>

- *Klim Kireev, Maksym Andriushchenko, Nicolas Flammarion*

- `2103.02325v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02325v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02325v2)

> The literature on robustness towards common corruptions shows no consensus on whether adversarial training can improve the performance in this setting. First, we show that, when used with an appropriately selected perturbation radius, $\ell_p$ adversarial training can serve as a strong baseline against common corruptions improving both accuracy and calibration. Then we explain why adversarial training performs better than data augmentation with simple Gaussian noise which has been observed to be a meaningful baseline on common corruptions. Related to this, we identify the $\sigma$-overfitting phenomenon when Gaussian augmentation overfits to a particular standard deviation used for training which has a significant detrimental effect on common corruption accuracy. We discuss how to alleviate this problem and then how to further enhance $\ell_p$ adversarial training by introducing an efficient relaxation of adversarial training with learned perceptual image patch similarity as the distance metric. Through experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, we show that our approach does not only improve the $\ell_p$ adversarial training baseline but also has cumulative gains with data augmentation methods such as AugMix, DeepAugment, ANT, and SIN, leading to state-of-the-art performance on common corruptions.   The code of our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/adv-training-corruptions.

<summary>2022-01-05 21:37:43 - Multiple Sclerosis Lesions Segmentation using Attention-Based CNNs in FLAIR Images</summary>

- *Mehdi SadeghiBakhi, Hamidreza Pourreza, Hamidreza Mahyar*

- `2201.01832v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01832v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01832v1)

> Objective: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, and demyelinating disease that leads to lesions in the central nervous system. This disease can be tracked and diagnosed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Up to now a multitude of multimodality automatic biomedical approaches is used to segment lesions which are not beneficial for patients in terms of cost, time, and usability. The authors of the present paper propose a method employing just one modality (FLAIR image) to segment MS lesions accurately. Methods: A patch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed, inspired by 3D-ResNet and spatial-channel attention module, to segment MS lesions. The proposed method consists of three stages: (1) the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is applied to the original images and concatenated to the extracted edges in order to create 4D images; (2) the patches of size 80 * 80 * 80 * 2 are randomly selected from the 4D images; and (3) the extracted patches are passed into an attention-based CNN which is used to segment the lesions. Finally, the proposed method was compared to previous studies of the same dataset. Results: The current study evaluates the model, with a test set of ISIB challenge data. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of Dice similarity and Absolute Volume Difference while the proposed method use just one modality (FLAIR) to segment the lesions. Conclusions: The authors have introduced an automated approach to segment the lesions which is based on, at most, two modalities as an input. The proposed architecture is composed of convolution, deconvolution, and an SCA-VoxRes module as an attention module. The results show, the proposed method outperforms well compare to other methods.

<summary>2022-01-05 22:33:43 - On the Real-World Adversarial Robustness of Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Models for Autonomous Driving</summary>

- *Giulio Rossolini, Federico Nesti, Gianluca D'Amico, Saasha Nair, Alessandro Biondi, Giorgio Buttazzo*

- `2201.01850v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01850v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01850v1)

> The existence of real-world adversarial examples (commonly in the form of patches) poses a serious threat for the use of deep learning models in safety-critical computer vision tasks such as visual perception in autonomous driving. This paper presents an extensive evaluation of the robustness of semantic segmentation models when attacked with different types of adversarial patches, including digital, simulated, and physical ones. A novel loss function is proposed to improve the capabilities of attackers in inducing a misclassification of pixels. Also, a novel attack strategy is presented to improve the Expectation Over Transformation method for placing a patch in the scene. Finally, a state-of-the-art method for detecting adversarial patch is first extended to cope with semantic segmentation models, then improved to obtain real-time performance, and eventually evaluated in real-world scenarios. Experimental results reveal that, even though the adversarial effect is visible with both digital and real-world attacks, its impact is often spatially confined to areas of the image around the patch. This opens to further questions about the spatial robustness of real-time semantic segmentation models.

- *ZiCheng Zhang, CongYing Han, TianDe Guo*

- `2105.07350v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07350v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07350v2)

> Generating images from a single sample, as a newly developing branch of image synthesis, has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we formulate this problem as sampling from the conditional distribution of a single image, and propose a hierarchical framework that simplifies the learning of the intricate conditional distributions through the successive learning of the distributions about structure, semantics and texture, making the process of learning and generation comprehensible. On this basis, we design ExSinGAN composed of three cascaded GANs for learning an explainable generative model from a given image, where the cascaded GANs model the distributions about structure, semantics and texture successively. ExSinGAN is learned not only from the internal patches of the given image as the previous works did, but also from the external prior obtained by the GAN inversion technique. Benefiting from the appropriate combination of internal and external information, ExSinGAN has a more powerful capability of generation and competitive generalization ability for the image manipulation tasks compared with prior works.

<summary>2022-01-09 10:33:37 - Analyzing Thermal Buckling in Curvilinearly Stiffened Composite Plates with Arbitrary Shaped Cutouts Using Isogeometric Level Set Method</summary>

- *Balakrishnan Devarajan*

- `2104.05132v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05132v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05132v3)

> In this paper we develop a new simple and effective isogeometric analysis for modeling thermal buckling of stiffened laminated composite plates with cutouts using level sets. We employ a first order shear deformation theory to approximate the displacement field of the stiffeners and the plate. Numerical modeling with a treatment of trimmed objects, such as internal cutouts in terms of NURBS-based isogeometric analysis presents several challenges, primarily due to need for using the tensor product of the NURBS basis functions. Due to this feature, the refinement operations can only be performed globally on the domain and not locally around the cutout. The new approach can overcome the drawbacks in modeling complex geometries with multiple-patches as the level sets are used to describe the internal cutouts; while the numerical integration is used only inside the physical domain. Results of parametric studies are presented which show the influence of ply orientation, size and orientation of the cutout and the position and profile of the curvilinear stiffeners. The numerical examples show high reliability and efficiency of the present method compared with other published solutions and ABAQUS.

- `2201.03053v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03053v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03053v1)

> This paper proposes a segmentation method of infection regions in the lung from CT volumes of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 spread worldwide, causing many infected patients and deaths. CT image-based diagnosis of COVID-19 can provide quick and accurate diagnosis results. An automated segmentation method of infection regions in the lung provides a quantitative criterion for diagnosis. Previous methods employ whole 2D image or 3D volume-based processes. Infection regions have a considerable variation in their sizes. Such processes easily miss small infection regions. Patch-based process is effective for segmenting small targets. However, selecting the appropriate patch size is difficult in infection region segmentation. We utilize the scale uncertainty among various receptive field sizes of a segmentation FCN to obtain infection regions. The receptive field sizes can be defined as the patch size and the resolution of volumes where patches are clipped from. This paper proposes an infection segmentation network (ISNet) that performs patch-based segmentation and a scale uncertainty-aware prediction aggregation method that refines the segmentation result. We design ISNet to segment infection regions that have various intensity values. ISNet has multiple encoding paths to process patch volumes normalized by multiple intensity ranges. We collect prediction results generated by ISNets having various receptive field sizes. Scale uncertainty among the prediction results is extracted by the prediction aggregation method. We use an aggregation FCN to generate a refined segmentation result considering scale uncertainty among the predictions. In our experiments using 199 chest CT volumes of COVID-19 cases, the prediction aggregation method improved the dice similarity score from 47.6% to 62.1%.

- `2201.00462v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00462v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00462v2)

> Computer-aided medical image segmentation has been applied widely in diagnosis and treatment to obtain clinically useful information of shapes and volumes of target organs and tissues. In the past several years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods (e.g., U-Net) have dominated this area, but still suffered from inadequate long-range information capturing. Hence, recent work presented computer vision Transformer variants for medical image segmentation tasks and obtained promising performances. Such Transformers model long-range dependency by computing pair-wise patch relations. However, they incur prohibitive computational costs, especially on 3D medical images (e.g., CT and MRI). In this paper, we propose a new method called Dilated Transformer, which conducts self-attention for pair-wise patch relations captured alternately in local and global scopes. Inspired by dilated convolution kernels, we conduct the global self-attention in a dilated manner, enlarging receptive fields without increasing the patches involved and thus reducing computational costs. Based on this design of Dilated Transformer, we construct a U-shaped encoder-decoder hierarchical architecture called D-Former for 3D medical image segmentation. Experiments on the Synapse and ACDC datasets show that our D-Former model, trained from scratch, outperforms various competitive CNN-based or Transformer-based segmentation models at a low computational cost without time-consuming per-training process.

> 3D ultrasound (3DUS) becomes more interesting for target tracking in radiation therapy due to its capability to provide volumetric images in real-time without using ionizing radiation. It is potentially usable for tracking without using fiducials. For this, a method for learning meaningful representations would be useful to recognize anatomical structures in different time frames in representation space (r-space). In this study, 3DUS patches are reduced into a 128-dimensional r-space using conventional autoencoder, variational autoencoder and sliced-wasserstein autoencoder. In the r-space, the capability of separating different ultrasound patches as well as recognizing similar patches is investigated and compared based on a dataset of liver images. Two metrics to evaluate the tracking capability in the r-space are proposed. It is shown that ultrasound patches with different anatomical structures can be distinguished and sets of similar patches can be clustered in r-space. The results indicate that the investigated autoencoders have different levels of usability for target tracking in 3DUS.

> The maximum traveling salesman problem (Max~TSP) consists of finding a Hamiltonian cycle with the maximum total weight of the edges in a given complete weighted graph. We prove that, in the case when the edge weights are induced by a metric space of bounded doubling dimension, asymptotically optimal solutions of the problem can be found by the simple greedy patching heuristic. Taking as a start point a maximum-weight cycle cover, this heuristic iteratively patches pairs of its cycles into one minimizing the weight loss at each step.

- `2109.07150v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07150v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07150v2)

> Accurate and complete terrain maps enhance the awareness of autonomous robots and enable safe and optimal path planning. Rocks and topography often create occlusions and lead to missing elevation information in the Digital Elevation Map (DEM). Currently, these occluded areas are either fully avoided during motion planning or the missing values in the elevation map are filled-in using traditional interpolation, diffusion or patch-matching techniques. These methods cannot leverage the high-level terrain characteristics and the geometric constraints of line of sight we humans use intuitively to predict occluded areas. We introduce a self-supervised learning approach capable of training on real-world data without a need for ground-truth information to reconstruct the occluded areas in the DEMs. We accomplish this by adding artificial occlusion to the incomplete elevation maps constructed on a real robot by performing ray casting. We first evaluate a supervised learning approach on synthetic data for which we have the full ground-truth available and subsequently move to several real-world datasets. These real-world datasets were recorded during exploration of both structured and unstructured terrain with a legged robot, and additionally in a planetary scenario on Lunar analogue terrain. We state a significant improvement compared to the baseline methods both on synthetic terrain and for the real-world datasets. Our neural network is able to run in real-time on both CPU and GPU with suitable sampling rates for autonomous ground robots. We motivate the applicability of reconstructing occlusion in elevation maps with preliminary motion planning experiments.

> Previous work has shown that early resolution of issues detected by static code analyzers can prevent major costs later on. However, developers often ignore such issues for two main reasons. First, many issues should be interpreted to determine if they correspond to actual flaws in the program. Second, static analyzers often do not present the issues in a way that is actionable. To address these problems, we present Sorald: a novel system that devise metaprogramming templates to transform the abstract syntax trees of programs and suggest fixes for static analysis warnings. Thus, the burden on the developer is reduced from interpreting and fixing static issues, to inspecting and approving full fledged solutions. Sorald fixes violations of 10 rules from SonarJava, one of the most widely used static analyzers for Java. We evaluate Sorald on a dataset of 161 popular repositories on Github. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of Sorald as it fixes 65% (852/1,307) of the violations that meets the repair preconditions. Overall, our experiments show it is possible to automatically fix notable violations of the static analysis rules produced by the state-of-the-art static analyzer SonarJava.

> Contrastive learning relies on an assumption that positive pairs contain related views, e.g., patches of an image or co-occurring multimodal signals of a video, that share certain underlying information about an instance. But what if this assumption is violated? The literature suggests that contrastive learning produces suboptimal representations in the presence of noisy views, e.g., false positive pairs with no apparent shared information. In this work, we propose a new contrastive loss function that is robust against noisy views. We provide rigorous theoretical justifications by showing connections to robust symmetric losses for noisy binary classification and by establishing a new contrastive bound for mutual information maximization based on the Wasserstein distance measure. The proposed loss is completely modality-agnostic and a simple drop-in replacement for the InfoNCE loss, which makes it easy to apply to existing contrastive frameworks. We show that our approach provides consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on image, video, and graph contrastive learning benchmarks that exhibit a variety of real-world noise patterns.

- `2201.04729v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04729v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.04729v1)

> We propose a decentralised "local2global"' approach to graph representation learning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique. Our local2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into overlapping subgraphs (or "patches") and training local representations for each patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local representations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set of rigid motions that best align the local representations using information from the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing feature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained independently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronization during distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale industrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and may be stored in a distributed manner. We apply local2global on data sets of different sizes and show that our approach achieves a good trade-off between scale and accuracy on edge reconstruction and semi-supervised classification. We also consider the downstream task of anomaly detection and show how one can use local2global to highlight anomalies in cybersecurity networks.

> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), a conditional computation architecture, achieved promising performance by scaling local module (i.e. feed-forward network) of transformer. However, scaling the cross-token module (i.e. self-attention) is challenging due to the unstable training. This work proposes Sparse-MLP, an all-MLP model which applies sparsely-activated MLPs to cross-token modeling. Specifically, in each Sparse block of our all-MLP model, we apply two stages of MoE layers: one with MLP experts mixing information within channels along image patch dimension, the other with MLP experts mixing information within patches along the channel dimension. In addition, by proposing importance-score routing strategy for MoE and redesigning the image representation shape, we further improve our model's computational efficiency. Experimentally, we are more computation-efficient than Vision Transformers with comparable accuracy. Also, our models can outperform MLP-Mixer by 2.5\% on ImageNet Top-1 accuracy with fewer parameters and computational cost. On downstream tasks, i.e. Cifar10 and Cifar100, our models can still achieve better performance than baselines.

- *Roland Croft, M. Ali Babar, Li Li*

> Software Vulnerability (SV) severity assessment is a vital task for informing SV remediation and triage. Ranking of SV severity scores is often used to advise prioritization of patching efforts. However, severity assessment is a difficult and subjective manual task that relies on expertise, knowledge, and standardized reporting schemes. Consequently, different data sources that perform independent analysis may provide conflicting severity rankings. Inconsistency across these data sources affects the reliability of severity assessment data, and can consequently impact SV prioritization and fixing. In this study, we investigate severity ranking inconsistencies over the SV reporting lifecycle. Our analysis helps characterize the nature of this problem, identify correlated factors, and determine the impacts of inconsistency on downstream tasks. Our findings observe that SV severity often lacks consideration or is underestimated during initial reporting, and such SVs consequently receive lower prioritization. We identify six potential attributes that are correlated to this misjudgment, and show that inconsistency in severity reporting schemes can severely degrade the performance of downstream severity prediction by up to 77%. Our findings help raise awareness of SV severity data inconsistencies and draw attention to this data quality problem. These insights can help developers better consider SV severity data sources, and improve the reliability of consequent SV prioritization. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to provide more attention to SV severity data selection.

- *Wei Jia, Zhaojun Lu, Haichun Zhang, Zhenglin Liu, Jie Wang, Gang Qu*

- `2201.06192v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06192v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06192v1)

> Adversarial Examples (AEs) can deceive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and have received a lot of attention recently. However, majority of the research on AEs is in the digital domain and the adversarial patches are static, which is very different from many real-world DNN applications such as Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems in autonomous vehicles. In TSR systems, object detectors use DNNs to process streaming video in real time. From the view of object detectors, the traffic sign`s position and quality of the video are continuously changing, rendering the digital AEs ineffective in the physical world.   In this paper, we propose a systematic pipeline to generate robust physical AEs against real-world object detectors. Robustness is achieved in three ways. First, we simulate the in-vehicle cameras by extending the distribution of image transformations with the blur transformation and the resolution transformation. Second, we design the single and multiple bounding boxes filters to improve the efficiency of the perturbation training. Third, we consider four representative attack vectors, namely Hiding Attack, Appearance Attack, Non-Target Attack and Target Attack.   We perform a comprehensive set of experiments under a variety of environmental conditions, and considering illuminations in sunny and cloudy weather as well as at night. The experimental results show that the physical AEs generated from our pipeline are effective and robust when attacking the YOLO v5 based TSR system. The attacks have good transferability and can deceive other state-of-the-art object detectors. We launched HA and NTA on a brand-new 2021 model vehicle. Both attacks are successful in fooling the TSR system, which could be a life-threatening case for autonomous vehicles. Finally, we discuss three defense mechanisms based on image preprocessing, AEs detection, and model enhancing.

> In recent years, the Edge Computing (EC) paradigm has emerged as an enabling factor for developing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks, bridging the gap between Cloud Computing services and end-users, supporting low latency, mobility, and location awareness to delay-sensitive applications. Most solutions in EC employ machine learning (ML) methods to perform data classification and other information processing tasks on continuous and evolving data streams. Usually, such solutions have to cope with vast amounts of data that come as data streams while balancing energy consumption, latency, and the predictive performance of the algorithms. Ensemble methods achieve remarkable predictive performance when applied to evolving data streams due to the combination of several models and the possibility of selective resets. This work investigates strategies for optimizing the performance (i.e., delay, throughput) and energy consumption of bagging ensembles to classify data streams. The experimental evaluation involved six state-of-art ensemble algorithms (OzaBag, OzaBag Adaptive Size Hoeffding Tree, Online Bagging ADWIN, Leveraging Bagging, Adaptive RandomForest, and Streaming Random Patches) applying five widely used machine learning benchmark datasets with varied characteristics on three computer platforms. Such strategies can significantly reduce energy consumption in 96% of the experimental scenarios evaluated. Despite the trade-offs, it is possible to balance them to avoid significant loss in predictive performance.

> While building convolutional network-based systems, the toll it takes to train the network is something that cannot be ignored. In cases where we need to append additional capabilities to the existing model, the attention immediately goes towards retraining techniques. In this paper, I show how to leverage knowledge about the dataset to append the class faster while maintaining the speed of inference as well as the accuracies; while reducing the amount of time and data required. The method can extend a class in the existing object detection model in 1/10th of the time compared to the other existing methods. S-Extension patch not only offers faster training but also speed and ease of adaptation, as it can be appended to any existing system, given it fulfills the similarity threshold condition.

> A critical challenge of training deep learning models in the Digital Pathology (DP) domain is the high annotation cost by medical experts. One way to tackle this issue is via transfer learning from the natural image domain (NI), where the annotation cost is considerably cheaper. Cross-domain transfer learning from NI to DP is shown to be successful via class labels. One potential weakness of relying on class labels is the lack of spatial information, which can be obtained from spatial labels such as full pixel-wise segmentation labels and scribble labels. We demonstrate that scribble labels from NI domain can boost the performance of DP models on two cancer classification datasets (Patch Camelyon Breast Cancer and Colorectal Cancer dataset). Furthermore, we show that models trained with scribble labels yield the same performance boost as full pixel-wise segmentation labels despite being significantly easier and faster to collect.

> Since Bitcoin appeared in 2009, over 6,000 different cryptocurrency projects have followed. The cryptocurrency world may be the only technology where a massive number of competitors offer similar services yet claim unique benefits, including scalability, fast transactions, and security. But are these projects really offering unique features and significant enhancements over their competitors? To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis of code maintenance activities, originality and security across 592 crypto projects. We found that about half of these projects have not been updated for the last six months; over two years, about three-quarters of them disappeared, or were reported as scams or inactive. We also investigated whether 11 security vulnerabilities patched in Bitcoin were also patched in other projects. We found that about 80% of 510 C-language-based cryptocurrency projects have at least one unpatched vulnerability, and the mean time taken to fix the vulnerability is 237.8 days. Among those 510 altcoins, we found that at least 157 altcoins are likely to have been forked from Bitcoin, about a third of them containing only slight changes from the Bitcoin version from which they were forked. As case studies, we did a deep dive into 20 altcoins (e.g., Litecoin, FujiCoin, and Feathercoin) similar to the version of Bitcoin used for the fork. About half of them did not make any technically meaningful change - failing to comply with the promises (e.g., about using Proof of Stake) made in their whitepapers.

> Code embedding is a keystone in the application of machine learning on several Software Engineering (SE) tasks. To effectively support a plethora of SE tasks, the embedding needs to capture program syntax and semantics in a way that is generic. To this end, we propose the first self-supervised pre-training approach (called GraphCode2Vec) which produces task-agnostic embedding of lexical and program dependence features. GraphCode2Vec achieves this via a synergistic combination of code analysis and Graph Neural Networks. GraphCode2Vec is generic, it allows pre-training, and it is applicable to several SE downstream tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraphCode2Vec on four (4) tasks (method name prediction, solution classification, mutation testing and overfitted patch classification), and compare it with four (4) similarly generic code embedding baselines (Code2Seq, Code2Vec, CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT) and 7 task-specific, learning-based methods. In particular, GraphCode2Vec is more effective than both generic and task-specific learning-based baselines. It is also complementary and comparable to GraphCodeBERT (a larger and more complex model). We also demonstrate through a probing and ablation study that GraphCode2Vec learns lexical and program dependence features and that self-supervised pre-training improves effectiveness.

> Learning a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is hard when the number of parameters is too large given the amount of available data. As a remedy, we propose restricting the GMM to a Gaussian Markov Random Field Mixture Model (GMRF-MM), as well as a new method for estimating the latter's sparse precision (i.e., inverse covariance) matrices. When the sparsity pattern of each matrix is known, we propose an efficient optimization method for the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of that matrix. When it is unknown, we utilize the popular Graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (GLASSO) to estimate that pattern. However, we show that even for a single Gaussian, when GLASSO is tuned to successfully estimate the sparsity pattern, it does so at the price of a substantial bias of the values of the nonzero entries of the matrix, and we show that this problem only worsens in a mixture setting. To overcome this, we discard the nonzero values estimated by GLASSO, keep only its pattern estimate and use it within the proposed MLE method. This yields an effective two-step procedure that removes the bias. We show that our "debiasing" approach outperforms GLASSO in both the single-GMRF and the GMRF-MM cases. We also show that when learning priors for image patches, our method outperforms GLASSO even if we merely use an educated guess about the sparsity pattern, and that our GMRF-MM outperforms the baseline GMM on real and synthetic high-dimensional datasets.

> Accurate estimation of the tire slip ratio is critical for vehicle safety, as it is necessary for vehicle control purposes. In this paper, an intelligent tire system is presented to develop a novel slip ratio estimation model using machine learning algorithms. The accelerations, generated by a triaxial accelerometer installed onto the inner liner of the tire, are varied when the tire rotates to update the contact patch. Meanwhile, the slip ratio reference value can be measured by the MTS Flat-Trac tire test platform. Then, by analyzing the variation between the accelerations and slip ratio, highly useful features are discovered, which are especially promising for assessing vertical acceleration. For these features, machine learning (ML) algorithms are trained to build the slip ratio estimation model, in which the ML algorithms include artificial neural networks (ANNs), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), random forests (RFs), and support vector machines (SVMs). Finally, the estimated NRMS errors are evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation (CV). The proposed estimation model is able to estimate the slip ratio continuously and stably using only the acceleration from the intelligent tire system, and the estimated slip ratio range can reach 30%. The estimation results have high robustness to vehicle velocity and load, where the best NRMS errors can reach 4.88%. In summary, the present study with the fusion of an intelligent tire system and machine learning paves the way for the accurate estimation of the tire slip ratio under different driving conditions, which create new opportunities for autonomous vehicles, intelligent tires, and tire slip ratio estimation.

> This paper proposes PickNet, a neural network model for real-time channel selection for an ad hoc microphone array consisting of multiple recording devices like cell phones. Assuming at most one person to be vocally active at each time point, PickNet identifies the device that is spatially closest to the active person for each time frame by using a short spectral patch of just hundreds of milliseconds. The model is applied to every time frame, and the short time frame signals from the selected microphones are concatenated across the frames to produce an output signal. As the personal devices are usually held close to their owners, the output signal is expected to have higher signal-to-noise and direct-to-reverberation ratios on average than the input signals. Since PickNet utilizes only limited acoustic context at each time frame, the system using the proposed model works in real time and is robust to changes in acoustic conditions. Speech recognition-based evaluation was carried out by using real conversational recordings obtained with various smartphones. The proposed model yielded significant gains in word error rate with limited computational cost over systems using a block-online beamformer and a single distant microphone.

> Although convolutional networks have been the dominant architecture for vision tasks for many years, recent experiments have shown that Transformer-based models, most notably the Vision Transformer (ViT), may exceed their performance in some settings. However, due to the quadratic runtime of the self-attention layers in Transformers, ViTs require the use of patch embeddings, which group together small regions of the image into single input features, in order to be applied to larger image sizes. This raises a question: Is the performance of ViTs due to the inherently-more-powerful Transformer architecture, or is it at least partly due to using patches as the input representation? In this paper, we present some evidence for the latter: specifically, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple model that is similar in spirit to the ViT and the even-more-basic MLP-Mixer in that it operates directly on patches as input, separates the mixing of spatial and channel dimensions, and maintains equal size and resolution throughout the network. In contrast, however, the ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to achieve the mixing steps. Despite its simplicity, we show that the ConvMixer outperforms the ViT, MLP-Mixer, and some of their variants for similar parameter counts and data set sizes, in addition to outperforming classical vision models such as the ResNet.

> The most common use of data visualization is to minimize the complexity for proper understanding. A graph is one of the most commonly used representations for understanding relational data. It produces a simplified representation of data that is challenging to comprehend if kept in a textual format. In this study, we propose a methodology to utilize the relational properties of source code in the form of a graph to identify Just-in-Time (JIT) bug prediction in software systems during different revisions of software evolution and maintenance. We presented a method to convert the source codes of commit patches to equivalent graph representations and named it Source Code Graph (SCG). To understand and compare multiple source code graphs, we extracted several structural properties of these graphs, such as the density, number of cycles, nodes, edges, etc. We then utilized the attribute values of those SCGs to visualize and detect buggy software commits. We process more than 246K software commits from 12 subject systems in this investigation. Our investigation on these 12 open-source software projects written in C++ and Java programming languages shows that if we combine the features from SCG with conventional features used in similar studies, we will get the increased performance of Machine Learning (ML) based buggy commit detection models. We also find the increase of F1~Scores in predicting buggy and non-buggy commits statistically significant using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Since SCG-based feature values represent the style or structural properties of source code updates or changes in the software system, it suggests the importance of careful maintenance of source code style or structure for keeping a software system bug-free.

> Patch-seq, a recently developed experimental technique, allows neuroscientists to obtain transcriptomic and electrophysiological information from the same neurons. Efficiently analyzing and visualizing such paired multivariate data in order to extract biologically meaningful interpretations has, however, remained a challenge. Here, we use sparse deep neural networks with and without a two-dimensional bottleneck to predict electrophysiological features from the transcriptomic ones using a group lasso penalty, yielding concise and biologically interpretable two-dimensional visualizations. In two large example data sets, this visualization reveals known neural classes and their marker genes without biological prior knowledge. We also demonstrate that our method is applicable to other kinds of multimodal data, such as paired transcriptomic and proteomic measurements provided by CITE-seq.

Current published data indicates that addressing compiler warnings early is beneficial. However, support for this value theory stems from grey literature or is anecdotal. Additional focused research is needed to truly assess the cost-benefit of addressing warnings.

> Physical field reconstruction is highly desirable for the measurement and control of engineering systems. The reconstruction of the temperature field from limited observation plays a crucial role in thermal management for electronic equipment. Deep learning has been employed in physical field reconstruction, whereas the accurate estimation for the regions with large gradients is still diffcult. To solve the problem, this work proposes a novel deep learning method based on patchwise training to reconstruct the temperature field of electronic equipment accurately from limited observation. Firstly, the temperature field reconstruction (TFR) problem of the electronic equipment is modeled mathematically and transformed as an image-to-image regression task. Then a patchwise training and inference framework consisting of an adaptive UNet and a shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) is developed to establish the mapping from the observation to the temperature field. The adaptive UNet is utilized to reconstruct the whole temperature field while the MLP is designed to predict the patches with large temperature gradients. Experiments employing finite element simulation data are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Furthermore, the generalization is evaluated by investigating cases under different heat source layouts, different power intensities, and different observation point locations. The maximum absolute errors of the reconstructed temperature field are less than 1K under the patchwise training approach.

> This paper presents a way of doing large scale audio understanding without traditional state of the art neural architectures. Ever since the introduction of deep learning for understanding audio signals in the past decade, convolutional architectures have been able to achieve state of the art results surpassing traditional hand-crafted features. In the recent past, there has been a similar shift away from traditional convolutional and recurrent neural networks towards purely end-to-end Transformer architectures. We, in this work, explore an approach, based on Bag-of-Words model. Our approach does not have any convolutions, recurrence, attention, transformers or other approaches such as BERT. We utilize micro and macro level clustered vanilla embeddings, and use a MLP head for classification. We only use feed-forward encoder-decoder models to get the bottlenecks of spectral envelops, spectral patches and slices as well as multi-resolution spectra. A classification head (a feed-forward layer), similar to the approach in SimCLR is trained on a learned representation. Using simple codes learned on latent representations, we show how we surpass traditional convolutional neural network architectures, and come strikingly close to outperforming powerful Transformer architectures. This work hopefully would pave way for exciting advancements in the field of representation learning without massive, end-to-end neural architectures.

> The efficiency of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) depends on how the underlying geometry of the problem is taken into account. For distributions with strongly varying curvature, Riemannian metrics help in efficient exploration of the target distribution. Unfortunately, they have significant computational overhead due to e.g. repeated inversion of the metric tensor, and current geometric MCMC methods using the Fisher information matrix to induce the manifold are in practice slow. We propose a new alternative Riemannian metric for MCMC, by embedding the target distribution into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space as a Monge patch and using the induced metric determined by direct geometric reasoning. Our metric only requires first-order gradient information and has fast inverse and determinants, and allows reducing the computational complexity of individual iterations from cubic to quadratic in the problem dimensionality. We demonstrate how Lagrangian Monte Carlo in this metric efficiently explores the target distributions.

> The aim of this paper is to evaluate the security of a block-based image encryption for the vision transformer against jigsaw puzzle solver attacks. The vision transformer, a model for image classification based on the transformer architecture, is carried out by dividing an image into a grid of square patches. Some encryption schemes for the vision transformer have been proposed by applying block-based image encryption such as block scrambling and rotating to patches of the image. On the other hand, the security of encryption scheme for the vision transformer has never evaluated. In this paper, jigsaw puzzle solver attacks are utilized to evaluate the security of encrypted images by regarding the divided patches as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. In experiments, an image is resized and divided into patches to apply block scrambling-based image encryption, and then the security of encrypted images for the vision transformer against jigsaw puzzle solver attacks is evaluated.

> Recent success in the field of single image super-resolution (SISR) is achieved by optimizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the image space with the L1 or L2 loss. However, when trained with these loss functions, models usually fail to recover sharp edges present in the high-resolution (HR) images for the reason that the model tends to give a statistical average of potential HR solutions. During our research, we observe that gradient maps of images generated by the models trained with the L1 or L2 loss have significantly lower variance than the gradient maps of the original high-resolution images. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above issue by introducing a structure-enhancing loss function, coined Gradient Variance (GV) loss, and generate textures with perceptual-pleasant details. Specifically, during the training of the model, we extract patches from the gradient maps of the target and generated output, calculate the variance of each patch and form variance maps for these two images. Further, we minimize the distance between the computed variance maps to enforce the model to produce high variance gradient maps that will lead to the generation of high-resolution images with sharper edges. Experimental results show that the GV loss can significantly improve both Structure Similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance of existing image super-resolution (SR) deep learning models.

We evaluate Wolverine2 on 6400 buggy programs (generated using automated fault injection) on a variety of data-structures like singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, AVL trees, Red-Black trees, Splay Trees and Binary Search Trees; Wolverine2 could repair all the buggy instances within realistic programmer wait-time (less than 5 sec in most cases). Wolverine2 could also repair more than 80\% of the 247 (buggy) student submissions where a reasonable attempt was made.

- `2202.01490v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01490v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01490v1)

> Software developers are increasingly dependent on question and answer portals and blogs for coding solutions. While such interfaces provide useful information, there are concerns that code hosted here is often incorrect, insecure or incomplete. Previous work indeed detected a range of faults in code provided on Stack Overflow through the use of static analysis. Static analysis may go a far way towards quickly establishing the health of software code available online. In addition, mechanisms that enable rapid automated program improvement may then enhance such code. Accordingly, we present this proof of concept. We use the PMD static analysis tool to detect performance faults for a sample of Stack Overflow Java code snippets, before performing mutations on these snippets using GIN. We then re-analyse the performance faults in these snippets after the GIN mutations. GIN's RandomSampler was used to perform 17,986 unique line and statement patches on 3,034 snippets where PMD violations were removed from 770 patched versions. Our outcomes indicate that static analysis techniques may be combined with automated program improvement methods to enhance publicly available code with very little resource requirements. We discuss our planned research agenda in this regard.

> Keypoint detection and description play a central role in computer vision. Most existing methods are in the form of scene-level prediction, without returning the object classes of different keypoints. In this paper, we propose the object-centric formulation, which, beyond the conventional setting, requires further identifying which object each interest point belongs to. With such fine-grained information, our framework enables more downstream potentials, such as object-level matching and pose estimation in a clustered environment. To get around the difficulty of label collection in the real world, we develop a sim2real contrastive learning mechanism that can generalize the model trained in simulation to real-world applications. The novelties of our training method are three-fold: (i) we integrate the uncertainty into the learning framework to improve feature description of hard cases, e.g., less-textured or symmetric patches; (ii) we decouple the object descriptor into two output branches -- intra-object salience and inter-object distinctness, resulting in a better pixel-wise description; (iii) we enforce cross-view semantic consistency for enhanced robustness in representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on image matching and 6D pose estimation verify the encouraging generalization ability of our method from simulation to reality. Particularly for 6D pose estimation, our method significantly outperforms typical unsupervised/sim2real methods, achieving a closer gap with the fully supervised counterpart.

> The most natural method for evaluating program repair systems is to run them on bug datasets, such as Defects4J. Yet, using this evaluation technique on arbitrary real-world programs requires heavy configuration. In this paper, we propose a purely static method to evaluate the potential of the search space of repair approaches. This new method enables researchers and practitioners to encode the search spaces of repair approaches and select potentially useful ones without struggling with tool configuration and execution. We encode the search spaces by specifying the repair strategies they employ. Next, we use the specifications to check whether past commits lie in repair search spaces. For a repair approach, including many human-written past commits in its search space indicates its potential to generate useful patches. We implement our evaluation method in LighteR. LighteR gets a Git repository and outputs a list of commits whose source code changes lie in repair search spaces. We run LighteR on 55,309 commits from the history of 72 Github repositories with and show that LighteR's precision and recall are 77% and 92%, respectively. Overall, our experiments show that our novel method is both lightweight and effective to study the search space of program repair approaches.

> Neural networks are highly effective tools for image reconstruction problems such as denoising and compressive sensing. To date, neural networks for image reconstruction are almost exclusively convolutional. The most popular architecture is the U-Net, a convolutional network with a multi-resolution architecture. In this work, we show that a simple network based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-mixer enables state-of-the art image reconstruction performance without convolutions and without a multi-resolution architecture, provided that the training set and the size of the network are moderately large. Similar to the original MLP-mixer, the image-to-image MLP-mixer is based exclusively on MLPs operating on linearly-transformed image patches. Contrary to the original MLP-mixer, we incorporate structure by retaining the relative positions of the image patches. This imposes an inductive bias towards natural images which enables the image-to-image MLP-mixer to learn to denoise images based on fewer examples than the original MLP-mixer. Moreover, the image-to-image MLP-mixer requires fewer parameters to achieve the same denoising performance than the U-Net and its parameters scale linearly in the image resolution instead of quadratically as for the original MLP-mixer. If trained on a moderate amount of examples for denoising, the image-to-image MLP-mixer outperforms the U-Net by a slight margin. It also outperforms the vision transformer tailored for image reconstruction and classical un-trained methods such as BM3D, making it a very effective tool for image reconstruction problems.

> Reproducibility is an increasing concern in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the area of Deep Learning (DL). Being able to reproduce DL models is crucial for AI-based systems, as it is closely tied to various tasks like training, testing, debugging, and auditing. However, DL models are challenging to be reproduced due to issues like randomness in the software (e.g., DL algorithms) and non-determinism in the hardware (e.g., GPU). There are various practices to mitigate some of the aforementioned issues. However, many of them are either too intrusive or can only work for a specific usage context. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to training reproducible DL models. Our approach includes three main parts: (1) a set of general criteria to thoroughly evaluate the reproducibility of DL models for two different domains, (2) a unified framework which leverages a record-and-replay technique to mitigate software-related randomness and a profile-and-patch technique to control hardware-related non-determinism, and (3) a reproducibility guideline which explains the rationales and the mitigation strategies on conducting a reproducible training process for DL models. Case study results show our approach can successfully reproduce six open source and one commercial DL models.

> Deep learning (DL) has become an integral part of solutions to various important problems, which is why ensuring the quality of DL systems is essential. One of the challenges of achieving reliability and robustness of DL software is to ensure that algorithm implementations are numerically stable. DL algorithms require a large amount and a wide variety of numerical computations. A naive implementation of numerical computation can lead to errors that may result in incorrect or inaccurate learning and results. A numerical algorithm or a mathematical formula can have several implementations that are mathematically equivalent, but have different numerical stability properties. Designing numerically stable algorithm implementations is challenging, because it requires an interdisciplinary knowledge of software engineering, DL, and numerical analysis. In this paper, we study two mature DL libraries PyTorch and Tensorflow with the goal of identifying unstable numerical methods and their solutions. Specifically, we investigate which DL algorithms are numerically unstable and conduct an in-depth analysis of the root cause, manifestation, and patches to numerical instabilities. Based on these findings, we launch, the first database of numerical stability issues and solutions in DL. Our findings and provide future references to developers and tool builders to prevent, detect, localize and fix numerically unstable algorithm implementations. To demonstrate that, using {\it DeepStability} we have located numerical stability issues in Tensorflow, and submitted a fix which has been accepted and merged in.

> We propose a versatile framework based on random search, Sparse-RS, for score-based sparse targeted and untargeted attacks in the black-box setting. Sparse-RS does not rely on substitute models and achieves state-of-the-art success rate and query efficiency for multiple sparse attack models: $l_0$-bounded perturbations, adversarial patches, and adversarial frames. The $l_0$-version of untargeted Sparse-RS outperforms all black-box and even all white-box attacks for different models on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Moreover, our untargeted Sparse-RS achieves very high success rates even for the challenging settings of $20\times20$ adversarial patches and $2$-pixel wide adversarial frames for $224\times224$ images. Finally, we show that Sparse-RS can be applied to generate targeted universal adversarial patches where it significantly outperforms the existing approaches. The code of our framework is available at https://github.com/fra31/sparse-rs.

> "Masked Autoencoders (MAE) Are Scalable Vision Learners" revolutionizes the self-supervised learning method in that it not only achieves the state-of-the-art for image pre-training, but is also a milestone that bridges the gap between visual and linguistic masked autoencoding (BERT-style) pre-trainings. However, to our knowledge, to date there are no theoretical perspectives to explain the powerful expressivity of MAE. In this paper, we, for the first time, propose a unified theoretical framework that provides a mathematical understanding for MAE. Specifically, we explain the patch-based attention approaches of MAE using an integral kernel under a non-overlapping domain decomposition setting. To help the research community to further comprehend the main reasons of the great success of MAE, based on our framework, we pose five questions and answer them with mathematical rigor using insights from operator theory.

<summary>2022-02-09 23:05:48 - Providing Real-time Assistance for Repairing Runtime Exceptions using Stack Overflow Posts</summary>

- *Sonal Mahajan, Mukul R. Prasad*

> Runtime Exceptions (REs) are an important class of bugs that occur frequently during code development. Traditional Automatic Program Repair (APR) tools are of limited use in this "in-development" use case, since they require a test-suite to be available as a patching oracle. Thus, developers typically tend to manually resolve their in-development REs, often by referring to technical forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). To automate this manual process we extend our previous work, MAESTRO, to provide real-time assistance to developers for repairing Java REs by recommending a relevant patch-suggesting SO post and synthesizing a repair patch from this post to fix the RE in the developer's code. MAESTRO exploits a library of Runtime Exception Patterns (REPs) semi-automatically mined from SO posts, through a relatively inexpensive, one-time, incremental process. An REP is an abstracted sequence of statements that triggers a given RE. REPs are used to index SO posts, retrieve a post most relevant to the RE instance exhibited by a developer's code and then mediate the process of extracting a concrete repair from the SO post, abstracting out post-specific details, and concretizing the repair to the developer's buggy code. We evaluate MAESTRO on a published RE benchmark comprised of 78 instances. MAESTRO is able to generate a correct repair patch at the top position in 27% of the cases, within the top-3 in 40% of the cases and overall return a useful artifact in 81% of the cases. Further, the use of REPs proves instrumental to all aspects of MAESTRO's performance, from ranking and searching of SO posts to synthesizing patches from a given post. In particular, 45% of correct patches generated by MAESTRO could not be produced by a baseline technique not using REPs, even when provided with MAESTRO's SO-post ranking. MAESTRO is also fast, needing around 1 second, on average, to generate its output.

> Dynamic graph neural networks have been widely used in modeling and representation learning of graph structure data. Current dynamic representation learning focuses on either discrete learning which results in temporal information loss or continuous learning that involves heavy computation. In this work, we proposed a novel dynamic graph neural network, Sparse-Dyn. It adaptively encodes temporal information into a sequence of patches with an equal amount of temporal-topological structure. Therefore, while avoiding the use of snapshots which causes information loss, it also achieves a finer time granularity, which is close to what continuous networks could provide. In addition, we also designed a lightweight module, Sparse Temporal Transformer, to compute node representations through both structural neighborhoods and temporal dynamics. Since the fully-connected attention conjunction is simplified, the computation cost is far lower than the current state-of-the-arts. Link prediction experiments are conducted on both continuous and discrete graph datasets. Through comparing with several state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines, the experimental results demonstrate that Sparse-Dyn has a faster inference speed while having competitive performance.

> Recently, neural networks based purely on self-attention, such as the Vision Transformer (ViT), have been shown to outperform deep learning models constructed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on various vision tasks, thus extending the success of Transformers, which were originally developed for language processing, to the vision domain. A recent study showed that a similar methodology can also be applied to the audio domain. Specifically, the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) achieves state-of-the-art results on various audio classification benchmarks. However, pure Transformer models tend to require more training data compared to CNNs, and the success of the AST relies on supervised pretraining that requires a large amount of labeled data and a complex training pipeline, thus limiting the practical usage of AST.   This paper focuses on audio and speech classification, and aims to reduce the need for large amounts of labeled data for AST by leveraging self-supervised learning using unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose to pretrain the AST model with joint discriminative and generative masked spectrogram patch modeling (MSPM) using unlabeled audio from AudioSet and Librispeech. We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech classification tasks including audio event classification, keyword spotting, emotion recognition, and speaker identification. The proposed self-supervised framework significantly boosts AST performance on all tasks, with an average improvement of 60.9%, leading to similar or even better results than a supervised pretrained AST. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first patch-based self-supervised learning framework in the audio and speech domain, and also the first self-supervised learning framework for AST.

> Automated program repair is an emerging technology that seeks to automatically rectify bugs and vulnerabilities using learning, search, and semantic analysis. Trust in automatically generated patches is necessary for achieving greater adoption of program repair. Towards this goal, we survey more than 100 software practitioners to understand the artifacts and setups needed to enhance trust in automatically generated patches. Based on the feedback from the survey on developer preferences, we quantitatively evaluate existing test-suite based program repair tools. We find that they cannot produce high-quality patches within a top-10 ranking and an acceptable time period of 1 hour. The developer feedback from our qualitative study and the observations from our quantitative examination of existing repair tools point to actionable insights to drive program repair research. Specifically, we note that producing repairs within an acceptable time-bound is very much dependent on leveraging an abstract search space representation of a rich enough search space. Moreover, while additional developer inputs are valuable for generating or ranking patches, developers do not seem to be interested in a significant human-in-the-loop interaction.

> Corporate Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) enable users to work from home or while traveling. At the same time, VPNs are tied to a company's network infrastructure, forcing users to install proprietary clients for network compatibility reasons. VPN clients run with high privileges to encrypt and reroute network traffic. Thus, bugs in VPN clients pose a substantial risk to their users and in turn the corporate network. Cisco, the dominating vendor of enterprise network hardware, offers VPN connectivity with their AnyConnect client for desktop and mobile devices. While past security research primarily focused on the AnyConnect Windows client, we show that Linux and iOS are based on different architectures and have distinct security issues. Our reverse engineering as well as the follow-up design analysis and fuzzing reveal 13 new vulnerabilities. Seven of these are located in the Linux client. The root cause for privilege escalations on Linux is anchored so deep in the client's architecture that it only got patched with a partial workaround. A similar analysis on iOS uncovers three AnyConnect-specific bugs as well as three general issues in iOS network extensions, which apply to all kinds of VPNs and are not restricted to AnyConnect.

> Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in areas with similar scenes such as urban or indoor scenarios is a major challenge. Existing VPR methods using global descriptors have difficulty capturing local specific regions (LSR) in the scene and are therefore prone to localization confusion in such scenarios. As a result, finding the LSR that are critical for location recognition becomes key. To address this challenge, we introduced Patch-NetVLAD+, which was inspired by patch-based VPR researches. Our method proposed a fine-tuning strategy with triplet loss to make NetVLAD suitable for extracting patch-level descriptors. Moreover, unlike existing methods that treat all patches in an image equally, our method extracts patches of LSR, which present less frequently throughout the dataset, and makes them play an important role in VPR by assigning proper weights to them. Experiments on Pittsburgh30k and Tokyo247 datasets show that our approach achieved up to 6.35\% performance improvement than existing patch-based methods.

> Nowadays, data has become an invaluable asset to entities and companies, and keeping it secure represents a major challenge. Data centers are responsible for storing data provided by software applications. Nevertheless, the number of vulnerabilities has been increasing every day. Managing such vulnerabilities is essential for building a reliable and secure network environment. Releasing patches to fix security flaws in software is a common practice to handle these vulnerabilities. However, prioritization becomes crucial for organizations with an increasing number of vulnerabilities since time and resources to fix them are usually limited. This review intends to present a survey of vulnerability ranking techniques and promote a discussion on how multi-objective optimization could benefit the management of vulnerabilities risk prioritization. The state-of-the-art approaches for risk prioritization were reviewed, intending to develop an effective model for ranking vulnerabilities in data centers. The main contribution of this work is to point out multi-objective optimization as a not commonly explored but promising strategy to prioritize vulnerabilities, enabling better time management and increasing security.

> Image-to-image (i2i) networks struggle to capture local changes because they do not affect the global scene structure. For example, translating from highway scenes to offroad, i2i networks easily focus on global color features but ignore obvious traits for humans like the absence of lane markings. In this paper, we leverage human knowledge about spatial domain characteristics which we refer to as 'local domains' and demonstrate its benefit for image-to-image translation. Relying on a simple geometrical guidance, we train a patch-based GAN on few source data and hallucinate a new unseen domain which subsequently eases transfer learning to target. We experiment on three tasks ranging from unstructured environments to adverse weather. Our comprehensive evaluation setting shows we are able to generate realistic translations, with minimal priors, and training only on a few images. Furthermore, when trained on our translations images we show that all tested proxy tasks are significantly improved, without ever seeing target domain at training.

> A key advantage of isogeometric discretizations is their accurate and well-behaved eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes. For degree two and higher, however, optical branches of spurious outlier frequencies and modes may appear due to boundaries or reduced continuity at patch interfaces. In this paper, we introduce a variational approach based on perturbed eigenvalue analysis that eliminates outlier frequencies without negatively affecting the accuracy in the remainder of the spectrum and modes. We then propose a pragmatic iterative procedure that estimates the perturbation parameters in such a way that the outlier frequencies are effectively reduced. We demonstrate that our approach allows for a much larger critical time-step size in explicit dynamics calculations. In addition, we show that the critical time-step size obtained with the proposed approach does not depend on the polynomial degree of spline basis functions.

> Inspired by the tremendous success of the self-attention mechanism in natural language processing, the Vision Transformer (ViT) creatively applies it to image patch sequences and achieves incredible performance. However, the scaled dot-product self-attention of ViT brings about scale ambiguity to the structure of the original feature space. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named Orthogonal Vision Transformer (O-ViT), to optimize ViT from the geometric perspective. O-ViT limits parameters of self-attention blocks to be on the norm-keeping orthogonal manifold, which can keep the geometry of the feature space. Moreover, O-ViT achieves both orthogonal constraints and cheap optimization overhead by adopting a surjective mapping between the orthogonal group and its Lie algebra.We have conducted comparative experiments on image recognition tasks to demonstrate O-ViT's validity and experiments show that O-ViT can boost the performance of ViT by up to 3.6%.

> Reopened bugs can degrade the overall quality of a software system since they require unnecessary rework by developers. Moreover, reopened bugs also lead to a loss of trust in the end-users regarding the quality of the software. Thus, predicting bugs that might be reopened could be extremely helpful for software developers to avoid rework. Prior studies on reopened bug prediction focus only on three open source projects (i.e., Apache, Eclipse, and OpenOffice) to generate insights. We observe that one out of the three projects (i.e., Apache) has a data leak issue -- the bug status of reopened was included as training data to predict reopened bugs. In addition, prior studies used an outdated prediction model pipeline (i.e., with old techniques for constructing a prediction model) to predict reopened bugs. Therefore, we revisit the reopened bugs study on a large scale dataset consisting of 47 projects tracked by JIRA using the modern techniques such as SMOTE, permutation importance together with 7 different machine learning models. We study the reopened bugs using a mixed methods approach (i.e., both quantitative and qualitative study). We find that: 1) After using an updated reopened bug prediction model pipeline, only 34% projects give an acceptable performance with AUC >= 0.7. 2) There are four major reasons for a bug getting reopened, that is, technical (i.e., patch/integration issues), documentation, human (i.e., due to incorrect bug assessment), and reasons not shown in the bug reports. 3) In projects with an acceptable AUC, 94% of the reopened bugs are due to patch issues (i.e., the usage of an incorrect patch) identified before bug reopening. Our study revisits reopened bugs and provides new insights into developer's bug reopening activities.

In this paper, an augmentation method, called TensorMixup, was proposed and applied to the three dimensional U-Net architecture for brain tumor segmentation. The main ideas included that first, two image patches with size of 128 in three dimensions were selected according to glioma information of ground truth labels from the magnetic resonance imaging data of any two patients with the same modality. Next, a tensor in which all elements were independently sampled from Beta distribution was used to mix the image patches. Then the tensor was mapped to a matrix which was used to mix the one-hot encoded labels of the above image patches. Therefore, a new image and its one-hot encoded label were synthesized. Finally, the new data was used to train the model which could be used to segment glioma. The experimental results show that the mean accuracy of Dice scores are 91.32%, 85.67%, and 82.20% respectively on the whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor segmentation, which proves that the proposed TensorMixup is feasible and effective for brain tumor segmentation.

> Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial component of 6-DoF localization, visual SLAM and structure-from-motion pipelines, tasked to generate an initial list of place match hypotheses by matching global place descriptors. However, commonly-used CNN-based methods either process multiple image resolutions after training or use a single resolution and limit multi-scale feature extraction to the last convolutional layer during training. In this paper, we augment NetVLAD representation learning with low-resolution image pyramid encoding which leads to richer place representations. The resultant multi-resolution feature pyramid can be conveniently aggregated through VLAD into a single compact representation, avoiding the need for concatenation or summation of multiple patches in recent multi-scale approaches. Furthermore, we show that the underlying learnt feature tensor can be combined with existing multi-scale approaches to improve their baseline performance. Evaluation on 15 viewpoint-varying and viewpoint-consistent benchmarking datasets confirm that the proposed MultiRes-NetVLAD leads to state-of-the-art Recall@N performance for global descriptor based retrieval, compared against 11 existing techniques.

> DNNs' demand for massive data forces practitioners to collect data from the Internet without careful check due to the unacceptable cost, which brings potential risks of backdoor attacks. A backdoored model always predicts a target class in the presence of a predefined trigger pattern, which can be easily realized via poisoning a small amount of data. In general, adversarial training is believed to defend against backdoor attacks since it helps models to keep their prediction unchanged even if we perturb the input image (as long as within a feasible range). Unfortunately, few previous studies succeed in doing so. To explore whether adversarial training could defend against backdoor attacks or not, we conduct extensive experiments across different threat models and perturbation budgets, and find the threat model in adversarial training matters. For instance, adversarial training with spatial adversarial examples provides notable robustness against commonly-used patch-based backdoor attacks. We further propose a hybrid strategy which provides satisfactory robustness across different backdoor attacks.

> The visual dialog task attempts to train an agent to answer multi-turn questions given an image, which requires the deep understanding of interactions between the image and dialog history. Existing researches tend to employ the modality-specific modules to model the interactions, which might be troublesome to use. To fill in this gap, we propose a unified framework for image-text joint embedding, named VU-BERT, and apply patch projection to obtain vision embedding firstly in visual dialog tasks to simplify the model. The model is trained over two tasks: masked language modeling and next utterance retrieval. These tasks help in learning visual concepts, utterances dependence, and the relationships between these two modalities. Finally, our VU-BERT achieves competitive performance (0.7287 NDCG scores) on VisDial v1.0 Datasets.

> Hyper-realistic face image generation and manipulation have givenrise to numerous unethical social issues, e.g., invasion of privacy,threat of security, and malicious political maneuvering, which re-sulted in the development of recent deepfake detection methods with the rising demands of deepfake forensics. Proposed deepfake detection methods to date have shown remarkable detection performance and robustness. However, none of the suggested deepfake detection methods assessed the performance of deepfakes with the facemask during the pandemic crisis after the outbreak of theCovid-19. In this paper, we thoroughly evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on the deepfakes with the facemask. Also, we propose two approaches to enhance the masked deepfakes detection: face-patch and face-crop. The experimental evaluations on both methods are assessed through the base-line deepfake detection models on the various deepfake datasets. Our extensive experiments show that, among the two methods, face-crop performs better than the face-patch, and could be a train method for deepfake detection models to detect fake faces with facemask in real world.

> Transformers are widely applied to solve natural language understanding and computer vision tasks. While scaling up these architectures leads to improved performance, it often comes at the expense of much higher computational costs. In order for large-scale models to remain practical in real-world systems, there is a need for reducing their computational overhead. In this work, we present the PatchMerger, a simple module that reduces the number of patches or tokens the network has to process by merging them between two consecutive intermediate layers. We show that the PatchMerger achieves a significant speedup across various model sizes while matching the original performance both upstream and downstream after fine-tuning.

> This work presents a deep learning-based framework for the solution of partial differential equations on complex computational domains described with computer-aided design tools. To account for the underlying distribution of the training data caused by spline-based projections from the reference to the physical domain, a variational neural solver equipped with an importance sampling scheme is developed, such that the loss function based on the discretized energy functional obtained after the weak formulation is modified according to the sample distribution. To tackle multi-patch domains possibly leading to solution discontinuities, the variational neural solver is additionally combined with a domain decomposition approach based on the Discontinuous Galerkin formulation. The proposed neural solver is verified on a toy problem and then applied to a real-world engineering test case, namely that of electric machine simulation. The numerical results show clearly that the neural solver produces physics-conforming solutions of significantly improved accuracy.

> Cycle reconstruction regularized adversarial training -- e.g., CycleGAN, DiscoGAN, and DualGAN -- has been widely used for image style transfer with unpaired training data. Several recent works, however, have shown that local distortions are frequent, and structural consistency cannot be guaranteed. Targeting this issue, prior works usually relied on additional segmentation or consistent feature extraction steps that are task-specific. To counter this, this work aims to learn a general add-on structural feature extractor, by explicitly enforcing the structural alignment between an input and its synthesized image. Specifically, we propose a novel input-output image patches self-training scheme to achieve a disentanglement of underlying anatomical structures and imaging modalities. The translator and structure encoder are updated, following an alternating training protocol. In addition, the information w.r.t. imaging modality can be eliminated with an asymmetric adversarial game. We train, validate, and test our network on 1,768, 416, and 1,560 unpaired subject-independent slices of tagged and cine magnetic resonance imaging from a total of twenty healthy subjects, respectively, demonstrating superior performance over competing methods.

> This paper investigates an adversary's ease of attack in generating adversarial examples for real-world scenarios. We address three key requirements for practical attacks for the real-world: 1) automatically constraining the size and shape of the attack so it can be applied with stickers, 2) transform-robustness, i.e., robustness of a attack to environmental physical variations such as viewpoint and lighting changes, and 3) supporting attacks in not only white-box, but also black-box hard-label scenarios, so that the adversary can attack proprietary models. In this work, we propose GRAPHITE, an efficient and general framework for generating attacks that satisfy the above three key requirements. GRAPHITE takes advantage of transform-robustness, a metric based on expectation over transforms (EoT), to automatically generate small masks and optimize with gradient-free optimization. GRAPHITE is also flexible as it can easily trade-off transform-robustness, perturbation size, and query count in black-box settings. On a GTSRB model in a hard-label black-box setting, we are able to find attacks on all possible 1,806 victim-target class pairs with averages of 77.8% transform-robustness, perturbation size of 16.63% of the victim images, and 126K queries per pair. For digital-only attacks where achieving transform-robustness is not a requirement, GRAPHITE is able to find successful small-patch attacks with an average of only 566 queries for 92.2% of victim-target pairs. GRAPHITE is also able to find successful attacks using perturbations that modify small areas of the input image against PatchGuard, a recently proposed defense against patch-based attacks.

> Multi-Channel Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks are special MitM attacks capable of manipulating encrypted Wi-Fi wireless frames between two legitimate endpoints. Since its inception in 2014, attackers have been targeting WPA Wi-Fi networks to perform different attacks, such as cipher downgrades, denial of service, key reinstallation Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks (KRACK) in 2017, and recently FragAttacks in 2021, which widely impacted millions of Wi-Fi Multi-Channel MitM (MC-MitM) devices, especially IoT devices. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature that KRACK holistically review the different types of Multi-Channel MitM enabled attacks and analyze their potential Internet of Things (IoT) impact. To this end, we evaluate the capabilities of Multi-Channel MitM and review every reported attack in Encryption the state of the art. We examine practical issues that hamper the total adoption of protection mechanisms, i.e., Security security patches and Protected Management Frames (PMF), and review available defense mechanisms in FragAttacks confronting the Multi-Channel MitM enabled attacks in the IoT context. Finally, we highlight the potential research problems and identify future research lines in this field.

> High-dimensional imaging is becoming increasingly relevant in many fields from astronomy and cultural heritage to systems biology. Visual exploration of such high-dimensional data is commonly facilitated by dimensionality reduction. However, common dimensionality reduction methods do not include spatial information present in images, such as local texture features, into the construction of low-dimensional embeddings. Consequently, exploration of such data is typically split into a step focusing on the attribute space followed by a step focusing on spatial information, or vice versa. In this paper, we present a method for incorporating spatial neighborhood information into distance-based dimensionality reduction methods, such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We achieve this by modifying the distance measure between high-dimensional attribute vectors associated with each pixel such that it takes the pixel's spatial neighborhood into account. Based on a classification of different methods for comparing image patches, we explore a number of different approaches. We compare these approaches from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Finally, we illustrate the value of the proposed methods by qualitative and quantitative evaluation on synthetic data and two real-world use cases.

> Single image generation (SIG), described as generating diverse samples that have similar visual content with the given single image, is first introduced by SinGAN which builds a pyramid of GANs to progressively learn the internal patch distribution of the single image. It also shows great potentials in a wide range of image manipulation tasks. However, the paradigm of SinGAN has limitations in terms of generation quality and training time. Firstly, due to the lack of high-level information, SinGAN cannot handle the object images well as it does on the scene and texture images. Secondly, the separate progressive training scheme is time-consuming and easy to cause artifact accumulation. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we dig into the SIG problem and improve SinGAN by fully-utilization of internal and external priors. The main contributions of this paper include: 1) We introduce to SIG a regularized latent variable model. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to give a clear formulation and optimization goal of SIG, and all the existing methods for SIG can be regarded as special cases of this model. 2) We design a novel Prior-based end-to-end training GAN (PetsGAN) to overcome the problems of SinGAN. Our method gets rid of the time-consuming progressive training scheme and can be trained end-to-end. 3) We construct abundant qualitative and quantitative experiments to show the superiority of our method on both generated image quality, diversity, and the training speed. Moreover, we apply our method to other image manipulation tasks (e.g., style transfer, harmonization), and the results further prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

> Vision transformers (ViTs) process input images as sequences of patches via self-attention; a radically different architecture than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This makes it interesting to study the adversarial feature space of ViT models and their transferability. In particular, we observe that adversarial patterns found via conventional adversarial attacks show very \emph{low} black-box transferability even for large ViT models. We show that this phenomenon is only due to the sub-optimal attack procedures that do not leverage the true representation potential of ViTs. A deep ViT is composed of multiple blocks, with a consistent architecture comprising of self-attention and feed-forward layers, where each block is capable of independently producing a class token. Formulating an attack using only the last class token (conventional approach) does not directly leverage the discriminative information stored in the earlier tokens, leading to poor adversarial transferability of ViTs. Using the compositional nature of ViT models, we enhance transferability of existing attacks by introducing two novel strategies specific to the architecture of ViT models. (i) Self-Ensemble: We propose a method to find multiple discriminative pathways by dissecting a single ViT model into an ensemble of networks. This allows explicitly utilizing class-specific information at each ViT block. (ii) Token Refinement: We then propose to refine the tokens to further enhance the discriminative capacity at each block of ViT. Our token refinement systematically combines the class tokens with structural information preserved within the patch tokens.

> Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage, also known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is critical since some patients with progressive MCI will develop the disease. We propose a multi-stream deep convolutional neural network fed with patch-based imaging data to classify stable MCI and progressive MCI. First, we compare MRI images of Alzheimer's disease with cognitively normal subjects to identify distinct anatomical landmarks using a multivariate statistical test. These landmarks are then used to extract patches that are fed into the proposed multi-stream convolutional neural network to classify MRI images. Next, we train the architecture in a separate scenario using samples from Alzheimer's disease images, which are anatomically similar to the progressive MCI ones and cognitively normal images to compensate for the lack of progressive MCI training data. Finally, we transfer the trained model weights to the proposed architecture in order to fine-tune the model using progressive MCI and stable MCI data. Experimental results on the ADNI-1 dataset indicate that our method outperforms existing methods for MCI classification, with an F1-score of 85.96%.

> As quotidian use of sophisticated cameras surges, people in modern society are more interested in capturing fine-quality images. However, the quality of the images might be inferior to people's expectations due to the noise contamination in the images. Thus, filtering out the noise while preserving vital image features is an essential requirement. Current existing denoising methods have their own assumptions on the probability distribution in which the contaminated noise is sampled for the method to attain its expected denoising performance. In this paper, we utilize our recent Gramian-based filtering scheme to remove noise sampled from five prominent probability distributions from selected images. This method preserves image smoothness by adopting patches partitioned from the image, rather than pixels, and retains vital image features by performing denoising on the manifold underlying the patch space rather than in the image domain. We validate its denoising performance, using three benchmark computer vision test images applied to two state-of-the-art denoising methods, namely BM3D and K-SVD.

> This paper is an introductory discussion on the cause of open source software vulnerabilities, their importance in the cybersecurity ecosystem, and a selection of detection methods. A recent application security report showed 44% of applications contain critical vulnerabilities in an open source component, a concerning proportion. Most companies do not have a reliable way of being directly and promptly notified when zero-day vulnerabilities are found and then when patches are made available. This means attack vectors in open source exist longer than necessary. Conventional approaches to vulnerability detection are outlined alongside some newer research trends. A conclusion is made that it may not be possible to entirely replace expert human inspection of open source software, although it can be effectively augmented with techniques such as machine learning, IDE plug-ins and repository linking to make implementation and review less time intensive. Underpinning any technological advances should be better knowledge at the human level. Development teams need trained, coached and improved so they can implement open source more securely, know what vulnerabilities to look for and how to handle them. It is the use of this blended approach to detection which is key.

> Adversarial patches are optimized contiguous pixel blocks in an input image that cause a machine-learning model to misclassify it. However, their optimization is computationally demanding, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning, potentially leading to suboptimal robustness evaluations. To overcome these issues, we propose ImageNet-Patch, a dataset to benchmark machine-learning models against adversarial patches. It consists of a set of patches, optimized to generalize across different models, and readily applicable to ImageNet data after preprocessing them with affine transformations. This process enables an approximate yet faster robustness evaluation, leveraging the transferability of adversarial perturbations. We showcase the usefulness of this dataset by testing the effectiveness of the computed patches against 127 models. We conclude by discussing how our dataset could be used as a benchmark for robustness, and how our methodology can be generalized to other domains. We open source our dataset and evaluation code at https://github.com/pralab/ImageNet-Patch.

AiD Regen seamlessly binds the full pipeline, which includes RGB-D image capturing, semantic segmentation, boundary-guided point-cloud processing, 3D model reconstruction, and 3D printable G-code generation, into a single system that can be used out of the box. We developed a multi-stage data preprocessing method to handle small and unbalanced DFU image datasets. AiD Regen's human-in-the-loop machine learning interface enables clinicians to not only create 3D regenerative patches with just a few touch interactions but also customize and confirm wound boundaries. As evidenced by our experiments, our model outperforms prior wound segmentation models and our reconstruction algorithm is capable of generating 3D wound models with compelling accuracy. We further conducted a case study on a real DFU patient and demonstrated the effectiveness of AiD Regen in treating DFU wounds.

> Being able to learn on weakly labeled data, and provide interpretability, are two of the main reasons why attention-based deep multiple instance learning (ABMIL) methods have become particularly popular for classification of histopathological images. Such image data usually come in the form of gigapixel-sized whole-slide-images (WSI) that are cropped into smaller patches (instances). However, the sheer size of the data makes training of ABMIL models challenging. All the instances from one WSI cannot be processed at once by conventional GPUs. Existing solutions compromise training by relying on pre-trained models, strategic sampling or selection of instances, or self-supervised learning. We propose a training strategy based on gradient accumulation that enables direct end-to-end training of ABMIL models without being limited by GPU memory. We conduct experiments on both QMNIST and Imagenette to investigate the performance and training time, and compare with the conventional memory-expensive baseline and a recent sampled-based approach. This memory-efficient approach, although slower, reaches performance indistinguishable from the memory-expensive baseline.

> Vision transformer (ViT) has achieved competitive accuracy on a variety of computer vision applications, but its computational cost impedes the deployment on resource-limited mobile devices.   We explore the sparsity in ViT and observe that informative patches and heads are sufficient for accurate image recognition.   In this paper, we propose a cascade pruning framework named CP-ViT by predicting sparsity in ViT models progressively and dynamically to reduce computational redundancy while minimizing the accuracy loss. Specifically, we define the cumulative score to reserve the informative patches and heads across the ViT model for better accuracy. We also propose the dynamic pruning ratio adjustment technique based on layer-aware attention range. CP-ViT has great general applicability for practical deployment, which can be applied to a wide range of ViT models and can achieve superior accuracy with or without fine-tuning.   Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with various pre-trained models have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of CP-ViT. By progressively pruning 50\% patches, our CP-ViT method reduces over 40\% FLOPs while maintaining accuracy loss within 1\%.

> Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in numerous real-world scenarios, such as industrial automation and manufacturing intelligence. Recently, variational inference-based anomaly analysis has attracted researchers' and developers' attention. It aims to model the defect-free distribution so that anomalies can be classified as out-of-distribution samples. Nevertheless, there are two disturbing factors that need us to prioritize: (i) the simplistic prior latent distribution inducing limited expressive capability; (ii) the strong probability distance notion results in collapsed features. In this paper, we propose a novel Patch-wise Wasserstein AutoEncoder (P-WAE) architecture to alleviate those challenges. In particular, a patch-wise variational inference model coupled with solving the jigsaw puzzle is designed, which is a simple yet effective way to increase the expressiveness of the latent manifold. This makes using the model on high-dimensional practical data possible. In addition, we leverage a weaker measure, sliced-Wasserstein distance, to achieve the equilibrium between the reconstruction fidelity and generalized representations. Comprehensive experiments, conducted on the MVTec AD dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

> Vision Transformer (ViT) has recently demonstrated promise in computer vision problems. However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), it is known that the performance of ViT saturates quickly with depth increasing, due to the observed attention collapse or patch uniformity. Despite a couple of empirical solutions, a rigorous framework studying on this scalability issue remains elusive. In this paper, we first establish a rigorous theory framework to analyze ViT features from the Fourier spectrum domain. We show that the self-attention mechanism inherently amounts to a low-pass filter, which indicates when ViT scales up its depth, excessive low-pass filtering will cause feature maps to only preserve their Direct-Current (DC) component. We then propose two straightforward yet effective techniques to mitigate the undesirable low-pass limitation. The first technique, termed AttnScale, decomposes a self-attention block into low-pass and high-pass components, then rescales and combines these two filters to produce an all-pass self-attention matrix. The second technique, termed FeatScale, re-weights feature maps on separate frequency bands to amplify the high-frequency signals. Both techniques are efficient and hyperparameter-free, while effectively overcoming relevant ViT training artifacts such as attention collapse and patch uniformity. By seamlessly plugging in our techniques to multiple ViT variants, we demonstrate that they consistently help ViTs benefit from deeper architectures, bringing up to 1.1% performance gains "for free" (e.g., with little parameter overhead). We publicly release our codes and pre-trained models at https://github.com/VITA-Group/ViT-Anti-Oversmoothing.

> Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a crucial task for precise 3D reconstruction. Most recent studies tried to improve the performance of matching cost volume in MVS by designing aggregated 3D cost volumes and their regularization. This paper focuses on learning a robust feature extraction network to enhance the performance of matching costs without heavy computation in the other steps. In particular, we present a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet. It is composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface. As a result, CDFSNet can estimate the optimal patch scales to learn discriminative features for accurate matching computation between reference and source images. By combining the robust extracted features with an appropriate cost formulation strategy, our resulting MVS architecture can estimate depth maps more precisely. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on complex outdoor scenes. It significantly improves the completeness of reconstructed models. As a result, the method can process higher resolution inputs within faster run-time and lower memory than other MVS methods.

> This study proposes a framework for manifold learning of image patches using the concept of equivalence classes: manifold modeling in quotient space (MMQS). In MMQS, we do not consider a set of local patches of the image as it is, but rather the set of their canonical patches obtained by introducing the concept of equivalence classes and performing manifold learning on their canonical patches. Canonical patches represent equivalence classes, and their auto-encoder constructs a manifold in the quotient space. Based on this framework, we produce a novel manifold-based image model by introducing rotation-flip-equivalence relations. In addition, we formulate an image reconstruction problem by fitting the proposed image model to a corrupted observed image and derive an algorithm to solve it. Our experiments show that the proposed image model is effective for various self-supervised image reconstruction tasks, such as image inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, and denoising.

> Various automated program repair (APR) techniques have been proposed to fix bugs automatically in the last decade. Although recent researches have made significant progress on the effectiveness and efficiency, it is still unclear how APR techniques perform with human intervention in a real debugging scenario. To bridge this gap, we conduct an extensive study to compare three state-of-the-art APR tools with manual program repair, and further investigate whether the assistance of APR tools (i.e., repair reports) can improve manual program repair. To that end, we recruit 20 participants for a controlled experiment, resulting in a total of 160 manual repair tasks and a questionnaire survey. The experiment reveals several notable observations that (1) manual program repair may be influenced by the frequency of repair actions sometimes; (2) APR tools are more efficient in terms of debugging time, while manual program repair tends to generate a correct patch with fewer attempts; (3) APR tools can further improve manual program repair regarding the number of correctly-fixed bugs, while there exists a negative impact on the patch correctness; (4) participants are used to consuming more time to identify incorrect patches, while they are still misguided easily; (5) participants are positive about the tools' repair performance, while they generally lack confidence about the usability in practice. Besides, we provide some guidelines for improving the usability of APR tools (e.g., the misleading information in reports and the observation of feedback).

<summary>2022-03-12 04:48:12 - The Principle of Diversity: Training Stronger Vision Transformers Calls for Reducing All Levels of Redundancy</summary>

- *Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu Zhang, Yu Cheng, Ahmed Awadallah, Zhangyang Wang*

- `2203.06345v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06345v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06345v1)

> Vision transformers (ViTs) have gained increasing popularity as they are commonly believed to own higher modeling capacity and representation flexibility, than traditional convolutional networks. However, it is questionable whether such potential has been fully unleashed in practice, as the learned ViTs often suffer from over-smoothening, yielding likely redundant models. Recent works made preliminary attempts to identify and alleviate such redundancy, e.g., via regularizing embedding similarity or re-injecting convolution-like structures. However, a "head-to-toe assessment" regarding the extent of redundancy in ViTs, and how much we could gain by thoroughly mitigating such, has been absent for this field. This paper, for the first time, systematically studies the ubiquitous existence of redundancy at all three levels: patch embedding, attention map, and weight space. In view of them, we advocate a principle of diversity for training ViTs, by presenting corresponding regularizers that encourage the representation diversity and coverage at each of those levels, that enabling capturing more discriminative information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet with a number of ViT backbones validate the effectiveness of our proposals, largely eliminating the observed ViT redundancy and significantly boosting the model generalization. For example, our diversified DeiT obtains 0.70%~1.76% accuracy boosts on ImageNet with highly reduced similarity. Our codes are fully available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Diverse-ViT.

> Most semantic segmentation approaches of Hyperspectral images (HSIs) use and require preprocessing steps in the form of patching to accurately classify diversified land cover in remotely sensed images. These approaches use patching to incorporate the rich neighborhood information in images and exploit the simplicity and segmentability of the most common HSI datasets. In contrast, most landmasses in the world consist of overlapping and diffused classes, making neighborhood information weaker than what is seen in common HSI datasets. To combat this issue and generalize the segmentation models to more complex and diverse HSI datasets, in this work, we propose our novel flagship model: Clustering Ensemble U-Net (CEU-Net). CEU-Net uses the ensemble method to combine spectral information extracted from convolutional neural network (CNN) training on a cluster of landscape pixels. Our CEU-Net model outperforms existing state-of-the-art HSI semantic segmentation methods and gets competitive performance with and without patching when compared to baseline models. We highlight CEU-Net's high performance across Botswana, KSC, and Salinas datasets compared to HybridSN and AeroRIT methods.

> Anomaly detection is commonly pursued as a one-class classification problem, where models can only learn from normal training samples, while being evaluated on both normal and abnormal test samples. Among the successful approaches for anomaly detection, a distinguished category of methods relies on predicting masked information (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and leveraging the reconstruction error with respect to the masked information as an abnormality score. Different from related methods, we propose to integrate the reconstruction-based functionality into a novel self-supervised predictive architectural building block. The proposed self-supervised block is generic and can easily be incorporated into various state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Our block starts with a convolutional layer with dilated filters, where the center area of the receptive field is masked. The resulting activation maps are passed through a channel attention module. Our block is equipped with a loss that minimizes the reconstruction error with respect to the masked area in the receptive field. We demonstrate the generality of our block by integrating it into several state-of-the-art frameworks for anomaly detection on image and video, providing empirical evidence that shows considerable performance improvements on MVTec AD, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech. We release our code as open source at https://github.com/ristea/sspcab.

> A major limitation in applying deep learning to artificial intelligence (AI) systems is the scarcity of high-quality curated datasets. We investigate strong augmentation based self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to address this problem. Using breast cancer detection as an example, we first identify a mammogram-specific transformation paradigm and then systematically compare four recent SSL methods representing a diversity of approaches. We develop a method to convert a pretrained model from making predictions on uniformly tiled patches to whole images, and an attention-based pooling method that improves the classification performance. We found that the best SSL model substantially outperformed the baseline supervised model. The best SSL model also improved the data efficiency of sample labeling by nearly 4-fold and was highly transferrable from one dataset to another. SSL represents a major breakthrough in computer vision and may help the AI for medical imaging field to shift away from supervised learning and dependency on scarce labels.

<summary>2022-03-16 05:20:29 - SHIELD: Defending Textual Neural Networks against Multiple Black-Box Adversarial Attacks with Stochastic Multi-Expert Patcher</summary>

- *Thai Le, Noseong Park, Dongwon Lee*

- `2011.08908v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08908v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08908v2)

> Even though several methods have proposed to defend textual neural network (NN) models against black-box adversarial attacks, they often defend against a specific text perturbation strategy and/or require re-training the models from scratch. This leads to a lack of generalization in practice and redundant computation. In particular, the state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) require great time and computation resources. By borrowing an idea from software engineering, in order to address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm, SHIELD, which modifies and re-trains only the last layer of a textual NN, and thus it "patches" and "transforms" the NN into a stochastic weighted ensemble of multi-expert prediction heads. Considering that most of current black-box attacks rely on iterative search mechanisms to optimize their adversarial perturbations, SHIELD confuses the attackers by automatically utilizing different weighted ensembles of predictors depending on the input. In other words, SHIELD breaks a fundamental assumption of the attack, which is a victim NN model remains constant during an attack. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that all of CNN, RNN, BERT, and RoBERTa-based textual NNs, once patched by SHIELD, exhibit a relative enhancement of 15%--70% in accuracy on average against 14 different black-box attacks, outperforming 6 defensive baselines across 3 public datasets. All codes are to be released.

> Patch attacks, one of the most threatening forms of physical attack in adversarial examples, can lead networks to induce misclassification by modifying pixels arbitrarily in a continuous region. Certifiable patch defense can guarantee robustness that the classifier is not affected by patch attacks. Existing certifiable patch defenses sacrifice the clean accuracy of classifiers and only obtain a low certified accuracy on toy datasets. Furthermore, the clean and certified accuracy of these methods is still significantly lower than the accuracy of normal classification networks, which limits their application in practice. To move towards a practical certifiable patch defense, we introduce Vision Transformer (ViT) into the framework of Derandomized Smoothing (DS). Specifically, we propose a progressive smoothed image modeling task to train Vision Transformer, which can capture the more discriminable local context of an image while preserving the global semantic information. For efficient inference and deployment in the real world, we innovatively reconstruct the global self-attention structure of the original ViT into isolated band unit self-attention. On ImageNet, under 2% area patch attacks our method achieves 41.70% certified accuracy, a nearly 1-fold increase over the previous best method (26.00%). Simultaneously, our method achieves 78.58% clean accuracy, which is quite close to the normal ResNet-101 accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains state-of-the-art clean and certified accuracy with inferring efficiently on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

> Towards predicting patch correctness in APR, we propose a simple, but novel hypothesis on how the link between the patch behaviour and failing test specifications can be drawn: similar failing test cases should require similar patches. We then propose BATS, an unsupervised learning-based system to predict patch correctness by checking patch Behaviour Against failing Test Specification. BATS exploits deep representation learning models for code and patches: for a given failing test case, the yielded embedding is used to compute similarity metrics in the search for historical similar test cases in order to identify the associated applied patches, which are then used as a proxy for assessing generated patch correctness. Experimentally, we first validate our hypothesis by assessing whether ground-truth developer patches cluster together in the same way that their associated failing test cases are clustered. Then, after collecting a large dataset of 1278 plausible patches (written by developers or generated by some 32 APR tools), we use BATS to predict correctness: BATS achieves an AUC between 0.557 to 0.718 and a recall between 0.562 and 0.854 in identifying correct patches. Compared against previous work, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art performance in patch correctness prediction, without the need for large labeled patch datasets in contrast with prior machine learning-based approaches. While BATS is constrained by the availability of similar test cases, we show that it can still be complementary to existing approaches: used in conjunction with a recent approach implementing supervised learning, BATS improves the overall recall in detecting correct patches. We finally show that BATS can be complementary to the state-of-the-art PATCH-SIM dynamic approach of identifying the correct patches for APR tools.

> Previous work on multimodal machine translation (MMT) has focused on the way of incorporating vision features into translation but little attention is on the quality of vision models. In this work, we investigate the impact of vision models on MMT. Given the fact that Transformer is becoming popular in computer vision, we experiment with various strong models (such as Vision Transformer) and enhanced features (such as object-detection and image captioning). We develop a selective attention model to study the patch-level contribution of an image in MMT. On detailed probing tasks, we find that stronger vision models are helpful for learning translation from the visual modality. Our results also suggest the need of carefully examining MMT models, especially when current benchmarks are small-scale and biased.

> Background: Cervical cancer seriously affects the health of the female reproductive system. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) emerged as a non-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical disease detection. However, OCT image annotation is knowledge-intensive and time-consuming, which impedes the training process of deep-learning-based classification models. Purpose: This study aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) approach to classifying in-vivo cervical OCT images based on self-supervised learning. Methods: In addition to high-level semantic features extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed CADx approach leverages unlabeled cervical OCT images' texture features learned by contrastive texture learning. We conducted ten-fold cross-validation on the OCT image dataset from a multi-center clinical study on 733 patients from China. Results: In a binary classification task for detecting high-risk diseases, including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and cervical cancer, our method achieved an area-under-the-curve value of 0.9798 plus or minus 0.0157 with a sensitivity of 91.17 plus or minus 4.99% and a specificity of 93.96 plus or minus 4.72% for OCT image patches; also, it outperformed two out of four medical experts on the test set. Furthermore, our method achieved a 91.53% sensitivity and 97.37% specificity on an external validation dataset containing 287 3D OCT volumes from 118 Chinese patients in a new hospital using a cross-shaped threshold voting strategy. Conclusions: The proposed contrastive-learning-based CADx method outperformed the end-to-end CNN models and provided better interpretability based on texture features, which holds great potential to be used in the clinical protocol of "see-and-treat."

> Machine Learning-based techniques have shown success in cyber intelligence. However, they are increasingly becoming targets of sophisticated data-driven adversarial attacks resulting in misprediction, eroding their ability to detect threats on network devices. In this paper, we present AdIoTack, a system that highlights vulnerabilities of decision trees against adversarial attacks, helping cybersecurity teams quantify and refine the resilience of their trained models for monitoring IoT networks. To assess the model for the worst-case scenario, AdIoTack performs white-box adversarial learning to launch successful volumetric attacks that decision tree ensemble models cannot flag. Our first contribution is to develop a white-box algorithm that takes a trained decision tree ensemble model and the profile of an intended network-based attack on a victim class as inputs. It then automatically generates recipes that specify certain packets on top of the indented attack packets (less than 15% overhead) that together can bypass the inference model unnoticed. We ensure that the generated attack instances are feasible for launching on IP networks and effective in their volumetric impact. Our second contribution develops a method to monitor the network behavior of connected devices actively, inject adversarial traffic (when feasible) on behalf of a victim IoT device, and successfully launch the intended attack. Our third contribution prototypes AdIoTack and validates its efficacy on a testbed consisting of a handful of real IoT devices monitored by a trained inference model. We demonstrate how the model detects all non-adversarial volumetric attacks on IoT devices while missing many adversarial ones. The fourth contribution develops systematic methods for applying patches to trained decision tree ensemble models, improving their resilience against adversarial volumetric attacks.

> Consistency is one of the keys to maintainable source code and hence a successful software project. We propose a novel method of extracting the intent of programmers from source code of a large project (~300kLOC) and checking the semantic consistency of its variable names. Our system learns a project-specific naming convention for variables based on its role solely from source code, and suggest alternatives when it violates its internal consistency. The system can also show the reasoning why a certain variable should be named in a specific way. The system does not rely on any external knowledge. We applied our method to 12 open-source projects and evaluated its results with human reviewers. Our system proposed alternative variable names for 416 out of 1080 (39%) instances that are considered better than ones originally used by the developers. Based on the results, we created patches to correct the inconsistent names and sent them to its developers. Three open-source projects adopted it.

> The empirical success of deep convolutional networks on tasks involving high-dimensional data such as images or audio suggests that they can efficiently approximate certain functions that are well-suited for such tasks. In this paper, we study this through the lens of kernel methods, by considering simple hierarchical kernels with two or three convolution and pooling layers, inspired by convolutional kernel networks. These achieve good empirical performance on standard vision datasets, while providing a precise description of their functional space that yields new insights on their inductive bias. We show that the RKHS consists of additive models of interaction terms between patches, and that its norm encourages spatial similarities between these terms through pooling layers. We then provide generalization bounds which illustrate how pooling and patches yield improved sample complexity guarantees when the target function presents such regularities.

> Existing neural style transfer methods require reference style images to transfer texture information of style images to content images. However, in many practical situations, users may not have reference style images but still be interested in transferring styles by just imagining them. In order to deal with such applications, we propose a new framework that enables a style transfer `without' a style image, but only with a text description of the desired style. Using the pre-trained text-image embedding model of CLIP, we demonstrate the modulation of the style of content images only with a single text condition. Specifically, we propose a patch-wise text-image matching loss with multiview augmentations for realistic texture transfer. Extensive experimental results confirmed the successful image style transfer with realistic textures that reflect semantic query texts.

> Understanding a person's behavior from their 3D motion is a fundamental problem in computer vision with many applications. An important component of this problem is 3D Temporal Action Localization (3D-TAL), which involves recognizing what actions a person is performing, and when. State-of-the-art 3D-TAL methods employ a two-stage approach in which the action span detection task and the action recognition task are implemented as a cascade. This approach, however, limits the possibility of error-correction. In contrast, we propose LocATe, an end-to-end approach that jointly localizes and recognizes actions in a 3D sequence. Further, unlike existing autoregressive models that focus on modeling the local context in a sequence, LocATe's transformer model is capable of capturing long-term correlations between actions in a sequence. Unlike transformer-based object-detection and classification models which consider image or patch features as input, the input in 3D-TAL is a long sequence of highly correlated frames. To handle the high-dimensional input, we implement an effective input representation, and overcome the diffuse attention across long time horizons by introducing sparse attention in the model. LocATe outperforms previous approaches on the existing PKU-MMD 3D-TAL benchmark (mAP=93.2%). Finally, we argue that benchmark datasets are most useful where there is clear room for performance improvement. To that end, we introduce a new, challenging, and more realistic benchmark dataset, BABEL-TAL-20 (BT20), where the performance of state-of-the-art methods is significantly worse. The dataset and code for the method will be available for research purposes.

> Image anomaly detection problems aim to determine whether an image is abnormal, and to detect anomalous areas. These methods are actively used in various fields such as manufacturing, medical care, and intelligent information. Encoder-decoder structures have been widely used in the field of anomaly detection because they can easily learn normal patterns in an unsupervised learning environment and calculate a score to identify abnormalities through a reconstruction error indicating the difference between input and reconstructed images. Therefore, current image anomaly detection methods have commonly used convolutional encoder-decoders to extract normal information through the local features of images. However, they are limited in that only local features of the image can be utilized when constructing a normal representation owing to the characteristics of convolution operations using a filter of fixed size. Therefore, we propose a vision transformer-based encoder-decoder model, named AnoViT, designed to reflect normal information by additionally learning the global relationship between image patches, which is capable of both image anomaly detection and localization. The proposed approach constructs a feature map that maintains the existing location information of individual patches by using the embeddings of all patches passed through multiple self-attention layers. The proposed AnoViT model performed better than the convolution-based model on three benchmark datasets. In MVTecAD, which is a representative benchmark dataset for anomaly localization, it showed improved results on 10 out of 15 classes compared with the baseline. Furthermore, the proposed method showed good performance regardless of the class and type of the anomalous area when localization results were evaluated qualitatively.

> Visual grounding, i.e., localizing objects in images according to natural language queries, is an important topic in visual language understanding. The most effective approaches for this task are based on deep learning, which generally require expensive manually labeled image-query or patch-query pairs. To eliminate the heavy dependence on human annotations, we present a novel method, named Pseudo-Q, to automatically generate pseudo language queries for supervised training. Our method leverages an off-the-shelf object detector to identify visual objects from unlabeled images, and then language queries for these objects are obtained in an unsupervised fashion with a pseudo-query generation module. Then, we design a task-related query prompt module to specifically tailor generated pseudo language queries for visual grounding tasks. Further, in order to fully capture the contextual relationships between images and language queries, we develop a visual-language model equipped with multi-level cross-modality attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method has two notable benefits: (1) it can reduce human annotation costs significantly, e.g., 31% on RefCOCO without degrading original model's performance under the fully supervised setting, and (2) without bells and whistles, it achieves superior or comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised visual grounding methods on all the five datasets we have experimented.

> Non-line-of-sight reconstruction (NLoS) is a novel indirect imaging modality that aims to recover objects or scene parts outside the field of view from measurements of light that is indirectly scattered off a directly visible, diffuse wall. Despite recent advances in acquisition and reconstruction techniques, the well-posedness of the problem at large, and the recoverability of objects and their shapes in particular, remains an open question. The commonly employed Fermat path criterion is rather conservative with this regard, as it classifies some surfaces as unrecoverable, although they contribute to the signal.   In this paper, we use a simpler necessary criterion for an opaque surface patch to be recoverable. Such piece of surface must be directly visible from some point on the wall, and it must occlude the space behind itself. Inspired by recent advances in neural implicit representations, we devise a new representation and reconstruction technique for NLoS scenes that unifies the treatment of recoverability with the reconstruction itself. Our approach, which we validate on various synthetic and experimental datasets, exhibits interesting properties. Unlike memory-inefficient volumetric representations, ours allows to infer adaptively tessellated surfaces from time-of-flight measurements of moderate resolution. It can further recover features beyond the Fermat path criterion, and it is robust to significant amounts of self-occlusion. We believe that this is the first time that these properties have been achieved in one system that, as an additional benefit, is trainable and hence suited for data-driven approaches.

> Emerging ultra-low-power tiny scale computing devices in Cyber-Physical Systems %and Internet of Things (IoT) run on harvested energy, are intermittently powered, have limited computational capability, and perform sensing and actuation functions under the control of a dedicated firmware operating without the supervisory control of an operating system. Wirelessly updating or patching the firmware of such devices is inevitable. We consider the challenging problem of simultaneous and secure firmware updates or patching for a typical class of such devices -- Computational Radio Frequency Identification (CRFID) devices. We propose Wisecr, the first secure and simultaneous wireless code dissemination mechanism to multiple devices that prevent malicious code injection attacks and intellectual property (IP) theft, whilst enabling remote attestation of code installation. Importantly, Wisecr is engineered to comply with existing ISO compliant communication protocol standards employed by CRFID devices and systems. We comprehensively evaluate Wisecr's overhead, demonstrate its implementation over standards-compliant protocols, analyze its security and implement an end-to-end realization with popular CRFID devices -- the open-source code is released on GitHub.

> Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been increasingly used in the classification of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). However, MIL approaches for this specific classification problem still face unique challenges, particularly those related to small sample cohorts. In these, there are limited number of WSI slides (bags), while the resolution of a single WSI is huge, which leads to a large number of patches (instances) cropped from this slide. To address this issue, we propose to virtually enlarge the number of bags by introducing the concept of pseudo-bags, on which a double-tier MIL framework is built to effectively use the intrinsic features. Besides, we also contribute to deriving the instance probability under the framework of attention-based MIL, and utilize the derivation to help construct and analyze the proposed framework. The proposed method outperforms other latest methods on the CAMELYON-16 by substantially large margins, and is also better in performance on the TCGA lung cancer dataset. The proposed framework is ready to be extended for wider MIL applications. The code is available at: https://github.com/hrzhang1123/DTFD-MIL

> Automatic segmentation of vertebral bodies (VBs) and intervertebral discs (IVDs) in 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images is vital in diagnosing and treating spinal diseases. However, segmenting the VBs and IVDs simultaneously is not trivial. Moreover, problems exist, including blurry segmentation caused by anisotropy resolution, high computational cost, inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, and data imbalances. We proposed a two-stage algorithm, named semi-supervised hybrid spine network (SSHSNet), to address these problems by achieving accurate simultaneous VB and IVD segmentation. In the first stage, we constructed a 2D semi-supervised DeepLabv3+ by using cross pseudo supervision to obtain intra-slice features and coarse segmentation. In the second stage, a 3D full-resolution patch-based DeepLabv3+ was built. This model can be used to extract inter-slice information and combine the coarse segmentation and intra-slice features provided from the first stage. Moreover, a cross tri-attention module was applied to compensate for the loss of inter-slice and intra-slice information separately generated from 2D and 3D networks, thereby improving feature representation ability and achieving satisfactory segmentation results. The proposed SSHSNet was validated on a publicly available spine MR image dataset, and remarkable segmentation performance was achieved. Moreover, results show that the proposed method has great potential in dealing with the data imbalance problem. Based on previous reports, few studies have incorporated a semi-supervised learning strategy with a cross attention mechanism for spine segmentation. Therefore, the proposed method may provide a useful tool for spine segmentation and aid clinically in spinal disease diagnoses and treatments.

> It is well-known that the most existing machine learning (ML)-based safety-critical applications are vulnerable to carefully crafted input instances called adversarial examples (AXs). An adversary can conveniently attack these target systems from digital as well as physical worlds. This paper aims to the generation of robust physical AXs against face recognition systems. We present a novel smoothness loss function and a patch-noise combo attack for realizing powerful physical AXs. The smoothness loss interjects the concept of delayed constraints during the attack generation process, thereby causing better handling of optimization complexity and smoother AXs for the physical domain. The patch-noise combo attack combines patch noise and imperceptibly small noises from different distributions to generate powerful registration-based physical AXs. An extensive experimental analysis found that our smoothness loss results in robust and more transferable digital and physical AXs than the conventional techniques. Notably, our smoothness loss results in a 1.17 and 1.97 times better mean attack success rate (ASR) in physical white-box and black-box attacks, respectively. Our patch-noise combo attack furthers the performance gains and results in 2.39 and 4.74 times higher mean ASR than conventional technique in physical world white-box and black-box attacks, respectively.

> Automated Program Repair (APR) helps improve the efficiency of software development and maintenance. Recent APR techniques use deep learning, particularly the encoder-decoder architecture, to generate patches. Though existing DL-based APR approaches have proposed different encoder architectures, the decoder remains to be the standard one, which generates a sequence of tokens one by one to replace the faulty statement. This decoder has multiple limitations: 1) allowing to generate syntactically incorrect programs, 2) inefficiently representing small edits, and 3) not being able to generate project-specific identifiers.   In this paper, we propose Recoder, a syntax-guided edit decoder with placeholder generation. Recoder is novel in multiple aspects: 1) Recoder generates edits rather than modified code, allowing efficient representation of small edits; 2) Recoder is syntax-guided, with the novel provider/decider architecture to ensure the syntactic correctness of the patched program and accurate generation; 3) Recoder generates placeholders that could be instantiated as project-specific identifiers later.   We conduct experiments to evaluate Recoder on 395 bugs from Defects4J v1.2 and 420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0. Our results show that Recoder repairs 53 bugs on Defects4J v1.2, which achieves 21.4% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach for single-hunk bugs (TBar). Importantly, to our knowledge, Recoder is the first DL-based APR approach that has outperformed the traditional APR approaches on this dataset. Furthermore, Recoder also repairs 19 bugs on the additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, which is 137.5% more than TBar (8 bugs) and 850% more than SimFix (2 bugs). This result suggests that Recoder has better generalizability than existing APR approaches.

> Precipitation nowcasting is of great importance for weather forecast users, for activities ranging from outdoor activities and sports competitions to airport traffic management. In contrast to long-term precipitation forecasts which are traditionally obtained from numerical models, precipitation nowcasting needs to be very fast. It is therefore more challenging to obtain because of this time constraint. Recently, many machine learning based methods had been proposed. We propose the use three popular deep learning models (U-net, ConvLSTM and SVG-LP) trained on two-dimensional precipitation maps for precipitation nowcasting. We proposed an algorithm for patch extraction to obtain high resolution precipitation maps. We proposed a loss function to solve the blurry image issue and to reduce the influence of zero value pixels in precipitation maps.

> Face identification (FI) is ubiquitous and drives many high-stake decisions made by law enforcement. State-of-the-art FI approaches compare two images by taking the cosine similarity between their image embeddings. Yet, such an approach suffers from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to new types of images (e.g., when a query face is masked, cropped, or rotated) not included in the training set or the gallery. Here, we propose a re-ranking approach that compares two faces using the Earth Mover's Distance on the deep, spatial features of image patches. Our extra comparison stage explicitly examines image similarity at a fine-grained level (e.g., eyes to eyes) and is more robust to OOD perturbations and occlusions than traditional FI. Interestingly, without finetuning feature extractors, our method consistently improves the accuracy on all tested OOD queries: masked, cropped, rotated, and adversarial while obtaining similar results on in-distribution images.

> Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are becoming increasingly popular for the reconstruction of high-resolution turbulent flows (aka super-resolution). However, current DL approaches perform spatially uniform super-resolution - a key performance limiter for scalability of DL-based surrogates for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).   To address the above challenge, we introduce NUNet, a deep learning-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for non-uniform super-resolution of turbulent flows. NUNet divides the input low-resolution flow field into patches, scores each patch, and predicts their target resolution. As a result, it outputs a spatially non-uniform flow field, adaptively refining regions of the fluid domain to achieve the target accuracy. We train NUNet with Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions from three different canonical flows, namely turbulent channel flow, flat plate, and flow around ellipses. NUNet shows remarkable discerning properties, refining areas with complex flow features, such as near-wall domains and the wake region in flow around solid bodies, while leaving areas with smooth variations (such as the freestream) in the low-precision range. Hence, NUNet demonstrates an excellent qualitative and quantitative alignment with the traditional OpenFOAM AMR solver. Moreover, it reaches the same convergence guarantees as the AMR solver while accelerating it by 3.2-5.5x, including unseen-during-training geometries and boundary conditions, demonstrating its generalization capacities. Due to NUNet's ability to super-resolve only regions of interest, it predicts the same target 1024x1024 spatial resolution 7-28.5x faster than state-of-the-art DL methods and reduces the memory usage by 4.4-7.65x, showcasing improved scalability.

> This paper proposes JiGAN, a GAN-based method for solving Jigsaw puzzles with eroded or missing borders. Missing borders is a common real-world situation, for example, when dealing with the reconstruction of broken artifacts or ruined frescoes. In this particular condition, the puzzle's pieces do not align perfectly due to the borders' gaps; in this situation, the patches' direct match is unfeasible due to the lack of color and line continuations. JiGAN, is a two-steps procedure that tackles this issue: first, we repair the eroded borders with a GAN-based image extension model and measure the alignment affinity between pieces; then, we solve the puzzle with the relaxation labeling algorithm to enforce consistency in pieces positioning, hence, reconstructing the puzzle. We test the method on a large dataset of small puzzles and on three commonly used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

> In this work we demonstrate the vulnerability of vision transformers (ViTs) to gradient-based inversion attacks. During this attack, the original data batch is reconstructed given model weights and the corresponding gradients. We introduce a method, named GradViT, that optimizes random noise into naturally looking images via an iterative process. The optimization objective consists of (i) a loss on matching the gradients, (ii) image prior in the form of distance to batch-normalization statistics of a pretrained CNN model, and (iii) a total variation regularization on patches to guide correct recovery locations. We propose a unique loss scheduling function to overcome local minima during optimization. We evaluate GadViT on ImageNet1K and MS-Celeb-1M datasets, and observe unprecedentedly high fidelity and closeness to the original (hidden) data. During the analysis we find that vision transformers are significantly more vulnerable than previously studied CNNs due to the presence of the attention mechanism. Our method demonstrates new state-of-the-art results for gradient inversion in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Project page at https://gradvit.github.io/.

> Multimodal contrastive learning methods like CLIP train on noisy and uncurated training datasets. This is cheaper than labeling datasets manually, and even improves out-of-distribution robustness. We show that this practice makes backdoor and poisoning attacks a significant threat. By poisoning just 0.01% of a dataset (e.g., just 300 images of the 3 million-example Conceptual Captions dataset), we can cause the model to misclassify test images by overlaying a small patch. Targeted poisoning attacks, whereby the model misclassifies a particular test input with an adversarially-desired label, are even easier requiring control of 0.0001% of the dataset (e.g., just three out of the 3 million images). Our attacks call into question whether training on noisy and uncurated Internet scrapes is desirable.

> Automatic segmentation of lung lesions associated with COVID-19 in CT images requires large amount of annotated volumes. Annotations mandate expert knowledge and are time-intensive to obtain through fully manual segmentation methods. Additionally, lung lesions have large inter-patient variations, with some pathologies having similar visual appearance as healthy lung tissues. This poses a challenge when applying existing semi-automatic interactive segmentation techniques for data labelling. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can be learned online while the annotator provides scribble-based interaction. To accelerate learning from only the samples labelled through user-interactions, a patch-based approach is used for training the network. Moreover, we use weighted cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance that may result from user-interactions. During online inference, the learned network is applied to the whole input volume using a fully convolutional approach. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art using synthetic scribbles and show that it outperforms existing methods on the task of annotating lung lesions associated with COVID-19, achieving 16% higher Dice score while reducing execution time by 3$\times$ and requiring 9000 lesser scribbles-based labelled voxels. Due to the online learning aspect, our approach adapts quickly to user input, resulting in high quality segmentation labels.

> Implicit neural networks have been successfully used for surface reconstruction from point clouds. However, many of them face scalability issues as they encode the isosurface function of a whole object or scene into a single latent vector. To overcome this limitation, a few approaches infer latent vectors on a coarse regular 3D grid or on 3D patches, and interpolate them to answer occupancy queries. In doing so, they loose the direct connection with the input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information uniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the surface. Besides, relying on fixed patch sizes may require discretization tuning. To address these issues, we propose to use point cloud convolutions and compute latent vectors at each input point. We then perform a learning-based interpolation on nearest neighbors using inferred weights. Experiments on both object and scene datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms other methods on most classical metrics, producing finer details and better reconstructing thinner volumes. The code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/POCO.

> Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition require large amounts of training samples and usually benefit from data augmentation. This paper proposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by composing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new samples are assigned label scores that are proportional to the number of patches borrowed from each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to regularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image levels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior transfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although PatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing, we explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to jointly discover optimal grid-like patterns and image pairings. For this purpose, we conceive a fitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each possible choice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91), CIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16).

> We evaluate the performance of federated learning (FL) in developing deep learning models for analysis of digitized tissue sections. A classification application was considered as the example use case, on quantifiying the distribution of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes within whole slide images (WSIs). A deep learning classification model was trained using 50*50 square micron patches extracted from the WSIs. We simulated a FL environment in which a dataset, generated from WSIs of cancer from numerous anatomical sites available by The Cancer Genome Atlas repository, is partitioned in 8 different nodes. Our results show that the model trained with the federated training approach achieves similar performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to that of a model trained with all the training data pooled at a centralized location. Our study shows that FL has tremendous potential for enabling development of more robust and accurate models for histopathology image analysis without having to collect large and diverse training data at a single location.

The dataset contains RGB and multispectral orthophotos from which about 14,000 individual plant coordinates are derived and provided. The coordinates enable the dataset users the extraction of complete and incomplete time series of image patches showing individual plants. The dataset contains collected phenotypic traits of 740 plants, including the developmental stage as well as plant and cauliflower size. As the harvestable product is completely covered by leaves, plant IDs and coordinates are provided to extract image pairs of plants pre and post defoliation, to facilitate estimations of cauliflower head size. Moreover, the dataset contains pixel-accurate leaf and plant instance segmentations, as well as stem annotations to address tasks like classification, detection, segmentation, instance segmentation, and similar computer vision tasks. The dataset aims to foster the development and evaluation of machine learning approaches. It specifically focuses on the analysis of growth and development of cauliflower and the derivation of phenotypic traits to foster the development of automation in agriculture. Two baseline results of instance segmentation at plant and leaf level based on the labeled instance segmentation data are presented. The entire data set is publicly available.

> We propose a frictionless contact formulation for isogeometric analysis, which combines a collocated formulation for the contact surfaces with a standard Galerkin treatment of the bulk. We denote it as isogeometric Collocated Contact Surface (CCS) formulation. The approach is based on a simple pointwise enforcement of the contact constraints, performed in this study with the penalty method. Unlike pointwise (node-to-surface or point-to-surface) contact algorithms in the Galerkin framework, the CCS formulation passes the contact patch test to machine precision by naturally exploiting the favorable properties of isogeometric collocation. Compared with approaches where the discretization of both bulk and contact surfaces is based on collocation, the CCS approach does not need enhancements to remove oscillations for highly non-uniform meshes. With respect to integral contact approaches, the CCS algorithm is less expensive, easier to code and can be added to a pre-existing isogeometric analysis code with minimal effort. Numerical examples in both small and large deformations are investigated to compare the CCS approach with some available contact formulations and to demonstrate its accuracy.

> In this paper, we introduce a novel visual representation learning which relies on a handful of adaptively learned tokens, and which is applicable to both image and video understanding tasks. Instead of relying on hand-designed splitting strategies to obtain visual tokens and processing a large number of densely sampled patches for attention, our approach learns to mine important tokens in visual data. This results in efficiently and effectively finding a few important visual tokens and enables modeling of pairwise attention between such tokens, over a longer temporal horizon for videos, or the spatial content in images. Our experiments demonstrate strong performance on several challenging benchmarks for both image and video recognition tasks. Importantly, due to our tokens being adaptive, we accomplish competitive results at significantly reduced compute amount. We obtain comparable results to the state-of-the-arts on ImageNet while being computationally more efficient. We also confirm the effectiveness of the approach on multiple video datasets, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, Charades, and AViD.

> This paper studies the efficiency problem for visual transformers by excavating redundant calculation in given networks. The recent transformer architecture has demonstrated its effectiveness for achieving excellent performance on a series of computer vision tasks. However, similar to that of convolutional neural networks, the huge computational cost of vision transformers is still a severe issue. Considering that the attention mechanism aggregates different patches layer-by-layer, we present a novel patch slimming approach that discards useless patches in a top-down paradigm. We first identify the effective patches in the last layer and then use them to guide the patch selection process of previous layers. For each layer, the impact of a patch on the final output feature is approximated and patches with less impact will be removed. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the computational costs of vision transformers without affecting their performances. For example, over 45% FLOPs of the ViT-Ti model can be reduced with only 0.2% top-1 accuracy drop on the ImageNet dataset.

> We propose a pre-training strategy called Multi-modal Multi-task Masked Autoencoders (MultiMAE). It differs from standard Masked Autoencoding in two key aspects: I) it can optionally accept additional modalities of information in the input besides the RGB image (hence "multi-modal"), and II) its training objective accordingly includes predicting multiple outputs besides the RGB image (hence "multi-task").   We make use of masking (across image patches and input modalities) to make training MultiMAE tractable as well as to ensure cross-modality predictive coding is indeed learned by the network. We show this pre-training strategy leads to a flexible, simple, and efficient framework with improved transfer results to downstream tasks. In particular, the same exact pre-trained network can be flexibly used when additional information besides RGB images is available or when no information other than RGB is available - in all configurations yielding competitive to or significantly better results than the baselines. To avoid needing training datasets with multiple modalities and tasks, we train MultiMAE entirely using pseudo labeling, which makes the framework widely applicable to any RGB dataset.   The experiments are performed on multiple transfer tasks (image classification, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and datasets (ImageNet, ADE20K, Taskonomy, Hypersim, NYUv2). The results show an intriguingly impressive capability by the model in cross-modal/task predictive coding and transfer.

> Vision Transformers (ViT)s have recently become popular due to their outstanding modeling capabilities, in particular for capturing long-range information, and scalability to dataset and model sizes which has led to state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision and medical image analysis tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework consisting of two architectures, dubbed UNetFormer, with a 3D Swin Transformer-based encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transformer-based decoders. In the proposed model, the encoder is linked to the decoder via skip connections at five different resolutions with deep supervision. The design of proposed architecture allows for meeting a wide range of trade-off requirements between accuracy and computational cost. In addition, we present a methodology for self-supervised pre-training of the encoder backbone via learning to predict randomly masked volumetric tokens using contextual information of visible tokens. We pre-train our framework on a cohort of $5050$ CT images, gathered from publicly available CT datasets, and present a systematic investigation of various components such as masking ratio and patch size that affect the representation learning capability and performance of downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our pre-training approach by fine-tuning and testing our model on liver and liver tumor segmentation task using the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of various segmentation metrics. To demonstrate its generalizability, we train and test the model on BraTS 21 dataset for brain tumor segmentation using MRI images and outperform other methods in terms of Dice score.

> Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code that supports symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development tends to produce DL code that is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, less error-prone imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. While hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," the challenges in applying them in the real world are largely unknown. We conduct a data-driven analysis of challenges -- and resultant bugs -- involved in writing reliable yet performant imperative DL code by studying 250 open-source projects, consisting of 19.7 MLOC, along with 470 and 446 manually examined code patches and bug reports, respectively. The results indicate that hybridization: (i) is prone to API misuse, (ii) can result in performance degradation -- the opposite of its intention, and (iii) has limited application due to execution mode incompatibility. We put forth several recommendations, best practices, and anti-patterns for effectively hybridizing imperative DL code, potentially benefiting DL practitioners, API designers, tool developers, and educators.

> The widespread application of artificial intelligence in health research is currently hampered by limitations in data availability. Distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) and shared learning (SL) are introduced to solve this problem as well as data management and ownership issues with their different strengths and weaknesses. The recent proposal of federated split task-agnostic (FeSTA) learning tries to reconcile the distinct merits of FL and SL by enabling the multi-task collaboration between participants through Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, but they suffer from higher communication overhead. To address this, here we present a multi-task distributed learning using ViT with random patch permutation. Instead of using a CNN based head as in FeSTA, p-FeSTA adopts a randomly permuting simple patch embedder, improving the multi-task learning performance without sacrificing privacy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances the benefit of multi-task collaboration, communication efficiency, and privacy preservation, shedding light on practical multi-task distributed learning in the field of medical imaging.

> Source code repositories allow developers to manage multiple versions (or branches) of a software system. Pull-requests are used to modify a branch, and backporting is a regular activity used to port changes from a current development branch to other versions. In open-source software, backports are common and often need to be adapted by hand, which motivates us to explore backports and backporting challenges and strategies. In our exploration of 68,424 backports from 10 GitHub projects, we found that bug, test, document, and feature changes are commonly backported. We identified a number of backporting challenges, including that backports were inconsistently linked to their original pull-request (49%), that backports had incompatible code (13%), that backports failed to be accepted (10%), and that there were backporting delays (16 days to create, 5 days to merge). We identified some general strategies for addressing backporting issues. We also noted that backporting strategies depend on the project type and that further investigation is needed to determine their suitability. Furthermore, we created the first-ever backports dataset that can be used by other researchers and practitioners for investigating backports and backporting.

> The adversarial patch attack against image classification models aims to inject adversarially crafted pixels within a restricted image region (i.e., a patch) for inducing model misclassification. This attack can be realized in the physical world by printing and attaching the patch to the victim object; thus, it imposes a real-world threat to computer vision systems. To counter this threat, we design PatchCleanser as a certifiably robust defense against adversarial patches. In PatchCleanser, we perform two rounds of pixel masking on the input image to neutralize the effect of the adversarial patch. This image-space operation makes PatchCleanser compatible with any state-of-the-art image classifier for achieving high accuracy. Furthermore, we can prove that PatchCleanser will always predict the correct class labels on certain images against any adaptive white-box attacker within our threat model, achieving certified robustness. We extensively evaluate PatchCleanser on the ImageNet, ImageNette, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Flowers-102 datasets and demonstrate that our defense achieves similar clean accuracy as state-of-the-art classification models and also significantly improves certified robustness from prior works. Remarkably, PatchCleanser achieves 83.9% top-1 clean accuracy and 62.1% top-1 certified robust accuracy against a 2%-pixel square patch anywhere on the image for the 1000-class ImageNet dataset.

> Neural machine translation (NMT) architectures have achieved promising results for automatic program repair. Yet, they have the limitation of generating low-quality patches (e.g., not compilable patches). This is because the existing works only optimize a purely syntactic loss function based on characters and tokens without incorporating program-specific information during neural network weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel program repair model called RewardRepair. The core novelty of RewardRepair is to improve NMT-based program repair with a loss function based on program compilation and test execution information, rewarding the network to produce patches that compile and that do not overfit. We conduct several experiments to evaluate RewardRepair showing that it is feasible and effective to use compilation and test execution results to optimize the underlying neural repair model. RewardRepair correctly repairs 207 bugs over four benchmarks. we report on repair success for 121 bugs that are fixed for the first time in the literature. Also, RewardRepair produces up to 45.3% of compilable patches, an improvement over the 39% by the state-of-the-art.

> In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient CNN-based framework that leverages local and global context information for image denoising. Due to the limitations of convolution itself, the CNN-based method is generally unable to construct an effective and structured global feature representation, usually called the long-distance dependencies in the Transformer-based method. To tackle this problem, we introduce the matrix decomposition module(MD) in the network to establish the global context feature, comparable to the Transformer based method performance. Inspired by the design of multi-stage progressive restoration of U-shaped architecture, we further integrate the MD module into the multi-branches to acquire the relative global feature representation of the patch range at the current stage. Then, the stage input gradually rises to the overall scope and continuously improves the final feature. Experimental results on various image denoising datasets: SIDD, DND, and synthetic Gaussian noise datasets show that our model(SUMD) can produce comparable visual quality and accuracy results with Transformer-based methods.

> Recent works have shown that the computational efficiency of video recognition can be significantly improved by reducing the spatial redundancy. As a representative work, the adaptive focus method (AdaFocus) has achieved a favorable trade-off between accuracy and inference speed by dynamically identifying and attending to the informative regions in each video frame. However, AdaFocus requires a complicated three-stage training pipeline (involving reinforcement learning), leading to slow convergence and is unfriendly to practitioners. This work reformulates the training of AdaFocus as a simple one-stage algorithm by introducing a differentiable interpolation-based patch selection operation, enabling efficient end-to-end optimization. We further present an improved training scheme to address the issues introduced by the one-stage formulation, including the lack of supervision, input diversity and training stability. Moreover, a conditional-exit technique is proposed to perform temporal adaptive computation on top of AdaFocus without additional training. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2, and Jester) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the original AdaFocus and other competitive baselines, while being considerably more simple and efficient to train.

> Semantic versioning policy is widely used to indicate the level of changes in a package release. Unfortunately, there are many cases where developers do not respect the semantic versioning policy, leading to the breakage of dependent applications. To reduce such cases, we proposed using machine learning (ML) techniques to effectively predict the new release type, i.e., patch, minor, major, in order to properly determine the semantic versioning type. To perform our prediction, we mined and used a number of features about a release, such as the complexity of the changed code, change types, and development activities. We then used four ML classifiers. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ML classifiers, we conducted an empirical study on 31 JavaScript packages containing a total of approximately 6,260 releases. We started by extracting 41 release level features from historical data of packages' source code and repositories. Then, we used four machine learning classifiers, namely XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. We found that the XGBoost classifiers performed the best, achieving median ROC AUC values of 0.78, 0.69, and 0.74 for major, minor, and patch releases, respectively. We also found that features related to the change types in a release are the best predictors group of features in determining the semantic versioning type. Finally, we studied the generalizability of determining the semantic versioning type by applying cross-package validation. Our results showed that the general classifier achieved median ROC AUC values of 0.76, 0.69, and 0.75 for major, minor, and patch releases.

> Clone-and-own is a typical code reuse approach because of its simplicity and efficiency. Cloned software components are maintained independently by a new owner. These clone-and-own operations can be occurred sequentially, that is, cloned components can be cloned again and owned by other new owners on the supply chain. In general, code reuse is not documented well, consequently, appropriate changes like security patches cannot be propagated to descendant software projects. However, the OpenChain Project defined identifying and tracking source code reuses as responsibilities of FLOSS software staffs. Hence supporting source code reuse awareness is in a real need. This paper studies software reuse relations in FLOSS ecosystem. Technically, clone-and-own reuses of source code can be identified by file-level clone set detection. Since change histories are associated with files, we can determine origins and destinations in reusing across multiple software by considering times. By building software supply chain maps, we find that clone-and-own is prevalent in FLOSS development, and set of files are reused widely and repeatedly. These observations open up future challenges of maintaining and tracking global software genealogies.

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) take all the image patches as tokens and construct multi-head self-attention (MHSA) among them. Complete leverage of these image tokens brings redundant computations since not all the tokens are attentive in MHSA. Examples include that tokens containing semantically meaningless or distractive image backgrounds do not positively contribute to the ViT predictions. In this work, we propose to reorganize image tokens during the feed-forward process of ViT models, which is integrated into ViT during training. For each forward inference, we identify the attentive image tokens between MHSA and FFN (i.e., feed-forward network) modules, which is guided by the corresponding class token attention. Then, we reorganize image tokens by preserving attentive image tokens and fusing inattentive ones to expedite subsequent MHSA and FFN computations. To this end, our method EViT improves ViTs from two perspectives. First, under the same amount of input image tokens, our method reduces MHSA and FFN computation for efficient inference. For instance, the inference speed of DeiT-S is increased by 50% while its recognition accuracy is decreased by only 0.3% for ImageNet classification. Second, by maintaining the same computational cost, our method empowers ViTs to take more image tokens as input for recognition accuracy improvement, where the image tokens are from higher resolution images. An example is that we improve the recognition accuracy of DeiT-S by 1% for ImageNet classification at the same computational cost of a vanilla DeiT-S. Meanwhile, our method does not introduce more parameters to ViTs. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.

> Existing template and learning-based APR tools have successfully found patches for many benchmark faults. However, our analysis of existing results shows that omission faults pose a significant challenge to these techniques. For template based approaches, omission faults provide no location to apply templates to; for learning based approaches that formulate repair as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), omission faults similarly do not provide the faulty code to translate. To address these issues, we propose GLAD, a novel learning-based repair technique that specifically targets if-clause synthesis. GLAD does not require a faulty line as it is based on generative Language Models (LMs) instead of machine translation; consequently, it can repair omission faults. GLAD intelligently constrains the language model using a type-based grammar. Further, it efficiently reduces the validation cost by performing dynamic ranking of candidate patches using a debugger. Thanks to the shift from translation to synthesis, GLAD is highly orthogonal to existing techniques: GLAD can correctly fix 16 Defects4J v1.2 faults that previous NMT-based techniques could not, while maintaining a reasonable runtime cost, underscoring its utility as an APR tool and potential to complement existing tools in practice. An inspection of the bugs that GLAD fixes reveals that GLAD can quickly generate expressions that would be challenging for other techniques.

> We propose Masked Siamese Networks (MSN), a self-supervised learning framework for learning image representations. Our approach matches the representation of an image view containing randomly masked patches to the representation of the original unmasked image. This self-supervised pre-training strategy is particularly scalable when applied to Vision Transformers since only the unmasked patches are processed by the network. As a result, MSNs improve the scalability of joint-embedding architectures, while producing representations of a high semantic level that perform competitively on low-shot image classification. For instance, on ImageNet-1K, with only 5,000 annotated images, our base MSN model achieves 72.4% top-1 accuracy, and with 1% of ImageNet-1K labels, we achieve 75.7% top-1 accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised learning on this benchmark.

DC PSE is a collocation method that can be used to compute derivatives directly at nodal points, instead of by projection from Gauss points as is done in many finite element-based recovery techniques. The proposed method is truly meshless and does not require patches of elements to be defined, which makes it generally applicable to point clouds and arbitrary element topologies.

> Backdoor attacks insert malicious data into a training set so that, during inference time, it misclassifies inputs that have been patched with a backdoor trigger as the malware specified label. For backdoor attacks to bypass human inspection, it is essential that the injected data appear to be correctly labeled. The attacks with such property are often referred to as "clean-label attacks." Existing clean-label backdoor attacks require knowledge of the entire training set to be effective. Obtaining such knowledge is difficult or impossible because training data are often gathered from multiple sources (e.g., face images from different users). It remains a question whether backdoor attacks still present a real threat.   This paper provides an affirmative answer to this question by designing an algorithm to mount clean-label backdoor attacks based only on the knowledge of representative examples from the target class. With poisoning equal to or less than 0.5% of the target-class data and 0.05% of the training set, we can train a model to classify test examples from arbitrary classes into the target class when the examples are patched with a backdoor trigger. Our attack works well across datasets and models, even when the trigger presents in the physical world.   We explore the space of defenses and find that, surprisingly, our attack can evade the latest state-of-the-art defenses in their vanilla form, or after a simple twist, we can adapt to the downstream defenses. We study the cause of the intriguing effectiveness and find that because the trigger synthesized by our attack contains features as persistent as the original semantic features of the target class, any attempt to remove such triggers would inevitably hurt the model accuracy first.

> Early detection of breast cancer in mammography screening via deep-learning based computer-aided detection systems shows promising potential in improving the curability and mortality rates of breast cancer. However, many clinical centres are restricted in the amount and heterogeneity of available data to train such models to (i) achieve promising performance and to (ii) generalise well across acquisition protocols and domains. As sharing data between centres is restricted due to patient privacy concerns, we propose a potential solution: sharing trained generative models between centres as substitute for real patient data. In this work, we use three well known mammography datasets to simulate three different centres, where one centre receives the trained generator of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) from the two remaining centres in order to augment the size and heterogeneity of its training dataset. We evaluate the utility of this approach on mammography patch classification on the test set of the GAN-receiving centre using two different classification models, (a) a convolutional neural network and (b) a transformer neural network. Our experiments demonstrate that shared GANs notably increase the performance of both transformer and convolutional classification models and highlight this approach as a viable alternative to inter-centre data sharing.

> The tremendous success of Deep Learning (DL) has significantly boosted the number of open-sourced DL frameworks hosted on GitHub. Among others, performance and accuracy bugs are critical factors that affect the reputation of these DL frameworks, therefore understanding the practice of discovering and investigating them for DL is important. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study on the nature of reporting performance and accuracy bugs bugs for DL frameworks, aiming to improve our knowledge on this topic. Our study covers 10 most popular open-sourced DL frameworks on GitHub (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch), based on which we sample 664 representative performance and accuracy bugs bug reports out of a total population of 22,522. Through systematic analysis of these samples, our key findings are: (1) low speed is the primary reason that a performance bug related report is submitted but we see no consistent pattern for accuracy related ones; (2) most of the reports are about issues encountered in the training stage; (3) only a small proportion of the reports provide insufficient information to investigate; (4) the majority of the performance and accuracy bugs bug reports (from 69% to 100%) are not related to the actual bug or regarded as unclassified; (5) around 50% of the performance and accuracy bug reports, which indeed reveal bugs, are not resolved by direct patches. Deriving from the above, we discuss a set of actionable implications to the researchers, maintainers, and report submitters on this subject.

> Recent advances in deep learning, such as powerful generative models and joint text-image embeddings, have provided the computational creativity community with new tools, opening new perspectives for artistic pursuits. Text-to-image synthesis approaches that operate by generating images from text cues provide a case in point. These images are generated with a latent vector that is progressively refined to agree with text cues. To do so, patches are sampled within the generated image, and compared with the text prompts in the common text-image embedding space; The latent vector is then updated, using gradient descent, to reduce the mean (average) distance between these patches and text cues. While this approach provides artists with ample freedom to customize the overall appearance of images, through their choice in generative models, the reliance on a simple criterion (mean of distances) often causes mode collapse: The entire image is drawn to the average of all text cues, thereby losing their diversity. To address this issue, we propose using matching techniques found in the optimal transport (OT) literature, resulting in images that are able to reflect faithfully a wide diversity of prompts. We provide numerous illustrations showing that OT avoids some of the pitfalls arising from estimating vectors with mean distances, and demonstrate the capacity of our proposed method to perform better in experiments, qualitatively and quantitatively.

> The shift towards end-to-end deep learning has brought unprecedented advances in many areas of computer vision. However, deep neural networks are trained on images with resolutions that rarely exceed $1,000 \times 1,000$ pixels. The growing use of scanners that create images with extremely high resolutions (average can be $100,000 \times 100,000$ pixels) thereby presents novel challenges to the field. Most of the published methods preprocess high-resolution images into a set of smaller patches, imposing an a priori belief on the best properties of the extracted patches (magnification, field of view, location, etc.). Herein, we introduce Magnifying Networks (MagNets) as an alternative deep learning solution for gigapixel image analysis that does not rely on a preprocessing stage nor requires the processing of billions of pixels. MagNets can learn to dynamically retrieve any part of a gigapixel image, at any magnification level and field of view, in an end-to-end fashion with minimal ground truth (a single global, slide-level label). Our results on the publicly available Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 datasets corroborate to the effectiveness and efficiency of MagNets and the proposed optimization framework for whole slide image classification. Importantly, MagNets process far less patches from each slide than any of the existing approaches ($10$ to $300$ times less).

> Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) products in particular, are one of the largest sources of Earth Observation data. InSAR provides unique information on diverse geophysical processes and geology, and on the geotechnical properties of man-made structures. However, there are only a limited number of applications that exploit the abundance of InSAR data and deep learning methods to extract such knowledge. The main barrier has been the lack of a large curated and annotated InSAR dataset, which would be costly to create and would require an interdisciplinary team of experts experienced on InSAR data interpretation. In this work, we put the effort to create and make available the first of its kind, manually annotated dataset that consists of 19,919 individual Sentinel-1 interferograms acquired over 44 different volcanoes globally, which are split into 216,106 InSAR patches. The annotated dataset is designed to address different computer vision problems, including volcano state classification, semantic segmentation of ground deformation, detection and classification of atmospheric signals in InSAR imagery, interferogram captioning, text to InSAR generation, and InSAR image quality assessment.

> Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) aims to discriminate similar subcategories, whose main challenge is the large intraclass diversities and subtle inter-class differences. Existing FGVC methods usually select discriminant regions found by a trained model, which is prone to neglect other potential discriminant information. On the other hand, the massive interactions between the sequence of image patches in ViT make the resulting class-token contain lots of redundant information, which may also impacts FGVC performance. In this paper, we present a novel approach for FGVC, which can simultaneously make use of partial yet sufficient discriminative information in environmental cues and also compress the redundant information in class-token with respect to the target. Specifically, our model calculates the ratio of high-weight regions in a batch, adaptively adjusts the masking threshold and achieves moderate extraction of background information in the input space. Moreover, we also use the Information Bottleneck~(IB) approach to guide our network to learn a minimum sufficient representations in the feature space. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmark datasets verify that our approach can achieve outperforming performance than other state-of-the-art approaches and baseline models.

> Although robust PCA has been increasingly adopted to extract vessels from X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) images, challenging problems such as inefficient vessel-sparsity modelling, noisy and dynamic background artefacts, and high computational cost still remain unsolved. Therefore, we propose a novel robust PCA unrolling network with sparse feature selection for super-resolution XCA vessel imaging. Being embedded within a patch-wise spatiotemporal super-resolution framework that is built upon a pooling layer and a convolutional long short-term memory network, the proposed network can not only gradually prune complex vessel-like artefacts and noisy backgrounds in XCA during network training but also iteratively learn and select the high-level spatiotemporal semantic information of moving contrast agents flowing in the XCA-imaged vessels. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the imaging of the vessel network and its distal vessels, by restoring the intensity and geometry profiles of heterogeneous vessels against complex and dynamic backgrounds.

> Deep learning has become the mainstream methodological choice for analyzing and interpreting whole-slide digital pathology images (WSIs). It is commonly assumed that tumor regions carry most predictive information. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised clustering-based multiple-instance learning, and apply our method to develop deep-learning models for prediction of gene mutations using WSIs from three cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (CRC, LUAD, and HNSCC). We showed that unsupervised clustering of image patches could help identify predictive patches, exclude patches lack of predictive information, and therefore improve prediction on gene mutations in all three different cancer types, compared with the WSI based method without selection of image patches and models based on only tumor regions. Additionally, our proposed algorithm outperformed two recently published baseline algorithms leveraging unsupervised clustering to assist model prediction. The unsupervised-clustering-based approach for mutation prediction allows identification of the spatial regions related to mutation of a specific gene via the resolved probability scores, highlighting the heterogeneity of a predicted genotype in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, our study also demonstrated that selection of tumor regions of WSIs is not always the best way to identify patches for prediction of gene mutations, and other tissue types in the tumor micro-environment may provide better prediction ability for gene mutations than tumor tissues.

> The freeform architectural modeling process often involves two important stages: concept design and digital modeling. In the first stage, architects usually sketch the overall 3D shape and the panel layout on a physical or digital paper briefly. In the second stage, a digital 3D model is created using the sketch as a reference. The digital model needs to incorporate geometric requirements for its components, such as the planarity of panels due to consideration of construction costs, which can make the modeling process more challenging. In this work, we present a novel sketch-based system to bridge the concept design and digital modeling of freeform roof-like shapes represented as planar quadrilateral (PQ) meshes. Our system allows the user to sketch the surface boundary and contour lines under axonometric projection and supports the sketching of occluded regions. In addition, the user can sketch feature lines to provide directional guidance to the PQ mesh layout. Given the 2D sketch input, we propose a deep neural network to infer in real-time the underlying surface shape along with a dense conjugate direction field, both of which are used to extract the final PQ mesh. To train and validate our network, we generate a large synthetic dataset that mimics architect sketching of freeform quadrilateral patches. The effectiveness and usability of our system are demonstrated with quantitative and qualitative evaluation as well as user studies.

> The Stackelberg security game is played between a defender and an attacker, where the defender needs to allocate a limited amount of resources to multiple targets in order to minimize the loss due to adversarial attack by the attacker. While allowing targets to have different values, classic settings often assume uniform requirements to defend the targets. This enables existing results that study mixed strategies (randomized allocation algorithms) to adopt a compact representation of the mixed strategies.   In this work, we initiate the study of mixed strategies for the security games in which the targets can have different defending requirements. In contrast to the case of uniform defending requirement, for which an optimal mixed strategy can be computed efficiently, we show that computing the optimal mixed strategy is NP-hard for the general defending requirements setting. However, we show that strong upper and lower bounds for the optimal mixed strategy defending result can be derived. We propose an efficient close-to-optimal Patching algorithm that computes mixed strategies that use only few pure strategies. We also study the setting when the game is played on a network and resource sharing is enabled between neighboring targets. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in several large real-world datasets.

> Genetic improvement is a search technique that aims to improve a given acceptable solution to a problem. In this paper, we present the novel use of genetic improvement to find problem-specific optimized LLVM pass sequences. We develop a pass-level patch representation in the linear genetic programming framework, Shackleton, to evolve the modifications to be applied to the default optimization pass sequences. Our GI-evolved solution has a mean of 3.7% runtime improvement compared to the -O3 optimization level in the default code generation options which optimizes on runtime. The proposed GI method provides an automatic way to find a problem-specific optimization sequence that improves upon a general solution without any expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the GI feature in the Shackleton Framework and present our results.

> A variety of real-world applications rely on far future information to make decisions, thus calling for efficient and accurate long sequence multivariate time series forecasting. While recent attention-based forecasting models show strong abilities in capturing long-term dependencies, they still suffer from two key limitations. First, canonical self attention has a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the input time series length, thus falling short in efficiency. Second, different variables' time series often have distinct temporal dynamics, which existing studies fail to capture, as they use the same model parameter space, e.g., projection matrices, for all variables' time series, thus falling short in accuracy. To ensure high efficiency and accuracy, we propose Triformer, a triangular, variable-specific attention. (i) Linear complexity: we introduce a novel patch attention with linear complexity. When stacking multiple layers of the patch attentions, a triangular structure is proposed such that the layer sizes shrink exponentially, thus maintaining linear complexity. (ii) Variable-specific parameters: we propose a light-weight method to enable distinct sets of model parameters for different variables' time series to enhance accuracy without compromising efficiency and memory usage. Strong empirical evidence on four datasets from multiple domains justifies our design choices, and it demonstrates that Triformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. both accuracy and efficiency. This is an extended version of "Triformer: Triangular, Variable-Specific Attentions for Long Sequence Multivariate Time Series Forecasting", to appear in IJCAI 2022 [Cirstea et al., 2022a], including additional experimental results.

> The degree of malignancy of osteosarcoma and its tendency to metastasize/spread mainly depend on the pathological grade (determined by observing the morphology of the tumor under a microscope). The purpose of this study is to use artificial intelligence to classify osteosarcoma histological images and to assess tumor survival and necrosis, which will help doctors reduce their workload, improve the accuracy of osteosarcoma cancer detection, and make a better prognosis for patients. The study proposes a typical transformer image classification framework by integrating noise reduction convolutional autoencoder and feature cross fusion learning (NRCA-FCFL) to classify osteosarcoma histological images. Noise reduction convolutional autoencoder could well denoise histological images of osteosarcoma, resulting in more pure images for osteosarcoma classification. Moreover, we introduce feature cross fusion learning, which integrates two scale image patches, to sufficiently explore their interactions by using additional classification tokens. As a result, a refined fusion feature is generated, which is fed to the residual neural network for label predictions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the traditional and deep learning approaches on various evaluation metrics, with an accuracy of 99.17% to support osteosarcoma diagnosis.

> Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for various visual recognition tasks by patch-wise image tokenization followed by self-attention. However, the employment of self-attention modules results in a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on approximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have been made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this work shows that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual recognition. We further identify that their limitations are rooted in keeping the softmax self-attention during approximations. Specifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled dot-product between token feature vectors. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Based on this insight, for the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed. To remove softmax in self-attention, Gaussian kernel function is used to replace the dot-product similarity without further normalization. This enables a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. The robustness of the approximation is achieved by calculating its Moore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that our SOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. Crucially, with a linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.

> In this work, we consider the problem of learning a perception model for monocular robot navigation using few annotated images. Using a Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained with a label-free self-supervised method, we successfully train a coarse image segmentation model for the Duckietown environment using 70 training images. Our model performs coarse image segmentation at the 8x8 patch level, and the inference resolution can be adjusted to balance prediction granularity and real-time perception constraints. We study how best to adapt a ViT to our task and environment, and find that some lightweight architectures can yield good single-image segmentation at a usable frame rate, even on CPU. The resulting perception model is used as the backbone for a simple yet robust visual servoing agent, which we deploy on a differential drive mobile robot to perform two tasks: lane following and obstacle avoidance.

> Object detection plays a key role in many security-critical systems. Adversarial patch attacks, which are easy to implement in the physical world, pose a serious threat to state-of-the-art object detectors. Developing reliable defenses for object detectors against patch attacks is critical but severely understudied. In this paper, we propose Segment and Complete defense (SAC), a general framework for defending object detectors against patch attacks through detection and removal of adversarial patches. We first train a patch segmenter that outputs patch masks which provide pixel-level localization of adversarial patches. We then propose a self adversarial training algorithm to robustify the patch segmenter. In addition, we design a robust shape completion algorithm, which is guaranteed to remove the entire patch from the images if the outputs of the patch segmenter are within a certain Hamming distance of the ground-truth patch masks. Our experiments on COCO and xView datasets demonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness even under strong adaptive attacks with no reduction in performance on clean images, and generalizes well to unseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and unseen attack methods. Furthermore, we present the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which augments the APRICOT dataset with pixel-level annotations of adversarial patches. We show SAC can significantly reduce the targeted attack success rate of physical patch attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/joellliu/SegmentAndComplete.

> The existing deep learning (DL)-based automated program repair (APR) models are limited in fixing general software defects. % We present {\tool}, a DL-based approach that supports fixing for the general bugs that require dependent changes at once to one or multiple consecutive statements in one or multiple hunks of code. % We first design a novel fault localization (FL) technique for multi-hunk, multi-statement fixes that combines traditional spectrum-based (SB) FL with deep learning and data-flow analysis. It takes the buggy statements returned by the SBFL model, detects the buggy hunks to be fixed at once, and expands a buggy statement $s$ in a hunk to include other suspicious statements around $s$. We design a two-tier, tree-based LSTM model that incorporates cycle training and uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to learn proper code transformations for fixing multiple statements in the suitable fixing context consisting of surrounding subtrees. We conducted several experiments to evaluate {\tool} on three datasets: Defects4J (395 bugs), BigFix (+26k bugs), and CPatMiner (+44k bugs). On Defects4J dataset, {\tool} outperforms the baselines from 42\%--683\% in terms of the number of auto-fixed bugs with only the top-1 patches. On BigFix dataset, it fixes 31--145 more bugs than existing DL-based APR models with the top-1 patches. On CPatMiner dataset, among 667 fixed bugs, there are 169 (25.3\%) multi-hunk/multi-statement bugs. {\tool} fixes 71 and 164 more bugs, including 52 and 61 more multi-hunk/multi-statement bugs, than the state-of-the-art, DL-based APR models.

> Binary similarity analysis is critical to many code-reuse-related issues and "1-to-1" mechanism is widely applied, where one function in a binary file is matched against one function in a source file or binary file. However, we discover that function mapping is a more complex problem of "1-to-n" or even "n-to-n" due to the existence of function inlining.   In this paper, we investigate the effect of function inlining on binary similarity analysis. We first construct 4 inlining-oriented datasets for four similarity analysis tasks, including code search, OSS reuse detection, vulnerability detection, and patch presence test. Then, we further study the extent of function inlining, the performance of existing works under function inlining, and the effectiveness of existing inlining-simulation strategies. Results show that the proportion of function inlining can reach nearly 70%, while most existing works neglect it and use "1-to-1" mechanism. The mismatches cause a 30% loss in performance during code search and a 40% loss during vulnerability detection. Moreover, two existing inlining-simulation strategies can only recover 60% of the inlined functions. We discover that inlining is usually cumulative when optimization increases. Conditional inlining and incremental inlining are suggested to design low-cost and high-coverage inlining-simulation strategies.

> The deep neural network is a research hotspot for histopathological image analysis, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis for pathologists or be used for disease screening. The whole slide pathological image can reach one gigapixel and contains abundant tissue feature information, which needs to be divided into a lot of patches in the training and inference stages. This will lead to a long convergence time and large memory consumption. Furthermore, well-annotated data sets are also in short supply in the field of digital pathology. Inspired by the pathologist's clinical diagnosis process, we propose a weakly supervised deep reinforcement learning framework, which can greatly reduce the time required for network inference. We use neural network to construct the search model and decision model of reinforcement learning agent respectively. The search model predicts the next action through the image features of different magnifications in the current field of view, and the decision model is used to return the predicted probability of the current field of view image. In addition, an expert-guided model is constructed by multi-instance learning, which not only provides rewards for search model, but also guides decision model learning by the knowledge distillation method. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve fast inference and accurate prediction of whole slide images without any pixel-level annotations.

> Using only global image-class labels, weakly-supervised learning methods, such as class activation mapping, allow training CNNs to jointly classify an image, and locate regions of interest associated with the predicted class. However, without any guidance at the pixel level, such methods may yield inaccurate regions. This problem is known to be more challenging with histology images than with natural ones, since objects are less salient, structures have more variations, and foreground and background regions have stronger similarities. Therefore, computer vision methods for visual interpretation of CNNs may not directly apply. In this paper, a simple yet efficient method based on a composite loss is proposed to learn information from the fully negative samples (i.e., samples without positive regions), and thereby reduce false positives/negatives. Our new loss function contains two complementary terms: the first exploits positive evidence collected from the CNN classifier, while the second leverages the fully negative samples from training data. In particular, a pre-trained CNN is equipped with a decoder that allows refining the regions of interest. The CNN is exploited to collect both positive and negative evidence at the pixel level to train the decoder. Our method called NEGEV benefits from the fully negative samples that naturally occur in the data, without any additional supervision signals beyond image-class labels. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantial outperform related state-of-art methods on GlaS (public benchmark for colon cancer), and Camelyon16 (patch-based benchmark for breast cancer using three different backbones). Our results highlight the benefits of using both positive and negative evidence, the first obtained from a classifier, and the other naturally available in datasets.

> Video decomposition is very important to extract moving foreground objects from complex backgrounds in computer vision, machine learning, and medical imaging, e.g., extracting moving contrast-filled vessels from the complex and noisy backgrounds of X-ray coronary angiography (XCA). However, the challenges caused by dynamic backgrounds, overlapping heterogeneous environments and complex noises still exist in video decomposition. To solve these problems, this study is the first to introduce a flexible visual working memory model in video decomposition tasks to provide interpretable and high-performance hierarchical deep architecture, integrating the transformative representations between sensory and control layers from the perspective of visual and cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, robust PCA unrolling networks acting as a structure-regularized sensor layer decompose XCA into sparse/low-rank structured representations to separate moving contrast-filled vessels from noisy and complex backgrounds. Then, patch recurrent convolutional LSTM networks with a backprojection module embody unstructured random representations of the control layer in working memory, recurrently projecting spatiotemporally decomposed nonlocal patches into orthogonal subspaces for heterogeneous vessel retrieval and interference suppression. This video decomposition deep architecture effectively restores the heterogeneous profiles of intensity and the geometries of moving objects against the complex background interferences. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurate moving contrast-filled vessel extraction with excellent flexibility and computational efficiency.

> Android malware is a spreading disease in the virtual world. Anti-virus and detection systems continuously undergo patches and updates to defend against these threats. Most of the latest approaches in malware detection use Machine Learning (ML). Against the robustifying effort of detection systems, raise the \emph{evasion attacks}, where an adversary changes its targeted samples so that they are misclassified as benign. This paper considers two kinds of evasion attacks: feature-space and problem-space. \emph{Feature-space} attacks consider an adversary who manipulates ML features to evade the correct classification while minimizing or constraining the total manipulations. \textit{Problem-space} attacks refer to evasion attacks that change the actual sample. Specifically, this paper analyzes the gap between these two types in the Android malware domain. The gap between the two types of evasion attacks is examined via the retraining process of classifiers using each one of the evasion attack types. The experiments show that the gap between these two types of retrained classifiers is dramatic and may increase to 96\%. Retrained classifiers of feature-space evasion attacks have been found to be either less effective or completely ineffective against problem-space evasion attacks. Additionally, exploration of different problem-space evasion attacks shows that retraining of one problem-space evasion attack may be effective against other problem-space evasion attacks.

> With the large-scale deployment of industrial internet of things (IIoT) devices, the number of vulnerabilities that threaten IIoT security is also growing dramatically, including a mass of undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities that lack mitigation measures. Coordination Vulnerabilities Disclosure (CVD) is one of the most popular vulnerabilities sharing solutions, in which some security workers (SWs) can develop undisclosed vulnerabilities patches together. However, CVD assumes that sharing participants (SWs) are all honest, and thus offering chances for dishonest SWs to leak undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities. To combat such threats, we propose an Undisclosed IIoT Vulnerabilities Trusted Sharing Protection (UIV-TSP) scheme with dynamic token. In this article, a dynamic token is an implicit access credential for an SW to acquire an undisclosed vulnerability information, which is only held by the system and constantly updated as the SW access. Meanwhile, the latest updated token can be stealthily sneaked into the acquired information as the traceability token. Once the undisclosed vulnerability information leaves the SW host, the embedded self-destruct program will be automatically triggered to prevent leaks since the destination MAC address in the traceability token has changed. To quickly distinguish dishonest SWs, trust mechanism is adopted to evaluate the trust value of SWs. Moreover, we design a blockchain-assisted continuous logs storage method to achieve the tamper-proofing of dynamic token and the transparency of undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities sharing. The simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme is resilient to suppress dishonest SWs and protect the IoT undisclosed vulnerabilities effectively.

> Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) has been in the spotlight for the past few years, due to its remarkable abilities to solve problems which were considered to be practically unsolvable using traditional Machine Learning methods. However, even state-of-the-art Deep RL algorithms have various weaknesses that prevent them from being used extensively within industry applications, with one such major weakness being their sample-inefficiency. In an effort to patch these issues, we integrated a meta-learning technique in order to shift the objective of learning to solve a task into the objective of learning how to learn to solve a task (or a set of tasks), which we empirically show that improves overall stability and performance of Deep RL algorithms. Our model, named REIN-2, is a meta-learning scheme formulated within the RL framework, the goal of which is to develop a meta-RL agent (meta-learner) that learns how to produce other RL agents (inner-learners) that are capable of solving given environments. For this task, we convert the typical interaction of an RL agent with the environment into a new, single environment for the meta-learner to interact with. Compared to traditional state-of-the-art Deep RL algorithms, experimental results show remarkable performance of our model in popular OpenAI Gym environments in terms of scoring and sample efficiency, including the Mountain Car hard-exploration environment.

> Visual grounding localizes regions (boxes or segments) in the image corresponding to given referring expressions. In this work we address image segmentation from referring expressions, a problem that has so far only been addressed in a fully-supervised setting. A fully-supervised setup, however, requires pixel-wise supervision and is hard to scale given the expense of manual annotation. We therefore introduce a new task of weakly-supervised image segmentation from referring expressions and propose Text grounded semantic SEGgmentation (TSEG) that learns segmentation masks directly from image-level referring expressions without pixel-level annotations. Our transformer-based method computes patch-text similarities and guides the classification objective during training with a new multi-label patch assignment mechanism. The resulting visual grounding model segments image regions corresponding to given natural language expressions. Our approach TSEG demonstrates promising results for weakly-supervised referring expression segmentation on the challenging PhraseCut and RefCOCO datasets. TSEG also shows competitive performance when evaluated in a zero-shot setting for semantic segmentation on Pascal VOC.

> Randomized smoothing (RS) has been shown to be a fast, scalable technique for certifying the robustness of deep neural network classifiers. However, methods based on RS require augmenting data with large amounts of noise, which leads to significant drops in accuracy. We propose a training-free, modified smoothing approach, Smooth-Reduce, that leverages patching and aggregation to provide improved classifier certificates. Our algorithm classifies overlapping patches extracted from an input image, and aggregates the predicted logits to certify a larger radius around the input. We study two aggregation schemes -- max and mean -- and show that both approaches provide better certificates in terms of certified accuracy, average certified radii and abstention rates as compared to concurrent approaches. We also provide theoretical guarantees for such certificates, and empirically show significant improvements over other randomized smoothing methods that require expensive retraining. Further, we extend our approach to videos and provide meaningful certificates for video classifiers. A project page can be found at https://nyu-dice-lab.github.io/SmoothReduce/

> We introduce a novel technique for neural point cloud consolidation which learns from only the input point cloud. Unlike other point upsampling methods which analyze shapes via local patches, in this work, we learn from global subsets. We repeatedly self-sample the input point cloud with global subsets that are used to train a deep neural network. Specifically, we define source and target subsets according to the desired consolidation criteria (e.g., generating sharp points or points in sparse regions). The network learns a mapping from source to target subsets, and implicitly learns to consolidate the point cloud. During inference, the network is fed with random subsets of points from the input, which it displaces to synthesize a consolidated point set. We leverage the inductive bias of neural networks to eliminate noise and outliers, a notoriously difficult problem in point cloud consolidation. The shared weights of the network are optimized over the entire shape, learning non-local statistics and exploiting the recurrence of local-scale geometries. Specifically, the network encodes the distribution of the underlying shape surface within a fixed set of local kernels, which results in the best explanation of the underlying shape surface. We demonstrate the ability to consolidate point sets from a variety of shapes, while eliminating outliers and noise.

> Outsourced deep neural networks have been demonstrated to suffer from patch-based trojan attacks, in which an adversary poisons the training sets to inject a backdoor in the obtained model so that regular inputs can be still labeled correctly while those carrying a specific trigger are falsely given a target label. Due to the severity of such attacks, many backdoor detection and containment systems have recently, been proposed for deep neural networks. One major category among them are various model inspection schemes, which hope to detect backdoors before deploying models from non-trusted third-parties. In this paper, we show that such state-of-the-art schemes can be defeated by a so-called Scapegoat Backdoor Attack, which introduces a benign scapegoat trigger in data poisoning to prevent the defender from reversing the real abnormal trigger. In addition, it confines the values of network parameters within the same variances of those from clean model during training, which further significantly enhances the difficulty of the defender to learn the differences between legal and illegal models through machine-learning approaches. Our experiments on 3 popular datasets show that it can escape detection by all five state-of-the-art model inspection schemes. Moreover, this attack brings almost no side-effects on the attack effectiveness and guarantees the universal feature of the trigger compared with original patch-based trojan attacks.

> This paper shows that masked autoencoder with extrapolator (ExtraMAE) is a scalable self-supervised model for time series generation. ExtraMAE randomly masks some patches of the original time series and learns temporal dynamics by recovering the masked patches. Our approach has two core designs. First, ExtraMAE is self-supervised. Supervision allows ExtraMAE to effectively and efficiently capture the temporal dynamics of the original time series. Second, ExtraMAE proposes an extrapolator to disentangle two jobs of the decoder: recovering latent representations and mapping them back into the feature space. These unique designs enable ExtraMAE to consistently and significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SoTA) benchmarks in time series generation. The lightweight architecture also makes ExtraMAE fast and scalable. ExtraMAE shows outstanding behavior in various downstream tasks such as time series classification, prediction, and imputation. As a self-supervised generative model, ExtraMAE allows explicit management of the synthetic data. We hope this paper will usher in a new era of time series generation with self-supervised models.

> Vision transformer (ViT) and its variants have achieved remarkable successes in various visual tasks. The key characteristic of these ViT models is to adopt different aggregation strategies of spatial patch information within the artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, there is still a key lack of unified representation of different ViT architectures for systematic understanding and assessment of model representation performance. Moreover, how those well-performing ViT ANNs are similar to real biological neural networks (BNNs) is largely unexplored. To answer these fundamental questions, we, for the first time, propose a unified and biologically-plausible relational graph representation of ViT models. Specifically, the proposed relational graph representation consists of two key sub-graphs: aggregation graph and affine graph. The former one considers ViT tokens as nodes and describes their spatial interaction, while the latter one regards network channels as nodes and reflects the information communication between channels. Using this unified relational graph representation, we found that: a) a sweet spot of the aggregation graph leads to ViTs with significantly improved predictive performance; b) the graph measures of clustering coefficient and average path length are two effective indicators of model prediction performance, especially when applying on the datasets with small samples; c) our findings are consistent across various ViT architectures and multiple datasets; d) the proposed relational graph representation of ViT has high similarity with real BNNs derived from brain science data. Overall, our work provides a novel unified and biologically-plausible paradigm for more interpretable and effective representation of ViT ANNs.

> Deep neural networks were applied with success in a myriad of applications, but in safety critical use cases adversarial attacks still pose a significant threat. These attacks were demonstrated on various classification and detection tasks and are usually considered general in a sense that arbitrary network outputs can be generated by them.   In this paper we will demonstrate through simple case studies both in simulation and in real-life, that patch based attacks can be utilised to alter the output of segmentation networks. Through a few examples and the investigation of network complexity, we will also demonstrate that the number of possible output maps which can be generated via patch-based attacks of a given size is typically smaller than the area they effect or areas which should be attacked in case of practical applications.   We will prove that based on these results most patch-based attacks cannot be general in practice, namely they can not generate arbitrary output maps or if they could, they are spatially limited and this limit is significantly smaller than the receptive field of the patches.

Finally, we validate our approach with a user study evaluation and compare it against state-of-the-art, resulting in improvements.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to Trojan attacks. Existing attacks use visible patterns (e.g., a patch or image transformations) as triggers, which are vulnerable to human inspection. In this paper, we propose stealthy and efficient Trojan attacks, BppAttack. Based on existing biology literature on human visual systems, we propose to use image quantization and dithering as the Trojan trigger, making imperceptible changes. It is a stealthy and efficient attack without training auxiliary models. Due to the small changes made to images, it is hard to inject such triggers during training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a contrastive learning based approach that leverages adversarial attacks to generate negative sample pairs so that the learned trigger is precise and accurate. The proposed method achieves high attack success rates on four benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and CelebA. It also effectively bypasses existing Trojan defenses and human inspection. Our code can be found in https://github.com/RU-System-Software-and-Security/BppAttack.

> Character-based representations have important advantages over subword-based ones for morphologically rich languages. They come with increased robustness to noisy input and do not need a separate tokenization step. However, they also have a crucial disadvantage: they notably increase the length of text sequences. The GBST method from Charformer groups (aka downsamples) characters to solve this, but allows information to leak when applied to a Transformer decoder. We solve this information leak issue, thereby enabling character grouping in the decoder. We show that Charformer downsampling has no apparent benefits in NMT over previous downsampling methods in terms of translation quality, however it can be trained roughly 30% faster. Promising performance on English--Turkish translation indicate the potential of character-level models for morphologically-rich languages.

> Self-supervised pre-training for images without labels has recently achieved promising performance in image classification. The success of transformer-based methods, ViT and MAE, draws the community's attention to the design of backbone architecture and self-supervised task. In this work, we show that current masked image encoding models learn the underlying relationship between all objects in the whole scene, instead of a single object representation. Therefore, those methods bring a lot of compute time for self-supervised pre-training. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel object selection and division strategy to drop non-object patches for learning object-wise representations by selective reconstruction with interested region masks. We refer to this method ObjMAE. Extensive experiments on four commonly-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in reducing the compute cost by 72% while achieving competitive performance. Furthermore, we investigate the inter-object and intra-object relationship and find that the latter is crucial for self-supervised pre-training.

> We view the reconstruction of CAD models in the boundary representation (B-Rep) as the detection of geometric primitives of different orders, i.e. vertices, edges and surface patches, and the correspondence of primitives, which are holistically modeled as a chain complex, and show that by modeling such comprehensive structures more complete and regularized reconstructions can be achieved. We solve the complex generation problem in two steps. First, we propose a novel neural framework that consists of a sparse CNN encoder for input point cloud processing and a tri-path transformer decoder for generating geometric primitives and their mutual relationships with estimated probabilities. Second, given the probabilistic structure predicted by the neural network, we recover a definite B-Rep chain complex by solving a global optimization maximizing the likelihood under structural validness constraints and applying geometric refinements. Extensive tests on large scale CAD datasets demonstrate that the modeling of B-Rep chain complex structure enables more accurate detection for learning and more constrained reconstruction for optimization, leading to structurally more faithful and complete CAD B-Rep models than previous results.

> Gram-based and patch-based approaches are two important research lines of style transfer. Recent diversified Gram-based methods have been able to produce multiple and diverse stylized outputs for the same content and style images. However, as another widespread research interest, the diversity of patch-based methods remains challenging due to the stereotyped style swapping process based on nearest patch matching. To resolve this dilemma, in this paper, we dive into the crux of existing patch-based methods and propose a universal and efficient module, termed DivSwapper, for diversified patch-based arbitrary style transfer. The key insight is to use an essential intuition that neural patches with higher activation values could contribute more to diversity. Our DivSwapper is plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing patch-based and Gram-based methods to generate diverse results for arbitrary styles. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, it shows superiority in diversity, quality, and efficiency.

> Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are powerful hierarchical latent variable models with remarkable sample generation quality and training stability. These properties can be attributed to parameter sharing in the generative hierarchy, as well as a parameter-free diffusion-based inference procedure. In this paper, we present Few-Shot Diffusion Models (FSDM), a framework for few-shot generation leveraging conditional DDPMs. FSDMs are trained to adapt the generative process conditioned on a small set of images from a given class by aggregating image patch information using a set-based Vision Transformer (ViT). At test time, the model is able to generate samples from previously unseen classes conditioned on as few as 5 samples from that class. We empirically show that FSDM can perform few-shot generation and transfer to new datasets. We benchmark variants of our method on complex vision datasets for few-shot learning and compare to unconditional and conditional DDPM baselines. Additionally, we show how conditioning the model on patch-based input set information improves training convergence.

> To satisfy varying customer needs, device vendors and OS providers often rely on the open-source nature of the Android OS and offer customized versions of the Android OS. When a new version of the Android OS is released, device vendors and OS providers need to merge the changes from the Android OS into their customizations to account for its bug fixes, security patches, and new features. Because developers of customized OSs might have made changes to code locations that were also modified by the developers of the Android OS, the merge task can be characterized by conflicts, which can be time-consuming and error-prone to resolve.   To provide more insight into this critical aspect of the Android ecosystem, we present an empirical study that investigates how eight open-source customizations of the Android OS merge the changes from the Android OS into their projects. The study analyzes how often the developers from the customized OSs merge changes from the Android OS, how often the developers experience textual merge conflicts, and the characteristics of these conflicts. Furthermore, to analyze the effect of the conflicts, the study also analyzes how the conflicts can affect a randomly selected sample of 1,000 apps. After analyzing 1,148 merge operations, we identified that developers perform these operations for 9.7\% of the released versions of the Android OS, developers will encounter at least one conflict in 41.3\% of the merge operations, 58.1\% of the conflicts required developers to change the customized OSs, and 64.4\% of the apps considered use at least one method affected by a conflict. In addition to detailing our results, the paper also discusses the implications of our findings and provides insights for researchers and practitioners working with Android and its customizations.

> The extension of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to non-Euclidean geometries has led to multiple frameworks for studying manifolds. Many of those methods have shown design limitations resulting in poor modelling of long-range associations, as the generalisation of convolutions to irregular surfaces is non-trivial. Recent state-of-the-art performance of Vision Transformers (ViTs) demonstrates that a general-purpose architecture, which implements self-attention, could replace the local feature learning operations of CNNs. Motivated by the success of attention-modelling in computer vision, we extend ViTs to surfaces by reformulating the task of surface learning as a sequence-to-sequence problem and propose a patching mechanism for surface meshes. We validate the performance of the proposed Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) on two brain age prediction tasks in the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset and investigate the impact of pre-training on model performance. Experiments show that the SiT outperforms many surface CNNs, while indicating some evidence of general transformation invariance.

> Deep-learning models based on whole-slide digital pathology images (WSIs) become increasingly popular for predicting molecular biomarkers. Instance-based models has been the mainstream strategy for predicting genetic alterations using WSIs although bag-based models along with self-attention mechanism-based algorithms have been proposed for other digital pathology applications. In this paper, we proposed a novel Attention-based Multiple Instance Mutation Learning (AMIML) model for predicting gene mutations. AMIML was comprised of successive 1-D convolutional layers, a decoder, and a residual weight connection to facilitate further integration of a lightweight attention mechanism to detect the most predictive image patches. Using data for 24 clinically relevant genes from four cancer cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (UCEC, BRCA, GBM and KIRC), we compared AMIML with one popular instance-based model and four recently published bag-based models (e.g., CHOWDER, HE2RNA, etc.). AMIML demonstrated excellent robustness, not only outperforming all the five baseline algorithms in the vast majority of the tested genes (17 out of 24), but also providing near-best-performance for the other seven genes. Conversely, the performance of the baseline published algorithms varied across different cancers/genes. In addition, compared to the published models for genetic alterations, AMIML provided a significant improvement for predicting a wide range of genes (e.g., KMT2C, TP53, and SETD2 for KIRC; ERBB2, BRCA1, and BRCA2 for BRCA; JAK1, POLE, and MTOR for UCEC) as well as produced outstanding predictive models for other clinically relevant gene mutations, which have not been reported in the current literature. Furthermore, with the flexible and interpretable attention-based MIL pooling mechanism, AMIML could further zero-in and detect predictive image patches.

> Microarchitectural attacks have become more threatening the hardware security than before with the increasing diversity of attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown. Vendor patches cannot keep up with the pace of the new threats, which makes the dynamic anomaly detection tools more evident than before. Unfortunately, previous studies utilize hardware performance counters that lead to high performance overhead and profile limited number of microarchitectural attacks due to the small number of counters that can be profiled concurrently. This yields those detection tools inefficient in real-world scenarios.   In this study, we introduce MAD-EN dynamic detection tool that leverages system-wide energy consumption traces collected from a generic Intel RAPL tool to detect ongoing anomalies in a system. In our experiments, we show that CNN-based MAD-EN can detect 10 different microarchitectural attacks with a total of 15 variants with the highest F1 score of 0.999, which makes our tool the most generic attack detection tool so far. Moreover, individual attacks can be distinguished with a 98% accuracy after an anomaly is detected in a system. We demonstrate that MAD-EN introduces 69.3% less performance overhead compared to performance counter-based detection mechanisms.

> Recently, vision transformers were shown to be capable of outperforming convolutional neural networks when pretrained on sufficient amounts of data. In comparison to convolutional neural networks, vision transformers have a weaker inductive bias and therefore allow a more flexible feature detection. Due to their promising feature detection, this work explores vision transformers for tumor detection in digital pathology whole slide images in four tissue types, and for tissue type identification. We compared the patch-wise classification performance of the vision transformer DeiT-Tiny to the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network ResNet18. Due to the sparse availability of annotated whole slide images, we further compared both models pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled whole-slide images using state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. The results show that the vision transformer performed slightly better than the ResNet18 for three of four tissue types for tumor detection while the ResNet18 performed slightly better for the remaining tasks. The aggregated predictions of both models on slide level were correlated, indicating that the models captured similar imaging features. All together, the vision transformer models performed on par with the ResNet18 while requiring more effort to train. In order to surpass the performance of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers might require more challenging tasks to benefit from their weak inductive bias.

> A smart contract that is deployed to a blockchain system like Ethereum is, under reasonable circumstances, expected to be immutable and tamper-proof. This is both a feature (promoting integrity and transparency) and a bug (preventing security patches and feature updates). Modern smart contracts use software tricks to enable upgradeability, raising the research questions of how upgradeability is achieved and who is authorized to make changes. In this paper, we summarize and evaluate six upgradeability patterns. We develop a measurement framework for finding how many upgradeable contracts are on Ethereum that use certain prominent upgrade patters. We find 1.4 million proxy contracts which 8,225 of them are unique upgradeable proxy contracts. We also measure how they implement access control over their upgradeability: about 50% are controlled by a single Externally Owned Address (EOA), and about 14% are controlled by multi-signature wallets in which a limited number of persons can change the whole logic of the contract.

> Identifying the type of kidney stones can allow urologists to determine their formation cause, improving the early prescription of appropriate treatments to diminish future relapses. However, currently, the associated ex-vivo diagnosis (known as morpho-constitutional analysis, MCA) is time-consuming, expensive, and requires a great deal of experience, as it requires a visual analysis component that is highly operator dependant. Recently, machine learning methods have been developed for in-vivo endoscopic stone recognition. Shallow methods have been demonstrated to be reliable and interpretable but exhibit low accuracy, while deep learning-based methods yield high accuracy but are not explainable. However, high stake decisions require understandable computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to suggest a course of action based on reasonable evidence, rather than merely prescribe one. Herein, we investigate means for learning part-prototypes (PPs) that enable interpretable models. Our proposal suggests a classification for a kidney stone patch image and provides explanations in a similar way as those used on the MCA method.

> Many deep learning-based models have been introduced in finger vein recognition in recent years. These solutions, however, suffer from data dependency and are difficult to achieve model generalization. To address this problem, we are inspired by the idea of domain adaptation and propose a universal learning-based framework, which achieves generalization while training with limited data. To reduce differences between data distributions, a compressed U-Net is introduced as a domain mapper to map the raw region of interest image onto a target domain. The concentrated target domain is a unified feature space for the subsequent matching, in which a local descriptor model SOSNet is employed to embed patches into descriptors measuring the similarity of matching pairs. In the proposed framework, the domain mapper is an approximation to a specific extraction function thus the training is only a one-time effort with limited data. Moreover, the local descriptor model can be trained to be representative enough based on a public dataset of non-finger-vein images. The whole pipeline enables the framework to be well generalized, making it possible to enhance universality and helps to reduce costs of data collection, tuning and retraining. The comparable experimental results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in five public datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the framework shows application potential in other vein-based biometric recognition as well.

> Digital gigapixel whole slide image (WSI) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, and automated WSI analysis is key for computer-aided diagnosis. Currently, analyzing the integrated descriptor of probabilities or feature maps from massive local patches encoded by ResNet classifier is the main manner for WSI-level prediction. Feature representations of the sparse and tiny lesion cells in cervical slides, however, are still challenging, while the unused location representations are available to supply the semantics classification. This study designs a novel and efficient framework with a new module InCNet constructed lightweight model YOLCO (You Only Look Cytology Once). It directly extracts feature inside the single cell (cluster) instead of the traditional way that from image tile with a fixed size. The InCNet (Inline Connection Network) enriches the multi-scale connectivity without efficiency loss. The proposal allows the input size enlarged to megapixel that can stitch the WSI by the average repeats decreased from $10^3\sim10^4$ to $10^1\sim10^2$ for collecting features and predictions at two scales. Based on Transformer for classifying the integrated multi-scale multi-task WSI features, the experimental results appear $0.872$ AUC score better than the best conventional model on our dataset ($n$=2,019) from four scanners. The code is available at https://github.com/Chrisa142857/You-Only-Look-Cytopathology-Once , where the deployment version has the speed $\sim$70 s/WSI.

> We present Point-BERT, a new paradigm for learning Transformers to generalize the concept of BERT to 3D point cloud. Inspired by BERT, we devise a Masked Point Modeling (MPM) task to pre-train point cloud Transformers. Specifically, we first divide a point cloud into several local point patches, and a point cloud Tokenizer with a discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) is designed to generate discrete point tokens containing meaningful local information. Then, we randomly mask out some patches of input point clouds and feed them into the backbone Transformers. The pre-training objective is to recover the original point tokens at the masked locations under the supervision of point tokens obtained by the Tokenizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BERT-style pre-training strategy significantly improves the performance of standard point cloud Transformers. Equipped with our pre-training strategy, we show that a pure Transformer architecture attains 93.8% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 83.1% accuracy on the hardest setting of ScanObjectNN, surpassing carefully designed point cloud models with much fewer hand-made designs. We also demonstrate that the representations learned by Point-BERT transfer well to new tasks and domains, where our models largely advance the state-of-the-art of few-shot point cloud classification task. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/lulutang0608/Point-BERT

> Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires $O(k^2)$ time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) $k$. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. $O(k)$. A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTv2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTv2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running $3.2\times$ faster on a mobile device.

> Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) methods aim to recover the clean images in high resolution from low resolution observations.A family of patch-based approaches have received considerable attention and development. The minimum mean square error (MMSE) methodis a powerful image restoration method that uses a probability model on the patches of images. This paper proposes an algorithm to learn a jointgeneralized Gaussian mixture model (GGMM) from a pair of the low resolution patches and the corresponding high resolution patches fromthe reference data. We then reconstruct the high resolution image based on the MMSE method. Our numerical evaluations indicate that theMMSE-GGMM method competes with other state of the art methods.

> Convolutional neural networks are the way to solve arbitrary image segmentation tasks. However, when images are large, memory demands often exceed the available resources, in particular on a common GPU. Especially in biomedical imaging, where 3D images are common, the problems are apparent. A typical approach to solve this limitation is to break the task into smaller subtasks by dividing images into smaller image patches. Another approach, if applicable, is to look at the 2D image sections separately, and to solve the problem in 2D. Often, the loss of global context makes such approaches less effective; important global information might not be present in the current image patch, or the selected 2D image section. Here, we propose Deep Neural Patchworks (DNP), a segmentation framework that is based on hierarchical and nested stacking of patch-based networks that solves the dilemma between global context and memory limitations.

> Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant epithelial cancer arising from the nasopharynx. Survival prediction is a major concern for NPC patients, as it provides early prognostic information to plan treatments. Recently, deep survival models based on deep learning have demonstrated the potential to outperform traditional radiomics-based survival prediction models. Deep survival models usually use image patches covering the whole target regions (e.g., nasopharynx for NPC) or containing only segmented tumor regions as the input. However, the models using the whole target regions will also include non-relevant background information, while the models using segmented tumor regions will disregard potentially prognostic information existing out of primary tumors (e.g., local lymph node metastasis and adjacent tissue invasion). In this study, we propose a 3D end-to-end Deep Multi-Task Survival model (DeepMTS) for joint survival prediction and tumor segmentation in advanced NPC from pretreatment PET/CT. Our novelty is the introduction of a hard-sharing segmentation backbone to guide the extraction of local features related to the primary tumors, which reduces the interference from non-relevant background information. In addition, we also introduce a cascaded survival network to capture the prognostic information existing out of primary tumors and further leverage the global tumor information (e.g., tumor size, shape, and locations) derived from the segmentation backbone. Our experiments with two clinical datasets demonstrate that our DeepMTS can consistently outperform traditional radiomics-based survival prediction models and existing deep survival models.

> Annotating cancerous regions in whole-slide images (WSIs) of pathology samples plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, biomedical research, and machine learning algorithms development. However, generating exhaustive and accurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and costly. Drawing only coarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and it alleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of refining these approximate annotations in digital pathology to obtain more accurate ones. Some previous works have explored obtaining machine learning models from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the refinement problem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and corrected, and all of them require a -- often very large -- number of training samples. We present a method, named Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning (LC-MIL), to refine coarse annotations on a single WSI without the need of external training data. Patches cropped from a WSI with inaccurate labels are processed jointly within a multiple instance learning framework, mitigating their impact on the predictive model and refining the segmentation. Our experiments on a heterogeneous WSI set with breast cancer lymph node metastasis, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer samples show that LC-MIL significantly refines the coarse annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives, even while learning from a single slide. Moreover, we demonstrate how real annotations drawn by pathologists can be efficiently refined and improved by the proposed approach. All these results demonstrate that LC-MIL is a promising, light-weight tool to provide fine-grained annotations from coarsely annotated pathology sets.

> Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) provides important information about the tissue properties. QUS parametric image can be formed by dividing the envelope data into small overlapping patches and computing different speckle statistics such as parameters of the Nakagami and Homodyned K-distributions (HK-distribution). The calculated QUS parametric images can be erroneous since only a few independent samples are available inside the patches. Another challenge is that the envelope samples inside the patch are assumed to come from the same distribution, an assumption that is often violated given that the tissue is usually not homogenous. In this paper, we propose a method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to estimate QUS parametric images without patching. We construct a large dataset sampled from the HK-distribution, having regions with random shapes and QUS parameter values. We then use a well-known network to estimate QUS parameters in a multi-task learning fashion. Our results confirm that the proposed method is able to reduce errors and improve border definition in QUS parametric images.

> For a long time, anomaly localization has been widely used in industries. Previous studies focused on approximating the distribution of normal features without adaptation to a target dataset. However, since anomaly localization should precisely discriminate normal and abnormal features, the absence of adaptation may make the normality of abnormal features overestimated. Thus, we propose Coupled-hypersphere-based Feature Adaptation (CFA) which accomplishes sophisticated anomaly localization using features adapted to the target dataset. CFA consists of (1) a learnable patch descriptor that learns and embeds target-oriented features and (2) scalable memory bank independent of the size of the target dataset. And, CFA adopts transfer learning to increase the normal feature density so that abnormal features can be clearly distinguished by applying patch descriptor and memory bank to a pre-trained CNN. The proposed method outperforms the previous methods quantitatively and qualitatively. For example, it provides an AUROC score of 99.5% in anomaly detection and 98.5% in anomaly localization of MVTec AD benchmark. In addition, this paper points out the negative effects of biased features of pre-trained CNNs and emphasizes the importance of the adaptation to the target dataset. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sungwool/CFA_for_anomaly_localization.

> A novel explainable AI method called CLEAR Image is introduced in this paper. CLEAR Image is based on the view that a satisfactory explanation should be contrastive, counterfactual and measurable. CLEAR Image explains an image's classification probability by contrasting the image with a corresponding image generated automatically via adversarial learning. This enables both salient segmentation and perturbations that faithfully determine each segment's importance. CLEAR Image was successfully applied to a medical imaging case study where it outperformed methods such as Grad-CAM and LIME by an average of 27% using a novel pointing game metric. CLEAR Image excels in identifying cases of "causal overdetermination" where there are multiple patches in an image, any one of which is sufficient by itself to cause the classification probability to be close to one.

> Pressure Field Contact (PFC) was recently introduced as a method for detailed modeling of contact interface regions at rates much faster than elasticity-theory models, while at the same time predicting essential trends and capturing rich contact behavior. The PFC model was designed to work in conjunction with error-controlled integration at the acceleration level. Therefore a vast majority of existent multibody codes using solvers at the velocity level cannot incorporate PFC in its original form. In this work we introduce a discrete in time approximation of PFC making it suitable for use with existent velocity-level time steppers and enabling execution at real-time rates. We evaluate the accuracy and performance gains of our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulating relevant manipulation tasks. The method is available in open source as part of Drake's Hydroelastic Contact model.

> We examine how the saccade mechanism from biological vision can be used to make deep neural networks more efficient for classification and object detection problems. Our proposed approach is based on the ideas of attention-driven visual processing and saccades, miniature eye movements influenced by attention. We conduct experiments by analyzing: i) the robustness of different deep neural network (DNN) feature extractors to partially-sensed images for image classification and object detection, and ii) the utility of saccades in masking image patches for image classification and object tracking. Experiments with convolutional nets (ResNet-18) and transformer-based models (ViT, DETR, TransTrack) are conducted on several datasets (CIFAR-10, DAVSOD, MSCOCO, and MOT17). Our experiments show intelligent data reduction via learning to mimic human saccades when used in conjunction with state-of-the-art DNNs for classification, detection, and tracking tasks. We observed minimal drop in performance for the classification and detection tasks while only using about 30\% of the original sensor data. We discuss how the saccade mechanism can inform hardware design via ``in-pixel'' processing.

> Self-supervised contrastive learning is a powerful tool to learn visual representation without labels. Prior work has primarily focused on evaluating the recognition accuracy of various pre-training algorithms, but has overlooked other behavioral aspects. In addition to accuracy, distributional robustness plays a critical role in the reliability of machine learning models. We design and conduct a series of robustness tests to quantify the behavioral differences between contrastive learning and supervised learning to downstream or pre-training data distribution changes. These tests leverage data corruptions at multiple levels, ranging from pixel-level gamma distortion to patch-level shuffling and to dataset-level distribution shift. Our tests unveil intriguing robustness behaviors of contrastive and supervised learning. On the one hand, under downstream corruptions, we generally observe that contrastive learning is surprisingly more robust than supervised learning. On the other hand, under pre-training corruptions, we find contrastive learning vulnerable to patch shuffling and pixel intensity change, yet less sensitive to dataset-level distribution change. We attempt to explain these results through the role of data augmentation and feature space properties. Our insight has implications in improving the downstream robustness of supervised learning.

By combining the spatial transformer with a representation learning approach we learn to split images into separately encoded patches to associate visual and textual representations in an interpretable manner. On variations of MNIST and CIFAR10, our model is able to perform weakly supervised object detection and demonstrates its ability to extrapolate to unseen combination of objects.

> This paper studies the traffic state estimation (TSE) problem using sparse observations from mobile sensors. Most existing TSE methods either rely on well-defined physical traffic flow models or require large amounts of simulation data as input to train machine learning models. Different from previous studies, we propose a purely data-driven and model-free solution in this paper. We consider the TSE as a spatiotemporal matrix completion/interpolation problem, and apply spatiotemporal delay embedding to transform the original incomplete matrix into a fourth-order Hankel structured tensor. By imposing a low-rank assumption on this tensor structure, we can approximate and characterize both global and local spatiotemporal patterns in a data-driven manner. We use the truncated nuclear norm of a balanced spatiotemporal unfolding -- in which each column represents the vectorization of a small patch in the original matrix -- to approximate the tensor rank. An efficient solution algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is developed for model learning. The proposed framework only involves two hyperparameters, spatial and temporal window lengths, which are easy to set given the degree of data sparsity. We conduct numerical experiments on real-world high-resolution trajectory data, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model in some challenging scenarios.

> Dynamical models underpin our ability to understand and predict the behavior of natural systems. Whether dynamical models are developed from first-principles derivations or from observational data, they are predicated on our choice of state variables. The choice of state variables is driven by convenience and intuition, and in the data-driven case the observed variables are often chosen to be the state variables. The dimensionality of these variables (and consequently the dynamical models) can be arbitrarily large, obscuring the underlying behavior of the system. In truth, these variables are often highly redundant and the system is driven by a much smaller set of latent intrinsic variables. In this study, we combine the mathematical theory of manifolds with the representational capacity of neural networks to develop a method that learns a system's intrinsic state variables directly from time series data, and also learns predictive models for their dynamics. What distinguishes our method is its ability to reduce data to the intrinsic dimensionality of the nonlinear manifold they live on. This ability is enabled by the concepts of charts and atlases from the theory of manifolds, whereby a manifold is represented by a collection of patches that are sewn together -- a necessary representation to attain intrinsic dimensionality. We demonstrate this approach on several high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting framework provides the ability to develop dynamical models of the lowest possible dimension, capturing the essence of a system.

> Transformer architectures are now central to sequence modeling tasks. At its heart is the attention mechanism, which enables effective modeling of long-term dependencies in a sequence. Recently, transformers have been successfully applied in the computer vision domain, where 2D images are first segmented into patches and then treated as 1D sequences. Such linearization, however, impairs the notion of spatial locality in images, which bears important visual clues. To bridge the gap, we propose ripple attention, a sub-quadratic attention mechanism for vision transformers. Built upon the recent kernel-based efficient attention mechanisms, we design a novel dynamic programming algorithm that weights contributions of different tokens to a query with respect to their relative spatial distances in the 2D space in linear observed time. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ripple attention on various visual tasks.

> Adversarial attacks in deep learning models, especially for safety-critical systems, are gaining more and more attention in recent years, due to the lack of trust in the security and robustness of AI models. Yet the more primitive adversarial attacks might be physically infeasible or require some resources that are hard to access like the training data, which motivated the emergence of patch attacks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview to cover existing techniques of adversarial patch attacks, aiming to help interested researchers quickly catch up with the progress in this field. We also discuss existing techniques for developing detection and defences against adversarial patches, aiming to help the community better understand this field and its applications in the real world.

> Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently demonstrated exemplary performance on a variety of vision tasks and are being used as an alternative to CNNs. Their design is based on a self-attention mechanism that processes images as a sequence of patches, which is quite different compared to CNNs. Hence it is interesting to study if ViTs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks happen when an attacker poisons a small part of the training data for malicious purposes. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that ViTs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. We also find an intriguing difference between ViTs and CNNs - interpretation algorithms effectively highlight the trigger on test images for ViTs but not for CNNs. Based on this observation, we propose a test-time image blocking defense for ViTs which reduces the attack success rate by a large margin.

> Pervasive backdoors are triggered by dynamic and pervasive input perturbations. They can be intentionally injected by attackers or naturally exist in normally trained models. They have a different nature from the traditional static and localized backdoors that can be triggered by perturbing a small input area with some fixed pattern, e.g., a patch with solid color. Existing defense techniques are highly effective for traditional backdoors. However, they may not work well for pervasive backdoors, especially regarding backdoor removal and model hardening. In this paper, we propose a novel model hardening technique against pervasive backdoors, including both natural and injected backdoors. We develop a general pervasive attack based on an encoder-decoder architecture enhanced with a special transformation layer. The attack can model a wide range of existing pervasive backdoor attacks and quantify them by class distances. As such, using the samples derived from our attack in adversarial training can harden a model against these backdoor vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on 9 datasets with 15 model structures shows that our technique can enlarge class distances by 59.65% on average with less than 1% accuracy degradation and no robustness loss, outperforming five hardening techniques such as adversarial training, universal adversarial training, MOTH, etc. It can reduce the attack success rate of six pervasive backdoor attacks from 99.06% to 1.94%, surpassing seven state-of-the-art backdoor removal techniques.

> In this work, we present Patch-based Object-centric Video Transformer (POVT), a novel region-based video generation architecture that leverages object-centric information to efficiently model temporal dynamics in videos. We build upon prior work in video prediction via an autoregressive transformer over the discrete latent space of compressed videos, with an added modification to model object-centric information via bounding boxes. Due to better compressibility of object-centric representations, we can improve training efficiency by allowing the model to only access object information for longer horizon temporal information. When evaluated on various difficult object-centric datasets, our method achieves better or equal performance to other video generation models, while remaining computationally more efficient and scalable. In addition, we show that our method is able to perform object-centric controllability through bounding box manipulation, which may aid downstream tasks such as video editing, or visual planning.

- `2206.10096v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10096v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10096v1)

> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in various medical imaging tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operation, CNNs generally cannot model long-range dependencies well, which are important for accurately identifying or mapping corresponding breast lesion features computed from unregistered multiple mammograms. This motivates us to leverage the architecture of Multi-view Vision Transformers to capture long-range relationships of multiple mammograms from the same patient in one examination. For this purpose, we employ local Transformer blocks to separately learn patch relationships within four mammograms acquired from two-view (CC/MLO) of two-side (right/left) breasts. The outputs from different views and sides are concatenated and fed into global Transformer blocks, to jointly learn patch relationships between four images representing two different views of the left and right breasts. To evaluate the proposed model, we retrospectively assembled a dataset involving 949 sets of mammograms, which include 470 malignant cases and 479 normal or benign cases. We trained and evaluated the model using a five-fold cross-validation method. Without any arduous preprocessing steps (e.g., optimal window cropping, chest wall or pectoral muscle removal, two-view image registration, etc.), our four-image (two-view-two-side) Transformer-based model achieves case classification performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC = 0.818), which significantly outperforms AUC = 0.784 achieved by the state-of-the-art multi-view CNNs (p = 0.009). It also outperforms two one-view-two-side models that achieve AUC of 0.724 (CC view) and 0.769 (MLO view), respectively. The study demonstrates the potential of using Transformers to develop high-performing computer-aided diagnosis schemes that combine four mammograms.

> Recent advances in the industrial inspection of textured surfaces-in the form of visual inspection-have made such inspections possible for efficient, flexible manufacturing systems. We propose an unsupervised feature memory rearrangement network (FMR-Net) to accurately detect various textural defects simultaneously. Consistent with mainstream methods, we adopt the idea of background reconstruction; however, we innovatively utilize artificial synthetic defects to enable the model to recognize anomalies, while traditional wisdom relies only on defect-free samples. First, we employ an encoding module to obtain multiscale features of the textured surface. Subsequently, a contrastive-learning-based memory feature module (CMFM) is proposed to obtain discriminative representations and construct a normal feature memory bank in the latent space, which can be employed as a substitute for defects and fast anomaly scores at the patch level. Next, a novel global feature rearrangement module (GFRM) is proposed to further suppress the reconstruction of residual defects. Finally, a decoding module utilizes the restored features to reconstruct the normal texture background. In addition, to improve inspection performance, a two-phase training strategy is utilized for accurate defect restoration refinement, and we exploit a multimodal inspection method to achieve noise-robust defect localization. We verify our method through extensive experiments and test its practical deployment in collaborative edge--cloud intelligent manufacturing scenarios by means of a multilevel detection method, demonstrating that FMR-Net exhibits state-of-the-art inspection accuracy and shows great potential for use in edge-computing-enabled smart industries.

> We present a convex formulation of compliant frictional contact and a robust, performant method to solve it in practice. By analytically eliminating contact constraints, we obtain an unconstrained convex problem. Our solver has proven global convergence and warm-starts effectively, enabling simulation at interactive rates. We develop compact analytical expressions of contact forces allowing us to describe our model in clear physical terms and to rigorously characterize our approximations. Moreover, this enables us not only to model point contact, but also to incorporate sophisticated models of compliant contact patches. Our time stepping scheme includes the midpoint rule, which we demonstrate achieves second order accuracy even with frictional contact. We introduce a number of accuracy metrics and show our method outperforms existing commercial and open source alternatives without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate robust simulation of robotic manipulation tasks at interactive rates, with accurately resolved stiction and contact transitions, as required for meaningful sim-to-real transfer. Our method is implemented in the open source robotics toolkit Drake.

> Visual question answering (VQA) in surgery is largely unexplored. Expert surgeons are scarce and are often overloaded with clinical and academic workloads. This overload often limits their time answering questionnaires from patients, medical students or junior residents related to surgical procedures. At times, students and junior residents also refrain from asking too many questions during classes to reduce disruption. While computer-aided simulators and recording of past surgical procedures have been made available for them to observe and improve their skills, they still hugely rely on medical experts to answer their questions. Having a Surgical-VQA system as a reliable 'second opinion' could act as a backup and ease the load on the medical experts in answering these questions. The lack of annotated medical data and the presence of domain-specific terms has limited the exploration of VQA for surgical procedures. In this work, we design a Surgical-VQA task that answers questionnaires on surgical procedures based on the surgical scene. Extending the MICCAI endoscopic vision challenge 2018 dataset and workflow recognition dataset further, we introduce two Surgical-VQA datasets with classification and sentence-based answers. To perform Surgical-VQA, we employ vision-text transformers models. We further introduce a residual MLP-based VisualBert encoder model that enforces interaction between visual and text tokens, improving performance in classification-based answering. Furthermore, we study the influence of the number of input image patches and temporal visual features on the model performance in both classification and sentence-based answering.

> Establishing voxelwise semantic correspondence across distinct imaging modalities is a foundational yet formidable computer vision task. Current multi-modality registration techniques maximize hand-crafted inter-domain similarity functions, are limited in modeling nonlinear intensity-relationships and deformations, and may require significant re-engineering or underperform on new tasks, datasets, and domain pairs. This work presents ContraReg, an unsupervised contrastive representation learning approach to multi-modality deformable registration. By projecting learned multi-scale local patch features onto a jointly learned inter-domain embedding space, ContraReg obtains representations useful for non-rigid multi-modality alignment. Experimentally, ContraReg achieves accurate and robust results with smooth and invertible deformations across a series of baselines and ablations on a neonatal T1-T2 brain MRI registration task with all methods validated over a wide range of deformation regularization strengths.

> Improving software performance is an important yet challenging part of the software development cycle. Today, the majority of performance inefficiencies are identified and patched by performance experts. Recent advancements in deep learning approaches and the wide-spread availability of open source data creates a great opportunity to automate the identification and patching of performance problems. In this paper, we present DeepPERF, a transformer-based approach to suggest performance improvements for C# applications. We pretrain DeepPERF on English and Source code corpora and followed by finetuning for the task of generating performance improvement patches for C# applications. Our evaluation shows that our model can generate the same performance improvement suggestion as the developer fix in ~53% of the cases, getting ~34% of them verbatim in our expert-verified dataset of performance changes made by C# developers. Additionally, we evaluate DeepPERF on 50 open source C# repositories on GitHub using both benchmark and unit tests and find that our model is able to suggest valid performance improvements that can improve both CPU usage and Memory allocations. So far we've submitted 19 pull-requests with 28 different performance optimizations and 11 of these PRs have been approved by the project owners.

> In medical image processing, the most important information is often located on small parts of the image. Patch-based approaches aim at using only the most relevant parts of the image. Finding ways to automatically select the patches is a challenge. In this paper, we investigate two criteria to choose patches: entropy and a spectral similarity criterion. We perform experiments at different levels of patch size. We train a Convolutional Neural Network on the subsets of patches and analyze the training time. We find that, in addition to requiring less preprocessing time, the classifiers trained on the datasets of patches selected based on entropy converge faster than on those selected based on the spectral similarity criterion and, furthermore, lead to higher accuracy. Moreover, patches of high entropy lead to faster convergence and better accuracy than patches of low entropy.

> According to some medical imaging techniques, breast histopathology images called Hematoxylin and Eosin are considered as the gold standard for cancer diagnoses. Based on the idea of dividing the pathologic image (WSI) into multiple patches, we used the window [512,512] sliding from left to right and sliding from top to bottom, each sliding step overlapping by 50% to augmented data on a dataset of 400 images which were gathered from the ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge. Then use the EffficientNet model to classify and identify the histopathological images of breast cancer into 4 types: Normal, Benign, Carcinoma, Invasive Carcinoma. The EffficientNet model is a recently developed model that uniformly scales the width, depth, and resolution of the network with a set of fixed scaling factors that are well suited for training images with high resolution. And the results of this model give a rather competitive classification efficiency, achieving 98% accuracy on the training set and 93% on the evaluation set.

> Fixing bugs is easiest by patching source code. However, source code is not always available: only 0.3% of the ~49M smart contracts that are currently deployed on Ethereum have their source code publicly available. Moreover, since contracts may call functions from other contracts, security flaws in closed-source contracts may affect open-source contracts as well. However, current state-of-the-art approaches that operate on closed-source contracts (i.e., EVM bytecode), such as EVMPatch and SmartShield, make use of purely hard-coded templates that leverage fix patching patterns. As a result, they cannot dynamically adapt to the bytecode that is being patched, which severely limits their flexibility and scalability. For instance, when patching integer overflows using hard-coded templates, a particular patch template needs to be employed as the bounds to be checked are different for each integer size. In this paper, we propose Elysium, a scalable approach towards automatic smart contract repair at the bytecode level. Elysium combines template-based and semantic-based patching by inferring context information from bytecode. Elysium is currently able to patch 7 different types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts automatically and can easily be extended with new templates and new bug-finding tools. We evaluate its effectiveness and correctness using 3 different datasets by replaying more than 500K transactions on patched contracts. We find that Elysium outperforms existing tools by patching at least 30% more contracts correctly. Finally, we also compare the overhead of Elysium in terms of deployment and transaction cost. In comparison to other tools, we find that generally Elysium minimizes the runtime cost (i.e., transaction cost) up to a factor of 1.7, for only a marginally higher deployment cost, where deployment cost is a one-time cost as compared to the runtime cost.

> The mass distribution of dark matter haloes is the result of the hierarchical growth of initial density perturbations through mass accretion and mergers. We use an interpretable machine-learning framework to provide physical insights into the origin of the spherically-averaged mass profile of dark matter haloes. We train a gradient-boosted-trees algorithm to predict the final mass profiles of cluster-sized haloes, and measure the importance of the different inputs provided to the algorithm. We find two primary scales in the initial conditions (ICs) that impact the final mass profile: the density at approximately the scale of the haloes' Lagrangian patch $R_L$ ($R\sim 0.7\, R_L$) and that in the large-scale environment ($R\sim 1.7~R_L$). The model also identifies three primary time-scales in the halo assembly history that affect the final profile: (i) the formation time of the virialized, collapsed material inside the halo, (ii) the dynamical time, which captures the dynamically unrelaxed, infalling component of the halo over its first orbit, (iii) a third, most recent time-scale, which captures the impact on the outer profile of recent massive merger events. While the inner profile retains memory of the ICs, this information alone is insufficient to yield accurate predictions for the outer profile. As we add information about the haloes' mass accretion history, we find a significant improvement in the predicted profiles at all radii. Our machine-learning framework provides novel insights into the role of the ICs and the mass assembly history in determining the final mass profile of cluster-sized haloes.

> While motion planning of locomotion for legged robots has shown great success, motion planning for legged robots with dexterous multi-finger grasping is not mature yet. We present an efficient motion planning framework for simultaneously solving locomotion (e.g., centroidal dynamics), grasping (e.g., patch contact), and contact (e.g., gait) problems. To accelerate the planning process, we propose distributed optimization frameworks based on Alternating Direction Methods of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the original large-scale Mixed-Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP). The resulting frameworks use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) to solve contact and NonLinear Programming (NLP) to solve nonlinear dynamics, which are more computationally tractable and less sensitive to parameters. Also, we explicitly enforce patch contact constraints from limit surfaces with micro-spine grippers. We demonstrate our proposed framework in the hardware experiments, showing that the multi-limbed robot is able to realize various motions including free-climbing at a slope angle 45{\deg} with a much shorter planning time.

> We propose ADIOS, a masked image model (MIM) framework for self-supervised learning, which simultaneously learns a masking function and an image encoder using an adversarial objective. The image encoder is trained to minimise the distance between representations of the original and that of a masked image. The masking function, conversely, aims at maximising this distance. ADIOS consistently improves on state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) methods on a variety of tasks and datasets -- including classification on ImageNet100 and STL10, transfer learning on CIFAR10/100, Flowers102 and iNaturalist, as well as robustness evaluated on the backgrounds challenge (Xiao et al., 2021) -- while generating semantically meaningful masks. Unlike modern MIM models such as MAE, BEiT and iBOT, ADIOS does not rely on the image-patch tokenisation construction of Vision Transformers, and can be implemented with convolutional backbones. We further demonstrate that the masks learned by ADIOS are more effective in improving representation learning of SSL methods than masking schemes used in popular MIM models. Code is available at https://github.com/YugeTen/adios.

Patches with high entropy are being processed by the encoder with the largest number of parameters, patches with moderate entropy are processed by the encoder with a moderate number of parameters, and patches with low entropy are processed by the smallest encoder. The intuition behind the module is the following: as patches with high entropy contain more information, they need an encoder with more parameters, unlike low entropy patches, which can be processed using a small encoder. Consequently, processing part of the patches via the smaller encoder can significantly reduce the computational cost of the module. Experiments show that EPE can boost the performance of existing real-time semantic segmentation models with a slight increase in the computational cost. Specifically, EPE increases the mIOU performance of DFANet A by 0.9% with only 1.2% increase in the number of parameters and the mIOU performance of EDANet by 1% with 10% increase of the model parameters.

> With the broad application of deep neural networks (DNNs), backdoor attacks have gradually attracted attention. Backdoor attacks are insidious, and poisoned models perform well on benign samples and are only triggered when given specific inputs, which cause the neural network to produce incorrect outputs. The state-of-the-art backdoor attack work is implemented by data poisoning, i.e., the attacker injects poisoned samples into the dataset, and the models trained with that dataset are infected with the backdoor. However, most of the triggers used in the current study are fixed patterns patched on a small fraction of an image and are often clearly mislabeled, which is easily detected by humans or defense methods such as Neural Cleanse and SentiNet. Also, it's difficult to be learned by DNNs without mislabeling, as they may ignore small patterns. In this paper, we propose a generalized backdoor attack method based on the frequency domain, which can implement backdoor implantation without mislabeling and accessing the training process. It is invisible to human beings and able to evade the commonly used defense methods. We evaluate our approach in the no-label and clean-label cases on three datasets (CIFAR-10, STL-10, and GTSRB) with two popular scenarios (self-supervised learning and supervised learning). The results show our approach can achieve a high attack success rate (above 90%) on all the tasks without significant performance degradation on main tasks. Also, we evaluate the bypass performance of our approach for different kinds of defenses, including the detection of training data (i.e., Activation Clustering), the preprocessing of inputs (i.e., Filtering), the detection of inputs (i.e., SentiNet), and the detection of models (i.e., Neural Cleanse). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach shows excellent robustness to such defenses.

> Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that iteratively denoise samples to produce data. While many works have focused on the number of iterations in this sampling procedure, few have focused on the cost of each iteration. We find that adding a simple ViT-style patching transformation can considerably reduce a diffusion model's sampling time and memory usage. We justify our approach both through an analysis of the diffusion model objective, and through empirical experiments on LSUN Church, ImageNet 256, and FFHQ 1024. We provide implementations in Tensorflow and Pytorch.

> Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown its advantages over the convolutional neural network (CNN) with its ability to capture global long-range dependencies for visual representation learning. Besides ViT, contrastive learning is another popular research topic recently. While previous contrastive learning works are mostly based on CNNs, some recent studies have attempted to combine ViT and contrastive learning for enhanced self-supervised learning. Despite the considerable progress, these combinations of ViT and contrastive learning mostly focus on the instance-level contrastiveness, which often overlook the global contrastiveness and also lack the ability to directly learn the clustering result (e.g., for images). In view of this, this paper presents a novel deep clustering approach termed Vision Transformer for Contrastive Clustering (VTCC), which for the first time, to our knowledge, unifies the Transformer and the contrastive learning for the image clustering task. Specifically, with two random augmentations performed on each image, we utilize a ViT encoder with two weight-sharing views as the backbone. To remedy the potential instability of the ViT, we incorporate a convolutional stem to split each augmented sample into a sequence of patches, which uses multiple stacked small convolutions instead of a big convolution in the patch projection layer. By learning the feature representations for the sequences of patches via the backbone, an instance projector and a cluster projector are further utilized to perform the instance-level contrastive learning and the global clustering structure learning, respectively. Experiments on eight image datasets demonstrate the stability (during the training-from-scratch) and the superiority (in clustering performance) of our VTCC approach over the state-of-the-art.

> Semantic image segmentation is an important prerequisite for context-awareness and autonomous robotics in surgery. The state of the art has focused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive surgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data and obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open surgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs. full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance increases, consistently across modalities, with the spatial context of the input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to whole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04), which is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional functional tissue information.

> Multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a powerful backbone for computer vision tasks, while the self-attention computation in Transformer scales quadratically w.r.t. the input patch number. Thus, existing solutions commonly employ down-sampling operations (e.g., average pooling) over keys/values to dramatically reduce the computational cost. In this work, we argue that such over-aggressive down-sampling design is not invertible and inevitably causes information dropping especially for high-frequency components in objects (e.g., texture details). Motivated by the wavelet theory, we construct a new Wavelet Vision Transformer (\textbf{Wave-ViT}) that formulates the invertible down-sampling with wavelet transforms and self-attention learning in a unified way. This proposal enables self-attention learning with lossless down-sampling over keys/values, facilitating the pursuing of a better efficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Furthermore, inverse wavelet transforms are leveraged to strengthen self-attention outputs by aggregating local contexts with enlarged receptive field. We validate the superiority of Wave-ViT through extensive experiments over multiple vision tasks (e.g., image recognition, object detection and instance segmentation). Its performances surpass state-of-the-art ViT backbones with comparable FLOPs. Source code is available at \url{https://github.com/YehLi/ImageNetModel}.

> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in particular ulcerative colitis (UC), is graded by endoscopists and this assessment is the basis for risk stratification and therapy monitoring. Presently, endoscopic characterisation is largely operator dependant leading to sometimes undesirable clinical outcomes for patients with IBD. We focus on the Mayo Endoscopic Scoring (MES) system which is widely used but requires the reliable identification of subtle changes in mucosal inflammation. Most existing deep learning classification methods cannot detect these fine-grained changes which make UC grading such a challenging task. In this work, we introduce a novel patch-level instance-group discrimination with pretext-invariant representation learning (PLD-PIRL) for self-supervised learning (SSL). Our experiments demonstrate both improved accuracy and robustness compared to the baseline supervised network and several state-of-the-art SSL methods. Compared to the baseline (ResNet50) supervised classification our proposed PLD-PIRL obtained an improvement of 4.75% on hold-out test data and 6.64% on unseen center test data for top-1 accuracy.

> Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated outstanding Compressed Sensing (CS) performance compared to traditional, hand-crafted methods. However, they are broadly limited in terms of generalisability, inductive bias and difficulty to model long distance relationships. Transformer neural networks (TNN) overcome such issues by implementing an attention mechanism designed to capture dependencies between inputs. However, high-resolution tasks typically require vision Transformers (ViT) to decompose an image into patch-based tokens, limiting inputs to inherently local contexts. We propose a novel image decomposition that naturally embeds images into low-resolution inputs. These Kaleidoscope tokens (KD) provide a mechanism for global attention, at the same computational cost as a patch-based approach. To showcase this development, we replace CNN components in a well-known CS-MRI neural network with TNN blocks and demonstrate the improvements afforded by KD. We also propose an ensemble of image tokens, which enhance overall image quality and reduces model size. Supplementary material is available: https://github.com/uqmarlonbran/TCS.git

> Unpaired image-to-image translation aims to find a mapping between the source domain and the target domain. To alleviate the problem of the lack of supervised labels for the source images, cycle-consistency based methods have been proposed for image structure preservation by assuming a reversible relationship between unpaired images. However, this assumption only uses limited correspondence between image pairs. Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has been used to further investigate the image correspondence in unpaired image translation by using patch-based positive/negative learning. Patch-based contrastive routines obtain the positives by self-similarity computation and recognize the rest patches as negatives. This flexible learning paradigm obtains auxiliary contextualized information at a low cost. As the negatives own an impressive sample number, with curiosity, we make an investigation based on a question: are all negatives necessary for feature contrastive learning? Unlike previous CL approaches that use negatives as much as possible, in this paper, we study the negatives from an information-theoretic perspective and introduce a new negative Pruning technology for Unpaired image-to-image Translation (PUT) by sparsifying and ranking the patches. The proposed algorithm is efficient, flexible and enables the model to learn essential information between corresponding patches stably. By putting quality over quantity, only a few negative patches are required to achieve better results. Lastly, we validate the superiority, stability, and versatility of our model through comparative experiments.

> Image-based virtual try-on strives to transfer the appearance of a clothing item onto the image of a target person. Prior work focuses mainly on upper-body clothes (e.g. t-shirts, shirts, and tops) and neglects full-body or lower-body items. This shortcoming arises from a main factor: current publicly available datasets for image-based virtual try-on do not account for this variety, thus limiting progress in the field. To address this deficiency, we introduce Dress Code, which contains images of multi-category clothes. Dress Code is more than 3x larger than publicly available datasets for image-based virtual try-on and features high-resolution paired images (1024x768) with front-view, full-body reference models. To generate HD try-on images with high visual quality and rich in details, we propose to learn fine-grained discriminating features. Specifically, we leverage a semantic-aware discriminator that makes predictions at pixel-level instead of image- or patch-level. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach surpasses the baselines and state-of-the-art competitors in terms of visual quality and quantitative results. The Dress Code dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/dress-code.

> While the abuse of deepfake technology has caused serious concerns recently, how to detect deepfake videos is still a challenge due to the high photo-realistic synthesis of each frame. Existing image-level approaches often focus on single frame and ignore the spatiotemporal cues hidden in deepfake videos, resulting in poor generalization and robustness. The key of a video-level detector is to fully exploit the spatiotemporal inconsistency distributed in local facial regions across different frames in deepfake videos. Inspired by that, this paper proposes a simple yet effective patch-level approach to facilitate deepfake video detection via spatiotemporal dropout transformer. The approach reorganizes each input video into bag of patches that is then fed into a vision transformer to achieve robust representation. Specifically, a spatiotemporal dropout operation is proposed to fully explore patch-level spatiotemporal cues and serve as effective data augmentation to further enhance model's robustness and generalization ability. The operation is flexible and can be easily plugged into existing vision transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against 25 state-of-the-arts with impressive robustness, generalizability, and representation ability.

> We propose bootstrapped masked autoencoders (BootMAE), a new approach for vision BERT pretraining. BootMAE improves the original masked autoencoders (MAE) with two core designs: 1) momentum encoder that provides online feature as extra BERT prediction targets; 2) target-aware decoder that tries to reduce the pressure on the encoder to memorize target-specific information in BERT pretraining. The first design is motivated by the observation that using a pretrained MAE to extract the features as the BERT prediction target for masked tokens can achieve better pretraining performance. Therefore, we add a momentum encoder in parallel with the original MAE encoder, which bootstraps the pretraining performance by using its own representation as the BERT prediction target. In the second design, we introduce target-specific information (e.g., pixel values of unmasked patches) from the encoder directly to the decoder to reduce the pressure on the encoder of memorizing the target-specific information. Thus, the encoder focuses on semantic modeling, which is the goal of BERT pretraining, and does not need to waste its capacity in memorizing the information of unmasked tokens related to the prediction target. Through extensive experiments, our BootMAE achieves $84.2\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B backbone, outperforming MAE by $+0.8\%$ under the same pre-training epochs. BootMAE also gets $+1.0$ mIoU improvements on semantic segmentation on ADE20K and $+1.3$ box AP, $+1.4$ mask AP improvement on object detection and segmentation on COCO dataset. Code is released at https://github.com/LightDXY/BootMAE.

> Training a deep learning model on source code has gained significant traction recently. Since such models reason about vectors of numbers, source code needs to be converted to a code representation before vectorization. Numerous approaches have been proposed to represent source code, from sequences of tokens to abstract syntax trees. However, there is no systematic study to understand the effect of code representation on learning performance. Through a controlled experiment, we examine the impact of various code representations on model accuracy and usefulness in deep learning-based program repair. We train 21 different generative models that suggest fixes for name-based bugs, including 14 different homogeneous code representations, four mixed representations for the buggy and fixed code, and three different embeddings. We assess if fix suggestions produced by the model in various code representations are automatically patchable, meaning they can be transformed to a valid code that is ready to be applied to the buggy code to fix it. We also conduct a developer study to qualitatively evaluate the usefulness of inferred fixes in different code representations. Our results highlight the importance of code representation and its impact on learning and usefulness. Our findings indicate that (1) while code abstractions help the learning process, they can adversely impact the usefulness of inferred fixes from a developer's point of view; this emphasizes the need to look at the patches generated from the practitioner's perspective, which is often neglected in the literature, (2) mixed representations can outperform homogeneous code representations, (3) bug type can affect the effectiveness of different code representations; although current techniques use a single code representation for all bug types, there is no single best code representation applicable to all bug types.

> Standard approaches for adversarial patch generation lead to noisy conspicuous patterns, which are easily recognizable by humans. Recent research has proposed several approaches to generate naturalistic patches using generative adversarial networks (GANs), yet only a few of them were evaluated on the object detection use case. Moreover, the state of the art mostly focuses on suppressing a single large bounding box in input by overlapping it with the patch directly. Suppressing objects near the patch is a different, more complex task. In this work, we have evaluated the existing approaches to generate inconspicuous patches. We have adapted methods, originally developed for different computer vision tasks, to the object detection use case with YOLOv3 and the COCO dataset. We have evaluated two approaches to generate naturalistic patches: by incorporating patch generation into the GAN training process and by using the pretrained GAN. For both cases, we have assessed a trade-off between performance and naturalistic patch appearance. Our experiments have shown, that using a pre-trained GAN helps to gain realistic-looking patches while preserving the performance similar to conventional adversarial patches.

> Learning new representations of 3D point clouds is an active research area in 3D vision, as the order-invariant point cloud structure still presents challenges to the design of neural network architectures. Recent works explored learning either global or local features or both for point clouds, however none of the earlier methods focused on capturing contextual shape information by analysing local orientation distribution of points. In this paper, we leverage on point orientation distributions around a point in order to obtain an expressive local neighborhood representation for point clouds. We achieve this by dividing the spherical neighborhood of a given point into predefined cone volumes, and statistics inside each volume are used as point features. In this way, a local patch can be represented by not only the selected point's nearest neighbors, but also considering a point density distribution defined along multiple orientations around the point. We are then able to construct an orientation distribution function (ODF) neural network that involves an ODFBlock which relies on mlp (multi-layer perceptron) layers. The new ODFNet model achieves state-of the-art accuracy for object classification on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets, and segmentation on ShapeNet S3DIS datasets.

> We introduce FewGAN, a generative model for generating novel, high-quality and diverse images whose patch distribution lies in the joint patch distribution of a small number of N>1 training samples. The method is, in essence, a hierarchical patch-GAN that applies quantization at the first coarse scale, in a similar fashion to VQ-GAN, followed by a pyramid of residual fully convolutional GANs at finer scales. Our key idea is to first use quantization to learn a fixed set of patch embeddings for training images. We then use a separate set of side images to model the structure of generated images using an autoregressive model trained on the learned patch embeddings of training images. Using quantization at the coarsest scale allows the model to generate both conditional and unconditional novel images. Subsequently, a patch-GAN renders the fine details, resulting in high-quality images. In an extensive set of experiments, it is shown that FewGAN outperforms baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively.

> Self-driving cars (SDC) commonly implement the perception pipeline to detect the surrounding obstacles and track their moving trajectories, which lays the ground for the subsequent driving decision making process. Although the security of obstacle detection in SDC is intensively studied, not until very recently the attackers start to exploit the vulnerability of the tracking module. Compared with solely attacking the object detectors, this new attack strategy influences the driving decision more effectively with less attack budgets. However, little is known on whether the revealed vulnerability remains effective in end-to-end self-driving systems and, if so, how to mitigate the threat.   In this paper, we present the first systematic research on the security of object tracking in SDC. Through a comprehensive case study on the full perception pipeline of a popular open-sourced self-driving system, Baidu's Apollo, we prove the mainstream multi-object tracker (MOT) based on Kalman Filter (KF) is unsafe even with an enabled multi-sensor fusion mechanism. Our root cause analysis reveals, the vulnerability is innate to the design of KF-based MOT, which shall error-handle the prediction results from the object detectors yet the adopted KF algorithm is prone to trust the observation more when its deviation from the prediction is larger. To address this design flaw, we propose a simple yet effective security patch for KF-based MOT, the core of which is an adaptive strategy to balance the focus of KF on observations and predictions according to the anomaly index of the observation-prediction deviation, and has certified effectiveness against a generalized hijacking attack model. Extensive evaluation on $4$ KF-based existing MOT implementations (including 2D and 3D, academic and Apollo ones) validate the defense effectiveness and the trivial performance overhead of our approach.

> With the rapid increasing number of open source software (OSS), the majority of the software vulnerabilities in the open source components are fixed silently, which leads to the deployed software that integrated them being unable to get a timely update. Hence, it is critical to design a security patch identification system to ensure the security of the utilized software. However, most of the existing works for security patch identification just consider the changed code and the commit message of a commit as a flat sequence of tokens with simple neural networks to learn its semantics, while the structure information is ignored. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose our well-designed approach E-SPI, which extracts the structure information hidden in a commit for effective identification. Specifically, it consists of the code change encoder to extract the syntactic of the changed code with the BiLSTM to learn the code representation and the message encoder to construct the dependency graph for the commit message with the graph neural network (GNN) to learn the message representation. We further enhance the code change encoder by embedding contextual information related to the changed code. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct the extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art approaches on the existing dataset and from the real deployment environment. The experimental results confirm that our approach can significantly outperform current state-of-the-art baselines.

> Recent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown impressive results in learning visual representations from unlabeled images. This paper aims to improve their performance further by utilizing the architectural advantages of the underlying neural network, as the current state-of-the-art visual pretext tasks for SSL do not enjoy the benefit, i.e., they are architecture-agnostic. In particular, we focus on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which have gained much attention recently as a better architectural choice, often outperforming convolutional networks for various visual tasks. The unique characteristic of ViT is that it takes a sequence of disjoint patches from an image and processes patch-level representations internally. Inspired by this, we design a simple yet effective visual pretext task, coined SelfPatch, for learning better patch-level representations. To be specific, we enforce invariance against each patch and its neighbors, i.e., each patch treats similar neighboring patches as positive samples. Consequently, training ViTs with SelfPatch learns more semantically meaningful relations among patches (without using human-annotated labels), which can be beneficial, in particular, to downstream tasks of a dense prediction type. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that it can significantly improve the performance of existing SSL methods for various visual tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation. Specifically, SelfPatch significantly improves the recent self-supervised ViT, DINO, by achieving +1.3 AP on COCO object detection, +1.2 AP on COCO instance segmentation, and +2.9 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

> Self-supervised pre-training techniques have achieved remarkable progress in Document AI. Most multimodal pre-trained models use a masked language modeling objective to learn bidirectional representations on the text modality, but they differ in pre-training objectives for the image modality. This discrepancy adds difficulty to multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LayoutLMv3} to pre-train multimodal Transformers for Document AI with unified text and image masking. Additionally, LayoutLMv3 is pre-trained with a word-patch alignment objective to learn cross-modal alignment by predicting whether the corresponding image patch of a text word is masked. The simple unified architecture and training objectives make LayoutLMv3 a general-purpose pre-trained model for both text-centric and image-centric Document AI tasks. Experimental results show that LayoutLMv3 achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in text-centric tasks, including form understanding, receipt understanding, and document visual question answering, but also in image-centric tasks such as document image classification and document layout analysis. The code and models are publicly available at \url{https://aka.ms/layoutlmv3}.

> Manipulation of biomedical images to misrepresent experimental results has plagued the biomedical community for a while. Recent interest in the problem led to the curation of a dataset and associated tasks to promote the development of biomedical forensic methods. Of these, the largest manipulation detection task focuses on the detection of duplicated regions between images. Traditional computer-vision based forensic models trained on natural images are not designed to overcome the challenges presented by biomedical images. We propose a multi-scale overlap detection model to detect duplicated image regions. Our model is structured to find duplication hierarchically, so as to reduce the number of patch operations. It achieves state-of-the-art performance overall and on multiple biomedical image categories.

> Most image-to-image translation methods require a large number of training images, which restricts their applicability. We instead propose ManiFest: a framework for few-shot image translation that learns a context-aware representation of a target domain from a few images only. To enforce feature consistency, our framework learns a style manifold between source and proxy anchor domains (assumed to be composed of large numbers of images). The learned manifold is interpolated and deformed towards the few-shot target domain via patch-based adversarial and feature statistics alignment losses. All of these components are trained simultaneously during a single end-to-end loop. In addition to the general few-shot translation task, our approach can alternatively be conditioned on a single exemplar image to reproduce its specific style. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ManiFest on multiple tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art on all metrics and in both the general- and exemplar-based scenarios.

> In recent years, significant progress has been achieved for 3D object detection on point clouds thanks to the advances in 3D data collection and deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, 3D scenes exhibit a lot of variations and are prone to sensor inaccuracies as well as information loss during pre-processing. Thus, it is crucial to design techniques that are robust against these variations. This requires a detailed analysis and understanding of the effect of such variations. This work aims to analyze and benchmark popular point-based 3D object detectors against several data corruptions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the robustness of point-based 3D object detectors. To this end, we design and evaluate corruptions that involve data addition, reduction, and alteration. We further study the robustness of different modules against local and global variations. Our experimental results reveal several intriguing findings. For instance, we show that methods that integrate Transformers at a patch or object level lead to increased robustness, compared to using Transformers at the point level.

> Advances in computer vision are pushing the limits of im-age manipulation, with generative models sampling detailed images on various tasks. However, a specialized model is often developed and trained for each specific task, even though many image edition tasks share similarities. In denoising, inpainting, or image compositing, one always aims at generating a realistic image from a low-quality one. In this paper, we aim at making a step towards a unified approach for image editing. To do so, we propose EdiBERT, a bi-directional transformer trained in the discrete latent space built by a vector-quantized auto-encoder. We argue that such a bidirectional model is suited for image manipulation since any patch can be re-sampled conditionally to the whole image. Using this unique and straightforward training objective, we show that the resulting model matches state-of-the-art performances on a wide variety of tasks: image denoising, image completion, and image composition.

> We present NeRF-SR, a solution for high-resolution (HR) novel view synthesis with mostly low-resolution (LR) inputs. Our method is built upon Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that predicts per-point density and color with a multi-layer perceptron. While producing images at arbitrary scales, NeRF struggles with resolutions that go beyond observed images. Our key insight is that NeRF benefits from 3D consistency, which means an observed pixel absorbs information from nearby views. We first exploit it by a supersampling strategy that shoots multiple rays at each image pixel, which further enforces multi-view constraint at a sub-pixel level. Then, we show that NeRF-SR can further boost the performance of supersampling by a refinement network that leverages the estimated depth at hand to hallucinate details from related patches on only one HR reference image. Experiment results demonstrate that NeRF-SR generates high-quality results for novel view synthesis at HR on both synthetic and real-world datasets without any external information.

> We present a novel methodology for repairing neural networks that use ReLU activation functions. Unlike existing methods that rely on modifying the weights of a neural network which can induce a global change in the function space, our approach applies only a localized change in the function space while still guaranteeing the removal of the buggy behavior. By leveraging the piecewise linear nature of ReLU networks, our approach can efficiently construct a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input resides, which when combined with the original network, provably corrects the behavior on the buggy input. Our method is both sound and complete -- the repaired network is guaranteed to fix the buggy input, and a patch is guaranteed to be found for any buggy input. Moreover, our approach preserves the continuous piecewise linear nature of ReLU networks, automatically generalizes the repair to all the points including other undetected buggy inputs inside the repair region, is minimal in terms of changes in the function space, and guarantees that outputs on inputs away from the repair region are unaltered. On several benchmarks, we show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of locality and limiting negative side effects.

> Deep learning based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have achieved strong performance in medical image segmentation, which can alleviate doctors' expensive annotation by utilizing a large amount of unlabeled data. Unlike most existing semi-supervised learning methods, adversarial training based methods distinguish samples from different sources by learning the data distribution of the segmentation map, leading the segmenter to generate more accurate predictions. We argue that the current performance restrictions for such approaches are the problems of feature extraction and learning preference. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised adversarial method called Patch Confidence Adversarial Training (PCA) for medical image segmentation. Rather than single scalar classification results or pixel-level confidence maps, our proposed discriminator creates patch confidence maps and classifies them at the scale of the patches. The prediction of unlabeled data learns the pixel structure and context information in each patch to get enough gradient feedback, which aids the discriminator in convergent to an optimal state and improves semi-supervised segmentation performance. Furthermore, at the discriminator's input, we supplement semantic information constraints on images, making it simpler for unlabeled data to fit the expected data distribution. Extensive experiments on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) 2017 dataset and the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2019 challenge dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, which demonstrates its effectiveness for medical image segmentation.

> The unabated mystique of large-scale neural networks, such as the CLIP dual image-and-text encoder, popularized automatically generated art. Increasingly more sophisticated generators enhanced the artworks' realism and visual appearance, and creative prompt engineering enabled stylistic expression. Guided by an artist-in-the-loop ideal, we design a gradient-based generator to produce collages. It requires the human artist to curate libraries of image patches and to describe (with prompts) the whole image composition, with the option to manually adjust the patches' positions during generation, thereby allowing humans to reclaim some control of the process and achieve greater creative freedom. We explore the aesthetic potentials of high-resolution collages, and provide an open-source Google Colab as an artistic tool.

> Current visual question answering (VQA) tasks mainly consider answering human-annotated questions for natural images. However, aside from natural images, abstract diagrams with semantic richness are still understudied in visual understanding and reasoning research. In this work, we introduce a new challenge of Icon Question Answering (IconQA) with the goal of answering a question in an icon image context. We release IconQA, a large-scale dataset that consists of 107,439 questions and three sub-tasks: multi-image-choice, multi-text-choice, and filling-in-the-blank. The IconQA dataset is inspired by real-world diagram word problems that highlight the importance of abstract diagram understanding and comprehensive cognitive reasoning. Thus, IconQA requires not only perception skills like object recognition and text understanding, but also diverse cognitive reasoning skills, such as geometric reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning. To facilitate potential IconQA models to learn semantic representations for icon images, we further release an icon dataset Icon645 which contains 645,687 colored icons on 377 classes. We conduct extensive user studies and blind experiments and reproduce a wide range of advanced VQA methods to benchmark the IconQA task. Also, we develop a strong IconQA baseline Patch-TRM that applies a pyramid cross-modal Transformer with input diagram embeddings pre-trained on the icon dataset. IconQA and Icon645 are available at https://iconqa.github.io.

> Deep neural networks are vulnerable to attacks from adversarial inputs and, more recently, Trojans to misguide or hijack the model's decision. We expose the existence of an intriguing class of spatially bounded, physically realizable, adversarial examples -- Universal NaTuralistic adversarial paTches -- we call TnTs, by exploring the superset of the spatially bounded adversarial example space and the natural input space within generative adversarial networks. Now, an adversary can arm themselves with a patch that is naturalistic, less malicious-looking, physically realizable, highly effective achieving high attack success rates, and universal. A TnT is universal because any input image captured with a TnT in the scene will: i) misguide a network (untargeted attack); or ii) force the network to make a malicious decision (targeted attack). Interestingly, now, an adversarial patch attacker has the potential to exert a greater level of control -- the ability to choose a location-independent, natural-looking patch as a trigger in contrast to being constrained to noisy perturbations -- an ability is thus far shown to be only possible with Trojan attack methods needing to interfere with the model building processes to embed a backdoor at the risk discovery; but, still realize a patch deployable in the physical world. Through extensive experiments on the large-scale visual classification task, ImageNet with evaluations across its entire validation set of 50,000 images, we demonstrate the realistic threat from TnTs and the robustness of the attack. We show a generalization of the attack to create patches achieving higher attack success rates than existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results show the generalizability of the attack to different visual classification tasks (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, PubFig) and multiple state-of-the-art deep neural networks such as WideResnet50, Inception-V3 and VGG-16.

> Transformer-based methods have recently achieved great advancement on 2D image-based vision tasks. For 3D video-based tasks such as action recognition, however, directly applying spatiotemporal transformers on video data will bring heavy computation and memory burdens due to the largely increased number of patches and the quadratic complexity of self-attention computation. How to efficiently and effectively model the 3D self-attention of video data has been a great challenge for transformers. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Patch Shift (TPS) method for efficient 3D self-attention modeling in transformers for video-based action recognition. TPS shifts part of patches with a specific mosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, thus converting a vanilla spatial self-attention operation to a spatiotemporal one with little additional cost. As a result, we can compute 3D self-attention using nearly the same computation and memory cost as 2D self-attention. TPS is a plug-and-play module and can be inserted into existing 2D transformer models to enhance spatiotemporal feature learning. The proposed method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-arts on Something-something V1 & V2, Diving-48, and Kinetics400 while being much more efficient on computation and memory cost. The source code of TPS can be found at https://github.com/MartinXM/TPS.

> We aim to demonstrate the value of mathematical models for policy debates about technological progress in cybersecurity by considering phishing, vulnerability discovery, and the dynamics between patching and exploitation. We then adjust the inputs to those mathematical models to match some possible advances in their underlying technology. We find that AI's impact on phishing may be overestimated but could lead to more attacks going undetected. Advances in vulnerability discovery have the potential to help attackers more than defenders. And automation that writes exploits is more useful to attackers than automation that writes patches, although advances that help deploy patches faster have the potential to be more impactful than either.

> Adapting Deep Learning (DL) techniques to automate non-trivial coding activities, such as code documentation and defect detection, has been intensively studied recently. Learning to predict code changes is one of the popular and essential investigations. Prior studies have shown that DL techniques such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT) can benefit meaningful code changes, including bug fixing and code refactoring. However, NMT models may encounter bottleneck when modeling long sequences, thus are limited in accurately predicting code changes. In this work, we design a Transformer-based approach, considering that Transformer has proven effective in capturing long-term dependencies. Specifically, we propose a novel model named DTrans. For better incorporating the local structure of code, i.e., statement-level information in this paper, DTrans is designed with dynamically relative position encoding in the multi-head attention of Transformer. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTrans can more accurately generate patches than the state-of-the-art methods, increasing the performance by at least 5.45\%-46.57\% in terms of the exact match metric on different datasets. Moreover, DTrans can locate the lines to change with 1.75\%-24.21\% higher accuracy than the existing methods.

> One of the key challenges in high speed off road navigation on ground vehicles is that the kinodynamics of the vehicle terrain interaction can differ dramatically depending on the terrain. Previous approaches to addressing this challenge have considered learning an inverse kinodynamics (IKD) model, conditioned on inertial information of the vehicle to sense the kinodynamic interactions. In this paper, we hypothesize that to enable accurate high-speed off-road navigation using a learned IKD model, in addition to inertial information from the past, one must also anticipate the kinodynamic interactions of the vehicle with the terrain in the future. To this end, we introduce Visual-Inertial Inverse Kinodynamics (VI-IKD), a novel learning based IKD model that is conditioned on visual information from a terrain patch ahead of the robot in addition to past inertial information, enabling it to anticipate kinodynamic interactions in the future. We validate the effectiveness of VI-IKD in accurate high-speed off-road navigation experimentally on a scale 1/5 UT-AlphaTruck off-road autonomous vehicle in both indoor and outdoor environments and show that compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, VI-IKD enables more accurate and robust off-road navigation on a variety of different terrains at speeds of up to 3.5 m/s.

> To avoid costly security patching after software deployment, security-by-design techniques (e.g., STRIDE threat analysis) are adopted in organizations to root out security issues before the system is ever implemented. Despite the global gap in cybersecurity workforce and the high manual effort required for performing threat analysis, organizations are ramping up threat analysis activities. However, past experimental results were inconclusive regarding some performance indicators of threat analysis techniques thus practitioners have little evidence for choosing the technique to adopt. To address this issue, we replicated a controlled experiment with STRIDE. Our study was aimed at measuring and comparing the performance indicators (productivity and precision) of two STRIDE variants (element and interaction). We conclude the paper by comparing our results to the original study.

> Generative models operate at fixed resolution, even though natural images come in a variety of sizes. As high-resolution details are downsampled away and low-resolution images are discarded altogether, precious supervision is lost. We argue that every pixel matters and create datasets with variable-size images, collected at their native resolutions. To take advantage of varied-size data, we introduce continuous-scale training, a process that samples patches at random scales to train a new generator with variable output resolutions. First, conditioning the generator on a target scale allows us to generate higher resolution images than previously possible, without adding layers to the model. Second, by conditioning on continuous coordinates, we can sample patches that still obey a consistent global layout, which also allows for scalable training at higher resolutions. Controlled FFHQ experiments show that our method can take advantage of multi-resolution training data better than discrete multi-scale approaches, achieving better FID scores and cleaner high-frequency details. We also train on other natural image domains including churches, mountains, and birds, and demonstrate arbitrary scale synthesis with both coherent global layouts and realistic local details, going beyond 2K resolution in our experiments.

> Forking is a common practice for developers when building upon on already existing projects. These forks create variants, which have a common code base but then evolve the code in different directions, which is specific to that forked project requirements. An interesting side-effect of having multiple forks is the ability to select between different evolution directions of the code which is based on developers fixing bugs in the code base. However, the key issue that this decentralized form of information is difficult to analyze. In this study, we propose a visualization to analyze active changes in fork repositories that have not been merged back to the original project. Our visualization shows code commit activities in multiple forks with highlight on bug fix commits in the history of forks. While the commit activity of each repository is visualized similarly to the code frequency view of GitHub, our view shows only commits unique to fork repositories. To illustrate the effectiveness of our visualization, we have applied our view to two use cases: identifying forks from a repository no longer maintained, and identifying a bug fix among forks. In the first case, we identify a fork of a suspended project named Obfuscator-LLVM. Our view shows the original repository and its most active fork that continue the development on the top. In the second case, we identify a bug fix in a fork of Clipy project. Our view shows that the most active fork has its own bug fixes; we could easily identify a patch for the bug highlighted in the view. As a new ideas paper, we then present our outline of three research questions to spark real world use-cases and goals for our visualization has the potential to uncover.

> Despite the recent success of artificial neural networks, more biologically plausible learning methods may be needed to resolve the weaknesses of backpropagation trained models such as catastrophic forgetting and adversarial attacks. Although these weaknesses are not specifically addressed, a novel local learning rule is presented that performs online clustering with an upper limit on the number of clusters to be found rather than a fixed cluster count. Instead of using orthogonal weight or output activation constraints, activation sparsity is achieved by mutual repulsion of lateral Gaussian neurons ensuring that multiple neuron centers cannot occupy the same location in the input domain. An update method is also presented for adjusting the widths of the Gaussian neurons in cases where the data samples can be represented by means and variances. The algorithms were applied on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to create filters capturing the input patterns of pixel patches of various sizes. The experimental results demonstrate stability in the learned parameters across a large number of training samples.

> Integrating multimodal knowledge for abstractive summarization task is a work-in-progress research area, with present techniques inheriting fusion-then-generation paradigm. Due to semantic gaps between computer vision and natural language processing, current methods often treat multiple data points as separate objects and rely on attention mechanisms to search for connection in order to fuse together. In addition, missing awareness of cross-modal matching from many frameworks leads to performance reduction. To solve these two drawbacks, we propose an Iterative Contrastive Alignment Framework (ICAF) that uses recurrent alignment and contrast to capture the coherences between images and texts. Specifically, we design a recurrent alignment (RA) layer to gradually investigate fine-grained semantical relationships between image patches and text tokens. At each step during the encoding process, cross-modal contrastive losses are applied to directly optimize the embedding space. According to ROUGE, relevance scores, and human evaluation, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on MSMO dataset. Experiments on the applicability of our proposed framework and hyperparameters settings have been also conducted.

> Maintaining a resilient computer network is a delicate task with conflicting priorities. Flows should be served while controlling risk due to attackers. Upon publication of a vulnerability, administrators scramble to manually mitigate risk while waiting for a patch.   We introduce FASHION: a linear optimizer that balances routing flows with the security risk posed by these flows. FASHION formalizes routing as a multi-commodity flow problem with side constraints. FASHION formulates security using two approximations of risk in a probabilistic attack graph (Frigault et al., Network Security Metrics 2017). FASHION's output is a set of software-defined networking rules consumable by Frenetic (Foster et al., ICFP 2011).   We introduce a topology generation tool that creates data center network instances including flows and vulnerabilities. FASHION is executed on instances of up to 600 devices, thousands of flows, and million edge attack graphs. Solve time averages 30 minutes on the largest instances (seconds on the smallest instances). To ensure the security objective is accurate, the output solution is assessed using risk as defined by Frigault et al.   FASHION allows enterprises to reconfigure their network in response to changes in functionality or security requirements.

> A critical step in the fight against COVID-19, which continues to have a catastrophic impact on peoples lives, is the effective screening of patients presented in the clinics with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Chest radiography is one of the promising screening approaches. Many studies reported detecting COVID-19 in chest X-rays accurately using deep learning. A serious limitation of many published approaches is insufficient attention paid to explaining decisions made by deep learning models. Using explainable artificial intelligence methods, we demonstrate that model decisions may rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology. After an analysis of potential confounding factors found on chest X-ray images, we propose a novel method to minimise their negative impact. We show that our proposed method is more robust than previous attempts to counter confounding factors such as ECG leads in chest X-rays that often influence model classification decisions. In addition to being robust, our method achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at (https://github.com/tomek1911/POTHER).

> The arm race between hardware security engineers and side-channel researchers has become more competitive with more sophisticated attacks and defenses in the last decade. While modern hardware features improve the system performance significantly, they may create new attack surfaces for malicious people to extract sensitive information about users without physical access to the victim device. Although many previously exploited hardware and OS features were patched by OS developers and chip vendors, any feature that is accessible from userspace applications can be exploited to perform software-based side-channel attacks.   In this paper, we present DF-SCA, which is a software-based dynamic frequency side-channel attack on Linux and Android OS devices. We exploit unprivileged access to cpufreq interface that exposes real-time CPU core frequency values directly correlated with the system utilization, creating a reliable side-channel for attackers. We show that Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) feature in modern systems can be utilized to perform website fingerprinting attacks for Google Chrome and Tor browsers on modern Intel, AMD, and ARM architectures. We further extend our analysis to a wide selection of scaling governors on Intel and AMD CPUs, verifying that all scaling governors provide enough information on the visited web page. Moreover, we extract properties of keystroke patterns on frequency readings, that leads to 95% accuracy to distinguish the keystrokes from other activities on Android phones. We leverage inter-keystroke timings of a user by training a k-th nearest neighbor model, which achieves 88% password recovery rate in the first guess on Bank of America application. Finally, we propose several countermeasures to mask the user activity to mitigate DF-SCA on Linux-based systems.

> We analyze the effect of offline and online triplet mining for colorectal cancer (CRC) histopathology dataset containing 100,000 patches. We consider the extreme, i.e., farthest and nearest patches to a given anchor, both in online and offline mining. While many works focus solely on selecting the triplets online (batch-wise), we also study the effect of extreme distances and neighbor patches before training in an offline fashion. We analyze extreme cases' impacts in terms of embedding distance for offline versus online mining, including easy positive, batch semi-hard, batch hard triplet mining, neighborhood component analysis loss, its proxy version, and distance weighted sampling. We also investigate online approaches based on extreme distance and comprehensively compare offline, and online mining performance based on the data patterns and explain offline mining as a tractable generalization of the online mining with large mini-batch size. As well, we discuss the relations of different colorectal tissue types in terms of extreme distances. We found that offline and online mining approaches have comparable performances for a specific architecture, such as ResNet-18 in this study. Moreover, we found the assorted case, including different extreme distances, is promising, especially in the online approach.

> Tensor completion is the problem of estimating the missing values of high-order data from partially observed entries. Data corruption due to prevailing outliers poses major challenges to traditional tensor completion algorithms, which catalyzed the development of robust algorithms that alleviate the effect of outliers. However, existing robust methods largely presume that the corruption is sparse, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we develop a two-stage robust tensor completion approach to deal with tensor completion of visual data with a large amount of gross corruption. A novel coarse-to-fine framework is proposed which uses a global coarse completion result to guide a local patch refinement process. To efficiently mitigate the effect of a large number of outliers on tensor recovery, we develop a new M-estimator-based robust tensor ring recovery method which can adaptively identify the outliers and alleviate their negative effect in the optimization. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art robust algorithms for tensor completion.

> Tensor completion aims to recover the missing entries of a partially observed tensor by exploiting its low-rank structure, and has been applied to visual data recovery. In applications where the data arrives sequentially such as streaming video completion, the missing entries of the tensor need to be dynamically recovered in a streaming fashion. Traditional streaming tensor completion algorithms treat the entire visual data as a tensor, which may not work satisfactorily when there is a big change in the tensor subspace along the temporal dimension, such as due to strong motion across the video frames. In this paper, we develop a novel patch tracking-based streaming tensor ring completion framework for visual data recovery. Given a newly incoming frame, small patches are tracked from the previous frame. Meanwhile, for each tracked patch, a patch tensor is constructed by stacking similar patches from the new frame. Patch tensors are then completed using a streaming tensor ring completion algorithm, and the incoming frame is recovered using the completed patch tensors. We propose a new patch tracking strategy that can accurately and efficiently track the patches with missing data. Further, a new streaming tensor ring completion algorithm is proposed which can efficiently and accurately update the latent core tensors and complete the missing entries of the patch tensors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms compared with both batch and streaming state-of-the-art tensor completion methods.

> Backdoor attacks have been shown to be a serious security threat against deep learning models, and detecting whether a given model has been backdoored becomes a crucial task. Existing defenses are mainly built upon the observation that the backdoor trigger is usually of small size or affects the activation of only a few neurons. However, the above observations are violated in many cases especially for advanced backdoor attacks, hindering the performance and applicability of the existing defenses. In this paper, we propose a backdoor defense DTInspector built upon a new observation. That is, an effective backdoor attack usually requires high prediction confidence on the poisoned training samples, so as to ensure that the trained model exhibits the targeted behavior with a high probability. Based on this observation, DTInspector first learns a patch that could change the predictions of most high-confidence data, and then decides the existence of backdoor by checking the ratio of prediction changes after applying the learned patch on the low-confidence data. Extensive evaluations on five backdoor attacks, four datasets, and three advanced attacking types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense.

> Multi-instance learning (MIL) is widely used in the computer-aided interpretation of pathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to solve the lack of pixel-wise or patch-wise annotations. Often, this approach directly applies "natural image driven" MIL algorithms which overlook the multi-scale (i.e. pyramidal) nature of WSIs. Off-the-shelf MIL algorithms are typically deployed on a single-scale of WSIs (e.g., 20x magnification), while human pathologists usually aggregate the global and local patterns in a multi-scale manner (e.g., by zooming in and out between different magnifications). In this study, we propose a novel cross-scale attention mechanism to explicitly aggregate inter-scale interactions into a single MIL network for Crohn's Disease (CD), which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) a cross-scale attention mechanism is proposed to aggregate features from different resolutions with multi-scale interaction; and (2) differential multi-scale attention visualizations are generated to localize explainable lesion patterns. By training ~250,000 H&E-stained Ascending Colon (AC) patches from 20 CD patient and 30 healthy control samples at different scales, our approach achieved a superior Area under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.8924 compared with baseline models.

> The rapid and widespread adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has called for ways to test their behaviour, and many testing approaches have successfully revealed misbehaviour of DNNs. However, it is relatively unclear what one can do to correct such behaviour after revelation, as retraining involves costly data collection and does not guarantee to fix the underlying issue. This paper introduces Arachne, a novel program repair technique for DNNs, which directly repairs DNNs using their input-output pairs as a specification. Arachne localises neural weights on which it can generate effective patches and uses Differential Evolution to optimise the localised weights and correct the misbehaviour. An empirical study using different benchmarks shows that Arachne can fix specific misclassifications of a DNN without reducing general accuracy significantly. On average, patches generated by Arachne generalise to 61.3% of unseen misbehaviour, whereas those by a state-of-the-art DNN repair technique generalise only to 10.2% and sometimes to none while taking tens of times more than Arachne. We also show that Arachne can address fairness issues by debiasing a gender classification model. Finally, we successfully apply Arachne to a text sentiment model to show that it generalises beyond Convolutional Neural Networks.

> Nowadays, an increasing number of applications uses deserialization. This technique, based on rebuilding the instance of objects from serialized byte streams, can be dangerous since it can open the application to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) if the data to deserialize is originating from an untrusted source. Deserialization vulnerabilities are so critical that they are in OWASP's list of top 10 security risks for web applications. This is mainly caused by faults in the development process of applications and by flaws in their dependencies, i.e., flaws in the libraries used by these applications. No previous work has studied deserialization attacks in-depth: How are they performed? How are weaknesses introduced and patched? And for how long are vulnerabilities present in the codebase? To yield a deeper understanding of this important kind of vulnerability, we perform two main analyses: one on attack gadgets, i.e., exploitable pieces of code, present in Java libraries, and one on vulnerabilities present in Java applications. For the first analysis, we conduct an exploratory large-scale study by running 256515 experiments in which we vary the versions of libraries for each of the 19 publicly available exploits. Such attacks rely on a combination of gadgets present in one or multiple Java libraries. A gadget is a method which is using objects or fields that can be attacker-controlled. Our goal is to precisely identify library versions containing gadgets and to understand how gadgets have been introduced and how they have been patched. We observe that the modification of one innocent-looking detail in a class -- such as making it public -- can already introduce a gadget. Furthermore, we noticed that among the studied libraries, 37.5% are not patched, leaving gadgets available for future attacks. For the second analysis, we manually analyze 104 deserialization vulnerabilities CVEs to understand how vulnerabilities are introduced and patched in real-life Java applications. Results indicate that the vulnerabilities are not always completely patched or that a workaround solution is proposed. With a workaround solution, applications are still vulnerable since the code itself is unchanged.

> In this paper, we propose a method using the fusion of CNN and transformer structure to improve image classification performance. In the case of CNN, information about a local area on an image can be extracted well, but there is a limit to the extraction of global information. On the other hand, the transformer has an advantage in relatively global extraction, but has a disadvantage in that it requires a lot of memory for local feature value extraction. In the case of an image, it is converted into a feature map through CNN, and each feature map's pixel is considered a token. At the same time, the image is divided into patch areas and then fused with the transformer method that views them as tokens. For the fusion of tokens with two different characteristics, we propose three methods: (1) late token fusion with parallel structure, (2) early token fusion, (3) token fusion in a layer by layer. In an experiment using ImageNet 1k, the proposed method shows the best classification performance.

> DNN-based video object detection (VOD) powers autonomous driving and video surveillance industries with rising importance and promising opportunities. However, adversarial patch attack yields huge concern in live vision tasks because of its practicality, feasibility, and powerful attack effectiveness. This work proposes Themis, a software/hardware system to defend against adversarial patches for real-time robust video object detection. We observe that adversarial patches exhibit extremely localized superficial feature importance in a small region with non-robust predictions, and thus propose the adversarial region detection algorithm for adversarial effect elimination. Themis also proposes a systematic design to efficiently support the algorithm by eliminating redundant computations and memory traffics. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can effectively recover the system from the adversarial attack with negligible hardware overhead.

> For the first time, we propose using a multiple instance learning based convolution-free transformer model, called Multiple Instance Neuroimage Transformer (MINiT), for the classification of T1weighted (T1w) MRIs. We first present several variants of transformer models adopted for neuroimages. These models extract non-overlapping 3D blocks from the input volume and perform multi-headed self-attention on a sequence of their linear projections. MINiT, on the other hand, treats each of the non-overlapping 3D blocks of the input MRI as its own instance, splitting it further into non-overlapping 3D patches, on which multi-headed self-attention is computed. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate the efficacy of our model by training it to identify sex from T1w-MRIs of two public datasets: Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). The learned attention maps highlight voxels contributing to identifying sex differences in brain morphometry. The code is available at https://github.com/singlaayush/MINIT.

> Assessing microsatellite stability status of a patient's colorectal cancer is crucial in personalizing treatment regime. Recently, convolutional-neural-networks (CNN) combined with transfer-learning approaches were proposed to circumvent traditional laboratory testing for determining microsatellite status from hematoxylin and eosin stained biopsy whole slide images (WSI). However, the high resolution of WSI practically prevent direct classification of the entire WSI. Current approaches bypass the WSI high resolution by first classifying small patches extracted from the WSI, and then aggregating patch-level classification logits to deduce the patient-level status. Such approaches limit the capacity to capture important information which resides at the high resolution WSI data. We introduce an effective approach to leverage WSI high resolution information by momentum contrastive learning of patch embeddings along with training a patient-level classifier on groups of those embeddings. Our approach achieves up to 7.4\% better accuracy compared to the straightforward patch-level classification and patient level aggregation approach with a higher stability (AUC, $0.91 \pm 0.01$ vs. $0.85 \pm 0.04$, p-value$<0.01$).

> Taking into account information across the temporal domain helps to improve environment perception in autonomous driving. However, it has not been studied so far whether temporally fused neural networks are vulnerable to deliberately generated perturbations, i.e. adversarial attacks, or whether temporal history is an inherent defense against them. In this work, we study whether temporal feature networks for object detection are vulnerable to universal adversarial attacks. We evaluate attacks of two types: imperceptible noise for the whole image and locally-bound adversarial patch. In both cases, perturbations are generated in a white-box manner using PGD. Our experiments confirm, that attacking even a portion of a temporal input suffices to fool the network. We visually assess generated perturbations to gain insights into the functioning of attacks. To enhance the robustness, we apply adversarial training using 5-PGD. Our experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate, that a model robustified via K-PGD is able to withstand the studied attacks while keeping the mAP-based performance comparable to that of an unattacked model.

> Recently, masked image modeling (MIM) has gained considerable attention due to its capacity to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data and has been demonstrated to be effective on a wide variety of vision tasks involving natural images. Meanwhile, the potential of self-supervised learning in modeling 3D medical images is anticipated to be immense due to the high quantities of unlabeled images, and the expense and difficulty of quality labels. However, MIM's applicability to medical images remains uncertain. In this paper, we demonstrate that masked image modeling approaches can also advance 3D medical images analysis in addition to natural images. We study how masked image modeling strategies leverage performance from the viewpoints of 3D medical image segmentation as a representative downstream task: i) when compared to naive contrastive learning, masked image modeling approaches accelerate the convergence of supervised training even faster (1.40$\times$) and ultimately produce a higher dice score; ii) predicting raw voxel values with a high masking ratio and a relatively smaller patch size is non-trivial self-supervised pretext-task for medical images modeling; iii) a lightweight decoder or projection head design for reconstruction is powerful for masked image modeling on 3D medical images which speeds up training and reduce cost; iv) finally, we also investigate the effectiveness of MIM methods under different practical scenarios where different image resolutions and labeled data ratios are applied.

> Near-Periodic Patterns (NPP) are ubiquitous in man-made scenes and are composed of tiled motifs with appearance differences caused by lighting, defects, or design elements. A good NPP representation is useful for many applications including image completion, segmentation, and geometric remapping. But representing NPP is challenging because it needs to maintain global consistency (tiled motifs layout) while preserving local variations (appearance differences). Methods trained on general scenes using a large dataset or single-image optimization struggle to satisfy these constraints, while methods that explicitly model periodicity are not robust to periodicity detection errors. To address these challenges, we learn a neural implicit representation using a coordinate-based MLP with single image optimization. We design an input feature warping module and a periodicity-guided patch loss to handle both global consistency and local variations. To further improve the robustness, we introduce a periodicity proposal module to search and use multiple candidate periodicities in our pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on more than 500 images of building facades, friezes, wallpapers, ground, and Mondrian patterns on single and multi-planar scenes.

> Model transformations play an essential role in the Model-Driven Engineering paradigm. Writing a correct transformation program requires to be proficient with the source and target modeling languages, to have a clear understanding of the mapping between the elements of the two, as well as to master the transformation language to properly describe the transformation. Transformation programs are thus complex and error-prone, and finding and fixing errors in such programs typically involve a tedious and time-consuming effort by developers. In this paper, we propose a novel search-based approach to automatically repair transformation programs containing many semantic errors. To prevent the fitness plateaus and the single fitness peak limitations, we leverage the notion of social diversity to promote repair patches tackling errors that are less covered by the other patches of the population. We evaluate our approach on 71 semantically incorrect transformation programs written in ATL, and containing up to five semantic errors simultaneously. The evaluation shows that integrating social diversity when searching for repair patches allows to improve the quality of those patches and to speed up the convergence even when up to five semantic errors are involved.

> A novel method for access control with a secret key is proposed to protect models from unauthorized access in this paper. We focus on semantic segmentation models with the vision transformer (ViT), called segmentation transformer (SETR). Most existing access control methods focus on image classification tasks, or they are limited to CNNs. By using a patch embedding structure that ViT has, trained models and test images can be efficiently encrypted with a secret key, and then semantic segmentation tasks are carried out in the encrypted domain. In an experiment, the method is confirmed to provide the same accuracy as that of using plain images without any encryption to authorized users with a correct key and also to provide an extremely degraded accuracy to unauthorized users.

> In this study, a radiomics approach was extended to optical fluorescence molecular imaging data for tissue classification, termed 'optomics'. Fluorescence molecular imaging is emerging for precise surgical guidance during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) resection. However, the tumor-to-normal tissue contrast is confounded by intrinsic physiological limitations of heterogeneous expression of the target molecule, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Optomics seek to improve tumor identification by probing textural pattern differences in EGFR expression conveyed by fluorescence. A total of 1,472 standardized optomic features were extracted from fluorescence image samples. A supervised machine learning pipeline involving a support vector machine classifier was trained with 25 top-ranked features selected by minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion. Model predictive performance was compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method by classifying testing set image patches of resected tissue with histologically confirmed malignancy status. The optomics approach provided consistent improvement in prediction accuracy on all test set samples, irrespective of dose, compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method (mean accuracies of 89% vs. 81%; P = 0.0072). The improved performance demonstrates that extending the radiomics approach to fluorescence molecular imaging data offers a promising image analysis technique for cancer detection in fluorescence-guided surgery.

> While self-supervised learning has been shown to benefit a number of vision tasks, existing techniques mainly focus on image-level manipulation, which may not generalize well to downstream tasks at patch or pixel levels. Moreover, existing SSL methods might not sufficiently describe and associate the above representations within and across image scales. In this paper, we propose a Self-Supervised Pyramid Representation Learning (SS-PRL) framework. The proposed SS-PRL is designed to derive pyramid representations at patch levels via learning proper prototypes, with additional learners to observe and relate inherent semantic information within an image. In particular, we present a cross-scale patch-level correlation learning in SS-PRL, which allows the model to aggregate and associate information learned across patch scales. We show that, with our proposed SS-PRL for model pre-training, one can easily adapt and fine-tune the models for a variety of applications including multi-label classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.

> The intricacy of 3D surfaces often results cutting-edge point cloud denoising (PCD) models in surface degradation including remnant noise, wrongly-removed geometric details. Although using multi-scale patches to encode the geometry of a point has become the common wisdom in PCD, we find that simple aggregation of extracted multi-scale features can not adaptively utilize the appropriate scale information according to the geometric information around noisy points. It leads to surface degradation, especially for points close to edges and points on complex curved surfaces. We raise an intriguing question -- if employing multi-scale geometric perception information to guide the network to utilize multi-scale information, can eliminate the severe surface degradation problem? To answer it, we propose a Multi-offset Denoising Network (MODNet) customized for multi-scale patches. First, we extract the low-level feature of three scales patches by patch feature encoders. Second, a multi-scale perception module is designed to embed multi-scale geometric information for each scale feature and regress multi-scale weights to guide a multi-offset denoising displacement. Third, a multi-offset decoder regresses three scale offsets, which are guided by the multi-scale weights to predict the final displacement by weighting them adaptively. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets.

> In this work, we propose a novel perspective to the problem of patch correctness assessment: a correct patch implements changes that "answer" to a problem posed by buggy behaviour. Concretely, we turn the patch correctness assessment into a Question Answering problem. To tackle this problem, our intuition is that natural language processing can provide the necessary representations and models for assessing the semantic correlation between a bug (question) and a patch (answer). Specifically, we consider as inputs the bug reports as well as the natural language description of the generated patches. Our approach, Quatrain, first considers state of the art commit message generation models to produce the relevant inputs associated to each generated patch. Then we leverage a neural network architecture to learn the semantic correlation between bug reports and commit messages. Experiments on a large dataset of 9135 patches generated for three bug datasets (Defects4j, Bugs.jar and Bears) show that Quatrain can achieve an AUC of 0.886 on predicting patch correctness, and recalling 93% correct patches while filtering out 62% incorrect patches. Our experimental results further demonstrate the influence of inputs quality on prediction performance. We further perform experiments to highlight that the model indeed learns the relationship between bug reports and code change descriptions for the prediction. Finally, we compare against prior work and discuss the benefits of our approach.

> To enhance the compatibility in the version control of Java Third-party Libraries (TPLs), Maven adopts Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to standardize the underlying meaning of versions, but users could still confront abnormal execution and crash after upgrades even if compilation and linkage succeed. It is caused by semantic breaking (SemB) issues, such that APIs directly used by users have identical signatures but inconsistent semantics across upgrades. To strengthen compliance with SemVer rules, developers and users should be alerted of such issues. Unfortunately, it is challenging to detect them statically, because semantic changes in the internal methods of APIs are difficult to capture. Dynamic testing can confirmingly uncover some, but it is limited by inadequate coverage.   To detect SemB issues over compatible upgrades (Patch and Minor) by SemVer rules, we conduct an empirical study on 180 SemB issues to understand the root causes, inspired by which, we propose Sembid (Semantic Breaking Issue Detector) to statically detect such issues of TPLs for developers and users. Since APIs are directly used by users, Sembid detects and reports SemB issues based on APIs. For a pair of APIs, Sembid walks through the call chains originating from the API to locate breaking changes by measuring semantic diff. Then, Sembid checks if the breaking changes can affect API's output along call chains. The evaluation showed Sembid achieved 90.26% recall and 81.29% precision and outperformed other API checkers on SemB API detection. We also revealed Sembid detected over 3 times more SemB APIs with better coverage than unit tests, the commonly used solution. Furthermore, we carried out an empirical study on 1,629,589 APIs from 546 version pairs of top Java libraries and found there were 2-4 times more SemB APIs than those with signature-based issues.

> Unsupervised image transfer enables intra- and inter-modality image translation in applications where a large amount of paired training data is not abundant. To ensure a structure-preserving mapping from the input to the target domain, existing methods for unpaired image transfer are commonly based on cycle-consistency, causing additional computational resources and instability due to the learning of an inverse mapping. This paper presents a novel method for uni-directional domain mapping that does not rely on any paired training data. A proper transfer is achieved by using a GAN architecture and a novel generator loss based on patch invariance. To be more specific, the generator outputs are evaluated and compared at different scales, also leading to an increased focus on high-frequency details as well as an implicit data augmentation. This novel patch loss also offers the possibility to accurately predict aleatoric uncertainty by modeling an input-dependent scale map for the patch residuals. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on three well-established medical databases. As compared to four state-of-the-art methods, we observe significantly higher accuracy on these datasets, indicating great potential of the proposed method for unpaired image transfer with uncertainty taken into account. Implementation of the proposed framework is released here: \url{https://github.com/anger-man/unsupervised-image-transfer-and-uq}.

> We introduce a self-supervised vision representation model BEiT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers. Following BERT developed in the natural language processing area, we propose a masked image modeling task to pretrain vision Transformers. Specifically, each image has two views in our pre-training, i.e, image patches (such as 16x16 pixels), and visual tokens (i.e., discrete tokens). We first "tokenize" the original image into visual tokens. Then we randomly mask some image patches and fed them into the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the original visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training BEiT, we directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by appending task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves competitive results with previous pre-training methods. For example, base-size BEiT achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, significantly outperforming from-scratch DeiT training (81.8%) with the same setup. Moreover, large-size BEiT obtains 86.3% only using ImageNet-1K, even outperforming ViT-L with supervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K (85.2%). The code and pretrained models are available at https://aka.ms/beit.

> Several studies have shown that automated support for different activities of the security patch management process has great potential for reducing delays in installing security patches. However, it is also important to understand how automation is used in practice, its limitations in meeting real-world needs and what practitioners really need, an area that has not been empirically investigated in the existing software engineering literature. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at investigating different aspects of automation for security patch management using semi-structured interviews with 17 practitioners from three different organisations in the healthcare domain. The findings are focused on the role of automation in security patch management for providing insights into the as-is state of automation in practice, the limitations of current automation, how automation support can be enhanced to effectively meet practitioners' needs, and the role of the human in an automated process. Based on the findings, we have derived a set of recommendations for directing future efforts aimed at developing automated support for security patch management.

> Numerous security attacks that resulted in devastating consequences can be traced back to a delay in applying a security patch. Despite the criticality of timely patch application, not much is known about why and how delays occur when applying security patches in practice, and how the delays can be mitigated. Based on longitudinal data collected from 132 delayed patching tasks over a period of four years and observations of patch meetings involving eight teams from two organisations in the healthcare domain, and using quantitative and qualitative data analysis approaches, we identify a set of reasons relating to technology, people and organisation as key explanations that cause delays in patching. Our findings also reveal that the most prominent cause of delays is attributable to coordination delays in the patch management process and a majority of delays occur during the patch deployment phase. Towards mitigating the delays, we describe a set of strategies employed by the studied practitioners. This research serves as the first step towards understanding the practical reasons for delays and possible mitigation strategies in vulnerability patch management. Our findings provide useful insights for practitioners to understand what and where improvement is needed in the patch management process and guide them towards taking timely actions against potential attacks. Also, our findings help researchers to invest effort into designing and developing computer-supported tools to better support a timely security patch management process.

> Besides image classification, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has accomplished extraordinary success for a wide range of vision tasks, including object-level and 3D space understanding. However, it's still challenging to transfer semantic knowledge learned from CLIP into more intricate tasks of quantified targets, such as depth estimation with geometric information. In this paper, we propose to apply CLIP for zero-shot monocular depth estimation, named DepthCLIP. We found that the patches of the input image could respond to a certain semantic distance token and then be projected to a quantified depth bin for coarse estimation. Without any training, our DepthCLIP surpasses existing unsupervised methods and even approaches the early fully-supervised networks. To our best knowledge, we are the first to conduct zero-shot adaptation from the semantic language knowledge to quantified downstream tasks and perform zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We hope our work could cast a light on future research. The code is available at https://github.com/Adonis-galaxy/DepthCLIP.

- `2207.01795v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01795v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01795v3)

> Adversarial patch attacks mislead neural networks by injecting adversarial pixels within a local region. Patch attacks can be highly effective in a variety of tasks and physically realizable via attachment (e.g. a sticker) to the real-world objects. Despite the diversity in attack patterns, adversarial patches tend to be highly textured and different in appearance from natural images. We exploit this property and present PatchZero, a general defense pipeline against white-box adversarial patches without retraining the downstream classifier or detector. Specifically, our defense detects adversaries at the pixel-level and "zeros out" the patch region by repainting with mean pixel values. We further design a two-stage adversarial training scheme to defend against the stronger adaptive attacks. PatchZero achieves SOTA defense performance on the image classification (ImageNet, RESISC45), object detection (PASCAL VOC), and video classification (UCF101) tasks with little degradation in benign performance. In addition, PatchZero transfers to different patch shapes and attack types.

> Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary's elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.

> Transformers combined with convolutional encoders have been recently used for hand gesture recognition (HGR) using micro-Doppler signatures. We propose a vision-transformer-based architecture for HGR with multi-antenna continuous-wave Doppler radar receivers. The proposed architecture consists of three modules: a convolutional encoderdecoder, an attention module with three transformer layers, and a multi-layer perceptron. The novel convolutional decoder helps to feed patches with larger sizes to the attention module for improved feature extraction. Experimental results obtained with a dataset corresponding to a two-antenna continuous-wave Doppler radar receiver operating at 24 GHz (published by Skaria et al.) confirm that the proposed architecture achieves an accuracy of 98.3% which substantially surpasses the state-of-the-art on the used dataset.

> Vision transformers are emerging as a powerful tool to solve computer vision problems. Recent techniques have also proven the efficacy of transformers beyond the image domain to solve numerous video-related tasks. Among those, human action recognition is receiving special attention from the research community due to its widespread applications. This article provides the first comprehensive survey of vision transformer techniques for action recognition. We analyze and summarize the existing and emerging literature in this direction while highlighting the popular trends in adapting transformers for action recognition. Due to their specialized application, we collectively refer to these methods as ``action transformers''. Our literature review provides suitable taxonomies for action transformers based on their architecture, modality, and intended objective. Within the context of action transformers, we explore the techniques to encode spatio-temporal data, dimensionality reduction, frame patch and spatio-temporal cube construction, and various representation methods. We also investigate the optimization of spatio-temporal attention in transformer layers to handle longer sequences, typically by reducing the number of tokens in a single attention operation. Moreover, we also investigate different network learning strategies, such as self-supervised and zero-shot learning, along with their associated losses for transformer-based action recognition. This survey also summarizes the progress towards gaining grounds on evaluation metric scores on important benchmarks with action transformers. Finally, it provides a discussion on the challenges, outlook, and future avenues for this research direction.

> Sequential manipulation tasks require a robot to perceive the state of an environment and plan a sequence of actions leading to a desired goal state. In such tasks, the ability to reason about spatial relations among object entities from raw sensor inputs is crucial in order to determine when a task has been completed and which actions can be executed. In this work, we propose SORNet (Spatial Object-Centric Representation Network), a framework for learning object-centric representations from RGB images conditioned on a set of object queries, represented as image patches called canonical object views. With only a single canonical view per object and no annotation, SORNet generalizes zero-shot to object entities whose shape and texture are both unseen during training. We evaluate SORNet on various spatial reasoning tasks such as spatial relation classification and relative direction regression in complex tabletop manipulation scenarios and show that SORNet significantly outperforms baselines including state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. We also demonstrate the application of the representation learned by SORNet on visual-servoing and task planning for sequential manipulation on a real robot.

We compare several (non)-robust classifiers with different architectures and study their properties, including the effect of adversarial training on the interpretability of the learnt features and robustness to unseen threat models. An ablation from ResNet to ConvNeXt reveals key architectural changes leading to almost $10\%$ higher $\ell_\infty$-robustness.

> Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance and stronger adversarial robustness compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). On the one hand, ViTs' focus on global interaction between individual patches reduces the local noise sensitivity of images. On the other hand, the neglect of noise sensitivity differences between image regions by existing decision-based attacks further compromises the efficiency of noise compression, especially for ViTs. Therefore, validating the black-box adversarial robustness of ViTs when the target model can only be queried still remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the limitations of existing decision-based attacks from the perspective of noise sensitivity difference between regions of the image, and propose a new decision-based black-box attack against ViTs, termed Patch-wise Adversarial Removal (PAR). PAR divides images into patches through a coarse-to-fine search process and compresses the noise on each patch separately. PAR records the noise magnitude and noise sensitivity of each patch and selects the patch with the highest query value for noise compression. In addition, PAR can be used as a noise initialization method for other decision-based attacks to improve the noise compression efficiency on both ViTs and CNNs without introducing additional calculations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that PAR achieves a much lower noise magnitude with the same number of queries.

> Determining an appropriate number of attention heads on one hand and the number of transformer-encoders, on the other hand, is an important choice for Computer Vision (CV) tasks using the Transformer architecture. Computing experiments confirmed the expectation that the total number of parameters has to satisfy the condition of overdetermination (i.e., number of constraints significantly exceeding the number of parameters). Then, good generalization performance can be expected. This sets the boundaries within which the number of heads and the number of transformers can be chosen. If the role of context in images to be classified can be assumed to be small, it is favorable to use multiple transformers with a low number of heads (such as one or two). In classifying objects whose class may heavily depend on the context within the image (i.e., the meaning of a patch being dependent on other patches), the number of heads is equally important as that of transformers.

> This work presents Z-Mask, a robust and effective strategy to improve the adversarial robustness of convolutional networks against physically-realizable adversarial attacks. The presented defense relies on specific Z-score analysis performed on the internal network features to detect and mask the pixels corresponding to adversarial objects in the input image. To this end, spatially contiguous activations are examined in shallow and deep layers to suggest potential adversarial regions. Such proposals are then aggregated through a multi-thresholding mechanism. The effectiveness of Z-Mask is evaluated with an extensive set of experiments carried out on models for both semantic segmentation and object detection. The evaluation is performed with both digital patches added to the input images and printed patches positioned in the real world. The obtained results confirm that Z-Mask outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and overall performance of the networks under attack. Additional experiments showed that Z-Mask is also robust against possible defense-aware attacks.

> Color image denoising is frequently encountered in various image processing and computer vision tasks. One traditional strategy is to convert the RGB image to a less correlated color space and denoise each channel of the new space separately. However, such a strategy can not fully exploit the correlated information between channels and is inadequate to obtain satisfactory results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new multi-channel optimization model for color image denoising under the nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm minimization framework. Specifically, based on the block-matching, the color image is decomposed into overlapping RGB patches. For each patch, we stack its similar neighbors to form the corresponding patch matrix. The proposed model is performed on the patch matrix to recover its noise-free version. During the recovery process, a) a weight matrix is introduced to fully utilize the noise difference between channels; b) the singular values are shrunk adaptively without additionally assigning weights. With them, the proposed model can achieve promising results while keeping simplicity. To solve the proposed model, an accurate and effective algorithm is built based on the alternating direction method of multipliers framework. The solution of each updating step can be analytically expressed in closed-from. Rigorous theoretical analysis proves the solution sequences generated by the proposed algorithm converge to their respective stationary points. Experimental results on both synthetic and real noise datasets demonstrate the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

> Background: Testing and validation of the semantic correctness of patches provided by tools for Automated Program Repairs (APR) has received a lot of attention. Yet, the eventual acceptance or rejection of suggested patches for real world projects by humans patch reviewers has received a limited attention. Objective: To address this issue, we plan to investigate whether (possibly incorrect) security patches suggested by APR tools are recognized by human reviewers. We also want to investigate whether knowing that a patch was produced by an allegedly specialized tool does change the decision of human reviewers. Method: In the first phase, using a balanced design, we propose to human reviewers a combination of patches proposed by APR tools for different vulnerabilities and ask reviewers to adopt or reject the proposed patches. In the second phase, we tell participants that some of the proposed patches were generated by security specialized tools (even if the tool was actually a `normal' APR tool) and measure whether the human reviewers would change their decision to adopt or reject a patch. Limitations: The experiment will be conducted in an academic setting, and to maintain power, it will focus on a limited sample of popular APR tools and popular vulnerability types.

> IoT devices are present in many, especially corporate and sensitive, networks and regularly introduce security risks due to slow vendor responses to vulnerabilities and high difficulty of patching. In this paper, we want to evaluate to what extent the development of future risk of IoT devices due to new and unpatched vulnerabilities can be predicted based on historic information. For this analysis, we build on existing prediction algorithms available in the SAFER framework (prophet and ARIMA) which we evaluate by means of a large data-set of vulnerabilities and patches from 793 IoT devices. Our analysis shows that the SAFER framework can predict a correct future risk for 91% of the devices, demonstrating its applicability. We conclude that this approach is a reliable means for network operators to efficiently detect and act on risks emanating from IoT devices in their networks.

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) have proven to be effective, in solving 2D image understanding tasks by training over large-scale image datasets; and meanwhile as a somehow separate track, in modeling the 3D visual world too such as voxels or point clouds. However, with the growing hope that transformers can become the "universal" modeling tool for heterogeneous data, ViTs for 2D and 3D tasks have so far adopted vastly different architecture designs that are hardly transferable. That invites an (over-)ambitious question: can we close the gap between the 2D and 3D ViT architectures? As a piloting study, this paper demonstrates the appealing promise to understand the 3D visual world, using a standard 2D ViT architecture, with only minimal customization at the input and output levels without redesigning the pipeline. To build a 3D ViT from its 2D sibling, we "inflate" the patch embedding and token sequence, accompanied with new positional encoding mechanisms designed to match the 3D data geometry. The resultant "minimalist" 3D ViT, named Simple3D-Former, performs surprisingly robustly on popular 3D tasks such as object classification, point cloud segmentation and indoor scene detection, compared to highly customized 3D-specific designs. It can hence act as a strong baseline for new 3D ViTs. Moreover, we note that pursing a unified 2D-3D ViT design has practical relevance besides just scientific curiosity. Specifically, we demonstrate that Simple3D-Former naturally enables to exploit the wealth of pre-trained weights from large-scale realistic 2D images (e.g., ImageNet), which can be plugged in to enhancing the 3D task performance "for free".

- `2209.08569v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08569v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08569v1)

> Recent efforts of multimodal Transformers have improved Visually Rich Document Understanding (VrDU) tasks via incorporating visual and textual information. However, existing approaches mainly focus on fine-grained elements such as words and document image patches, making it hard for them to learn from coarse-grained elements, including natural lexical units like phrases and salient visual regions like prominent image regions. In this paper, we attach more importance to coarse-grained elements containing high-density information and consistent semantics, which are valuable for document understanding. At first, a document graph is proposed to model complex relationships among multi-grained multimodal elements, in which salient visual regions are detected by a cluster-based method. Then, a multi-grained multimodal Transformer called mmLayout is proposed to incorporate coarse-grained information into existing pre-trained fine-grained multimodal Transformers based on the graph. In mmLayout, coarse-grained information is aggregated from fine-grained, and then, after further processing, is fused back into fine-grained for final prediction. Furthermore, common sense enhancement is introduced to exploit the semantic information of natural lexical units. Experimental results on four tasks, including information extraction and document question answering, show that our method can improve the performance of multimodal Transformers based on fine-grained elements and achieve better performance with fewer parameters. Qualitative analyses show that our method can capture consistent semantics in coarse-grained elements.

> Android apps are event-driven, and their execution is often interrupted by external events. This interruption can cause data loss issues that annoy users. For instance, when the screen is rotated, the current app page will be destroyed and recreated. If the app state is improperly preserved, user data will be lost. In this work, we present an approach and tool iFixDataloss that automatically detects and fixes data loss issues in Android apps. To achieve this, we identify scenarios in which data loss issues may occur, develop strategies to reveal data loss issues, and design patch templates to fix them. Our experiments on 66 Android apps show iFixDataloss detected 374 data loss issues (284 of them were previously unknown) and successfully generated patches for 188 of the 374 issues. Out of 20 submitted patches, 16 have been accepted by developers. In comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, iFixDataloss performed significantly better in terms of the number of detected data loss issues and the quality of generated patches.

> In this paper, we study problems of connecting classes of points via noncrossing structures. Given a set of colored terminal points, we want to find a graph for each color that connects all terminals of its color with the restriction that no two graphs cross each other. We consider these problems both on the Euclidean plane and in planar graphs.   On the algorithmic side, we give a Gap-ETH-tight EPTAS for the two-colored traveling salesman problem as well as for the red-blue-green separation problem (in which we want to separate terminals of three colors with two noncrossing polygons of minimum length), both on the Euclidean plane. This improves the work of Arora and Chang (ICALP 2003) who gave a slower PTAS for the simpler red-blue separation problem. For the case of unweighted plane graphs, we also show a PTAS for the two-colored traveling salesman problem. All these results are based on our new patching procedure that might be of independent interest.   On the negative side, we show that the problem of connecting terminal pairs with noncrossing paths is NP-hard on the Euclidean plane, and that the problem of finding two noncrossing spanning trees is NP-hard in plane graphs.

> Data mixing augmentation have proved to be effective in improving the generalization ability of deep neural networks. While early methods mix samples by hand-crafted policies (e.g., linear interpolation), recent methods utilize saliency information to match the mixed samples and labels via complex offline optimization. However, there arises a trade-off between precise mixing policies and optimization complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel automatic mixup (AutoMix) framework, where the mixup policy is parameterized and serves the ultimate classification goal directly. Specifically, AutoMix reformulates the mixup classification into two sub-tasks (i.e., mixed sample generation and mixup classification) with corresponding sub-networks and solves them in a bi-level optimization framework. For the generation, a learnable lightweight mixup generator, Mix Block, is designed to generate mixed samples by modeling patch-wise relationships under the direct supervision of the corresponding mixed labels. To prevent the degradation and instability of bi-level optimization, we further introduce a momentum pipeline to train AutoMix in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on nine image benchmarks prove the superiority of AutoMix compared with state-of-the-art in various classification scenarios and downstream tasks.

> We study norm-based uniform convergence bounds for neural networks, aiming at a tight understanding of how these are affected by the architecture and type of norm constraint, for the simple class of scalar-valued one-hidden-layer networks, and inputs bounded in Euclidean norm. We begin by proving that in general, controlling the spectral norm of the hidden layer weight matrix is insufficient to get uniform convergence guarantees (independent of the network width), while a stronger Frobenius norm control is sufficient, extending and improving on previous work. Motivated by the proof constructions, we identify and analyze two important settings where (perhaps surprisingly) a mere spectral norm control turns out to be sufficient: First, when the network's activation functions are sufficiently smooth (with the result extending to deeper networks); and second, for certain types of convolutional networks. In the latter setting, we study how the sample complexity is additionally affected by parameters such as the amount of overlap between patches and the overall number of patches.

> Cold start is an essential and persistent problem in recommender systems. State-of-the-art solutions rely on training hybrid models for both cold-start and existing users/items, based on the auxiliary information. Such a hybrid model would compromise the performance of existing users/items, which might make these solutions not applicable in real-worlds recommender systems where the experience of existing users/items must be guaranteed. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to perform effectively warm (non-cold-start) recommendations. However, they have never been applied to handle the cold-start problem in a user-item bipartite graph. This is a challenging but rewarding task since cold-start users/items do not have links. Besides, it is nontrivial to design an appropriate GNN to conduct cold-start recommendations while maintaining the performance for existing users/items. To bridge the gap, we propose a tailored GNN-based framework (GPatch) that contains two separate but correlated components. First, an efficient GNN architecture -- GWarmer, is designed to model the warm users/items. Second, we construct correlated Patching Networks to simulate and patch GWarmer by conducting cold-start recommendations. Experiments on benchmark and large-scale commercial datasets demonstrate that GPatch is significantly superior in providing recommendations for both existing and cold-start users/items.

> Pathologists diagnose and grade prostate cancer by examining tissue from needle biopsies on glass slides. The cancer's severity and risk of metastasis are determined by the Gleason grade, a score based on the organization and morphology of prostate cancer glands. For diagnostic work-up, pathologists first locate glands in the whole biopsy core, and -- if they detect cancer -- they assign a Gleason grade. This time-consuming process is subject to errors and significant inter-observer variability, despite strict diagnostic criteria. This paper proposes an automated workflow that follows pathologists' \textit{modus operandi}, isolating and classifying multi-scale patches of individual glands in whole slide images (WSI) of biopsy tissues using distinct steps: (1) two fully convolutional networks segment epithelium versus stroma and gland boundaries, respectively; (2) a classifier network separates benign from cancer glands at high magnification; and (3) an additional classifier predicts the grade of each cancer gland at low magnification. Altogether, this process provides a gland-specific approach for prostate cancer grading that we compare against other machine-learning-based grading methods.

> Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification successively alternate convolutions and downsampling operations, such as pooling layers or strided convolutions, resulting in lower resolution features the deeper the network gets. These downsampling operations save computational resources and provide some translational invariance as well as a bigger receptive field at the next layers. However, an inherent side-effect of this is that high-level features, produced at the deep end of the network, are always captured in low resolution feature maps. The inverse is also true, as shallow layers always contain small scale features. In biomedical image analysis engineers are often tasked with classifying very small image patches which carry only a limited amount of information. By their nature, these patches may not even contain objects, with the classification depending instead on the detection of subtle underlying patterns with an unknown scale in the image's texture. In these cases every bit of information is valuable; thus, it is important to extract the maximum number of informative features possible. Driven by these considerations, we introduce a new CNN architecture which preserves multi-scale features from deep, intermediate, and shallow layers by utilizing skip connections along with consecutive contractions and expansions of the feature maps. Using a dataset of very low resolution patches from Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) CT scans we demonstrate that our network can outperform current state of the art models.

> Students often make mistakes on their introductory programming assignments as part of their learning process. Unfortunately, providing custom repairs for these mistakes can require a substantial amount of time and effort from class instructors. Automated program repair (APR) techniques can be used to synthesize such fixes. Prior work has explored the use of symbolic and neural techniques for APR in the education domain. Both types of approaches require either substantial engineering efforts or large amounts of data and training. We propose to use a large language model trained on code, such as Codex, to build an APR system -- MMAPR -- for introductory Python programming assignments. Our system can fix both syntactic and semantic mistakes by combining multi-modal prompts, iterative querying, test-case-based selection of few-shots, and program chunking. We evaluate MMAPR on 286 real student programs and compare to a baseline built by combining a state-of-the-art Python syntax repair engine, BIFI, and state-of-the-art Python semantic repair engine for student assignments, Refactory. We find that MMAPR can fix more programs and produce smaller patches on average.

> One-shot Network Pruning at Initialization (OPaI) is an effective method to decrease network pruning costs. Recently, there is a growing belief that data is unnecessary in OPaI. However, we obtain an opposite conclusion by ablation experiments in two representative OPaI methods, SNIP and GraSP. Specifically, we find that informative data is crucial to enhancing pruning performance. In this paper, we propose two novel methods, Discriminative One-shot Network Pruning (DOP) and Super Stitching, to prune the network by high-level visual discriminative image patches. Our contributions are as follows. (1) Extensive experiments reveal that OPaI is data-dependent. (2) Super Stitching performs significantly better than the original OPaI method on benchmark ImageNet, especially in a highly compressed model.

> Large-scale self-supervised pre-training Transformer architecture have significantly boosted the performance for various tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, there is a lack of researches on processing multivariate time-series by pre-trained Transformer, and especially, current study on masking time-series for self-supervised learning is still a gap. Different from language and image processing, the information density of time-series increases the difficulty of research. The challenge goes further with the invalidity of the previous patch embedding and mask methods. In this paper, according to the data characteristics of multivariate time-series, a patch embedding method is proposed, and we present an self-supervised pre-training approach based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), called MTSMAE, which can improve the performance significantly over supervised learning without pre-training. Evaluating our method on several common multivariate time-series datasets from different fields and with different characteristics, experiment results demonstrate that the performance of our method is significantly better than the best method currently available.

> Deep neural networks are known to be susceptible to adversarial perturbations -- small perturbations that alter the output of the network and exist under strict norm limitations. While such perturbations are usually discussed as tailored to a specific input, a universal perturbation can be constructed to alter the model's output on a set of inputs. Universal perturbations present a more realistic case of adversarial attacks, as awareness of the model's exact input is not required. In addition, the universal attack setting raises the subject of generalization to unseen data, where given a set of inputs, the universal perturbations aim to alter the model's output on out-of-sample data. In this work, we study physical passive patch adversarial attacks on visual odometry-based autonomous navigation systems. A visual odometry system aims to infer the relative camera motion between two corresponding viewpoints, and is frequently used by vision-based autonomous navigation systems to estimate their state. For such navigation systems, a patch adversarial perturbation poses a severe security issue, as it can be used to mislead a system onto some collision course. To the best of our knowledge, we show for the first time that the error margin of a visual odometry model can be significantly increased by deploying patch adversarial attacks in the scene. We provide evaluation on synthetic closed-loop drone navigation data and demonstrate that a comparable vulnerability exists in real data. A reference implementation of the proposed method and the reported experiments is provided at https://github.com/patchadversarialattacks/patchadversarialattacks.

> Due to their widespread use on heterogeneous hardware devices, deep learning (DL) models are compiled into executables by DL compilers to fully leverage low-level hardware primitives. This approach allows DL computations to be undertaken at low cost across a variety of computing platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and various hardware accelerators.   We present BTD (Bin to DNN), a decompiler for deep neural network (DNN) executables. BTD takes DNN executables and outputs full model specifications, including types of DNN operators, network topology, dimensions, and parameters that are (nearly) identical to those of the input models. BTD delivers a practical framework to process DNN executables compiled by different DL compilers and with full optimizations enabled on x86 platforms. It employs learning-based techniques to infer DNN operators, dynamic analysis to reveal network architectures, and symbolic execution to facilitate inferring dimensions and parameters of DNN operators.   Our evaluation reveals that BTD enables accurate recovery of full specifications of complex DNNs with millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet). The recovered DNN specifications can be re-compiled into a new DNN executable exhibiting identical behavior to the input executable. We show that BTD can boost two representative attacks, adversarial example generation and knowledge stealing, against DNN executables. We also demonstrate cross-architecture legacy code reuse using BTD, and envision BTD being used for other critical downstream tasks like DNN security hardening and patching.

> Vision transformers have demonstrated the potential to outperform CNNs in a variety of vision tasks. But the computational and memory requirements of these models prohibit their use in many applications, especially those that depend on high-resolution images, such as medical image classification. Efforts to train ViTs more efficiently are overly complicated, necessitating architectural changes or intricate training schemes. In this work, we show that standard ViT models can be efficiently trained at high resolution by randomly dropping input image patches. This simple approach, PatchDropout, reduces FLOPs and memory by at least 50% in standard natural image datasets such as ImageNet, and those savings only increase with image size. On CSAW, a high-resolution medical dataset, we observe a 5 times savings in computation and memory using PatchDropout, along with a boost in performance. For practitioners with a fixed computational or memory budget, PatchDropout makes it possible to choose image resolution, hyperparameters, or model size to get the most performance out of their model.

> Masked image modeling (MIM) revolutionizes self-supervised learning (SSL) for image pre-training. In contrast to previous dominating self-supervised methods, i.e., contrastive learning, MIM attains state-of-the-art performance by masking and reconstructing random patches of the input image. However, the associated security and privacy risks of this novel generative method are unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first security risk quantification of MIM through the lens of backdoor attacks. Different from previous work, we are the first to systematically threat modeling on SSL in every phase of the model supply chain, i.e., pre-training, release, and downstream phases. Our evaluation shows that models built with MIM are vulnerable to existing backdoor attacks in release and downstream phases and are compromised by our proposed method in pre-training phase. For instance, on CIFAR10, the attack success rate can reach 99.62%, 96.48%, and 98.89% in the downstream phase, release phase, and pre-training phase, respectively. We also take the first step to investigate the success factors of backdoor attacks in the pre-training phase and find the trigger number and trigger pattern play key roles in the success of backdoor attacks while trigger location has only tiny effects. In the end, our empirical study of the defense mechanisms across three detection-level on model supply chain phases indicates that different defenses are suitable for backdoor attacks in different phases. However, backdoor attacks in the release phase cannot be detected by all three detection-level methods, calling for more effective defenses in future research.

> Data hiding with deep neural networks (DNNs) has experienced impressive successes in recent years. A prevailing scheme is to train an autoencoder, consisting of an encoding network to embed (or transform) secret messages in (or into) a carrier, and a decoding network to extract the hidden messages. This scheme may suffer from several limitations regarding practicability, security, and embedding capacity. In this work, we describe a different computational framework to hide images in deep probabilistic models. Specifically, we use a DNN to model the probability density of cover images, and hide a secret image in one particular location of the learned distribution. As an instantiation, we adopt a SinGAN, a pyramid of generative adversarial networks (GANs), to learn the patch distribution of one cover image. We hide the secret image by fitting a deterministic mapping from a fixed set of noise maps (generated by an embedding key) to the secret image during patch distribution learning. The stego SinGAN, behaving as the original SinGAN, is publicly communicated; only the receiver with the embedding key is able to extract the secret image. We demonstrate the feasibility of our SinGAN approach in terms of extraction accuracy and model security. Moreover, we show the flexibility of the proposed method in terms of hiding multiple images for different receivers and obfuscating the secret image.

> Motion transfer aims to transfer the motion of a driving video to a source image. When there are considerable differences between object in the driving video and that in the source image, traditional single domain motion transfer approaches often produce notable artifacts; for example, the synthesized image may fail to preserve the human shape of the source image (cf . Fig. 1 (a)). To address this issue, in this work, we propose a Motion and Appearance Adaptation (MAA) approach for cross-domain motion transfer, in which we regularize the object in the synthesized image to capture the motion of the object in the driving frame, while still preserving the shape and appearance of the object in the source image. On one hand, considering the object shapes of the synthesized image and the driving frame might be different, we design a shape-invariant motion adaptation module that enforces the consistency of the angles of object parts in two images to capture the motion information. On the other hand, we introduce a structure-guided appearance consistency module designed to regularize the similarity between the corresponding patches of the synthesized image and the source image without affecting the learned motion in the synthesized image. Our proposed MAA model can be trained in an end-to-end manner with a cyclic reconstruction loss, and ultimately produces a satisfactory motion transfer result (cf . Fig. 1 (b)). We conduct extensive experiments on human dancing dataset Mixamo-Video to Fashion-Video and human face dataset Vox-Celeb to Cufs; on both of these, our MAA model outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

> Learning a many-body Hamiltonian from its dynamics is a fundamental problem in physics. In this work, we propose the first algorithm to achieve the Heisenberg limit for learning an interacting $N$-qubit local Hamiltonian. After a total evolution time of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the proposed algorithm can efficiently estimate any parameter in the $N$-qubit Hamiltonian to $\epsilon$-error with high probability. The proposed algorithm is robust against state preparation and measurement error, does not require eigenstates or thermal states, and only uses $\mathrm{polylog}(\epsilon^{-1})$ experiments. In contrast, the best previous algorithms, such as recent works using gradient-based optimization or polynomial interpolation, require a total evolution time of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ experiments. Our algorithm uses ideas from quantum simulation to decouple the unknown $N$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ into noninteracting patches, and learns $H$ using a quantum-enhanced divide-and-conquer approach. We prove a matching lower bound to establish the asymptotic optimality of our algorithm.

> Neural-network-based approaches recently emerged in the field of data compression and have already led to significant progress in image compression, especially in achieving a higher compression ratio. In the lossless image compression scenario, however, existing methods often struggle to learn a probability model of full-size high-resolution images due to the limitation of the computation source. The current strategy is to crop high-resolution images into multiple non-overlapping patches and process them independently. This strategy ignores long-term dependencies beyond patches, thus limiting modeling performance. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical latent variable model with a global context to capture the long-term dependencies of high-resolution images. Besides the latent variable unique to each patch, we introduce shared latent variables between patches to construct the global context. The shared latent variables are extracted by a self-supervised clustering module inside the model's encoder. This clustering module assigns each patch the confidence that it belongs to any cluster. Later, shared latent variables are learned according to latent variables of patches and their confidence, which reflects the similarity of patches in the same cluster and benefits the global context modeling. Experimental results show that our global context model improves compression ratio compared to the engineered codecs and deep learning models on three benchmark high-resolution image datasets, DIV2K, CLIC.pro, and CLIC.mobile.

> Neural network weights are typically initialized at random from univariate distributions, controlling just the variance of individual weights even in highly-structured operations like convolutions. Recent ViT-inspired convolutional networks such as ConvMixer and ConvNeXt use large-kernel depthwise convolutions whose learned filters have notable structure; this presents an opportunity to study their empirical covariances. In this work, we first observe that such learned filters have highly-structured covariance matrices, and moreover, we find that covariances calculated from small networks may be used to effectively initialize a variety of larger networks of different depths, widths, patch sizes, and kernel sizes, indicating a degree of model-independence to the covariance structure. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a learning-free multivariate initialization scheme for convolutional filters using a simple, closed-form construction of their covariance. Models using our initialization outperform those using traditional univariate initializations, and typically meet or exceed the performance of those initialized from the covariances of learned filters; in some cases, this improvement can be achieved without training the depthwise convolutional filters at all.

> There is an ever-growing zoo of modern neural network models that can efficiently learn end-to-end control from visual observations. These advanced deep models, ranging from convolutional to patch-based networks, have been extensively tested on offline image classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we study these vision architectures with respect to the open-loop to closed-loop causality gap, i.e., offline training followed by an online closed-loop deployment. This causality gap typically emerges in robotics applications such as autonomous driving, where a network is trained to imitate the control commands of a human. In this setting, two situations arise: 1) Closed-loop testing in-distribution, where the test environment shares properties with those of offline training data. 2) Closed-loop testing under distribution shifts and out-of-distribution. Contrary to recently reported results, we show that under proper training guidelines, all vision models perform indistinguishably well on in-distribution deployment, resolving the causality gap. In situation 2, We observe that the causality gap disrupts performance regardless of the choice of the model architecture. Our results imply that the causality gap can be solved in situation one with our proposed training guideline with any modern network architecture, whereas achieving out-of-distribution generalization (situation two) requires further investigations, for instance, on data diversity rather than the model architecture.

> Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping is a parametric imaging technique to estimate the magnetic susceptibilities of biological tissues from MRI phase measurements. This problem of estimating the susceptibility map is ill posed. Regularized recovery approaches exploiting signal properties such as smoothness and sparsity improve reconstructions, but suffer from over-smoothing artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential and generate maps with reduced artifacts. However, for reasonable reconstructions and network generalization, they require numerous training datasets resulting in increased data acquisition time. To overcome this issue, we proposed a subject-specific, patch-based, unsupervised learning algorithm to estimate the susceptibility map. We make the problem well-posed by exploiting the redundancies across the patches of the map using a deep convolutional neural network. We formulated the recovery of the susceptibility map as a regularized optimization problem and adopted an alternating minimization strategy to solve it. We tested the algorithm on a 3D invivo dataset and, qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrated improved reconstructions over competing methods.

> Ovarian cancer is one of the most serious cancers that threaten women around the world. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), as the most commonly seen subtype of ovarian cancer, has rather high mortality rate and poor prognosis among various gynecological cancers. Survival analysis outcome is able to provide treatment advices to doctors. In recent years, with the development of medical imaging technology, survival prediction approaches based on pathological images have been proposed. In this study, we designed a deep framework named EOCSA which analyzes the prognosis of EOC patients based on pathological whole slide images (WSIs). Specifically, we first randomly extracted patches from WSIs and grouped them into multiple clusters. Next, we developed a survival prediction model, named DeepConvAttentionSurv (DCAS), which was able to extract patch-level features, removed less discriminative clusters and predicted the EOC survival precisely. Particularly, channel attention, spatial attention, and neuron attention mechanisms were used to improve the performance of feature extraction. Then patient-level features were generated from our weight calculation method and the survival time was finally estimated using LASSO-Cox model. The proposed EOCSA is efficient and effective in predicting prognosis of EOC and the DCAS ensures more informative and discriminative features can be extracted. As far as we know, our work is the first to analyze the survival of EOC based on WSIs and deep neural network technologies. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework has achieved state-of-the-art performance of 0.980 C-index. The implementation of the approach can be found at https://github.com/RanSuLab/EOCprognosis.

> Open-vocabulary models like CLIP achieve high accuracy across many image classification tasks. However, there are still settings where their zero-shot performance is far from optimal. We study model patching, where the goal is to improve accuracy on specific tasks without degrading accuracy on tasks where performance is already adequate. Towards this goal, we introduce PAINT, a patching method that uses interpolations between the weights of a model before fine-tuning and the weights after fine-tuning on a task to be patched. On nine tasks where zero-shot CLIP performs poorly, PAINT increases accuracy by 15 to 60 percentage points while preserving accuracy on ImageNet within one percentage point of the zero-shot model. PAINT also allows a single model to be patched on multiple tasks and improves with model scale. Furthermore, we identify cases of broad transfer, where patching on one task increases accuracy on other tasks even when the tasks have disjoint classes. Finally, we investigate applications beyond common benchmarks such as counting or reducing the impact of typographic attacks on CLIP. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to expand the set of tasks on which open-vocabulary models achieve high accuracy without re-training them from scratch.

> Artificial learning systems aspire to mimic human intelligence by continually learning from a stream of tasks without forgetting past knowledge. One way to enable such learning is to store past experiences in the form of input examples in episodic memory and replay them when learning new tasks. However, performance of such method suffers as the size of the memory becomes smaller. In this paper, we propose a new approach for experience replay, where we select the past experiences by looking at the saliency maps which provide visual explanations for the model's decision. Guided by these saliency maps, we pack the memory with only the parts or patches of the input images important for the model's prediction. While learning a new task, we replay these memory patches with appropriate zero-padding to remind the model about its past decisions. We evaluate our algorithm on CIFAR-100, miniImageNet and CUB datasets and report better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches. With qualitative and quantitative analyses we show that our method captures richer summaries of past experiences without any memory increase, and hence performs well with small episodic memory.

> In a backdoor attack, an attacker injects corrupted examples into the training set. The goal of the attacker is to cause the final trained model to predict the attacker's desired target label when a predefined trigger is added to test inputs. Central to these attacks is the trade-off between the success rate of the attack and the number of corrupted training examples injected. We pose this attack as a novel bilevel optimization problem: construct strong poison examples that maximize the attack success rate of the trained model. We use neural tangent kernels to approximate the training dynamics of the model being attacked and automatically learn strong poison examples. We experiment on subclasses of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with WideResNet-34 and ConvNeXt architectures on periodic and patch trigger attacks and show that NTBA-designed poisoned examples achieve, for example, an attack success rate of 90% with ten times smaller number of poison examples injected compared to the baseline. We provided an interpretation of the NTBA-designed attacks using the analysis of kernel linear regression. We further demonstrate a vulnerability in overparametrized deep neural networks, which is revealed by the shape of the neural tangent kernel.

> Unsupervised anomaly detection models which are trained solely by healthy data, have gained importance in the recent years, as the annotation of medical data is a tedious task. Autoencoders and generative adversarial networks are the standard anomaly detection methods that are utilized to learn the data distribution. However, they fall short when it comes to inference and evaluation of the likelihood of test samples. We propose a novel combination of generative models and a probabilistic graphical model. After encoding image samples by autoencoders, the distribution of data is modeled by Random and Tensorized Sum-Product Networks ensuring exact and efficient inference at test time. We evaluate different autoencoder architectures in combination with Random and Tensorized Sum-Product Networks on mammography images using patch-wise processing and observe superior performance over utilizing the models standalone and state-of-the-art in anomaly detection for medical data.

> Video language pre-training methods have mainly adopted sparse sampling techniques to alleviate the temporal redundancy of videos. Though effective, sparse sampling still suffers inter-modal redundancy: visual redundancy and textual redundancy. Compared with highly generalized text, sparsely sampled frames usually contain text-independent portions, called visual redundancy. Sparse sampling is also likely to miss important frames corresponding to some text portions, resulting in textual redundancy. Inter-modal redundancy leads to a mismatch of video and text information, hindering the model from better learning the shared semantics across modalities. To alleviate it, we propose Redundancy-aware Video-language Pre-training. We design a redundancy measurement of video patches and text tokens by calculating the cross-modal minimum dis-similarity. Then, we penalize the highredundant video patches and text tokens through a proposed redundancy-aware contrastive learning. We evaluate our method on four benchmark datasets, MSRVTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and LSMDC, achieving a significant improvement over the previous stateof-the-art results.

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) enabled the use of the transformer architecture on vision tasks showing impressive performances when trained on big datasets. However, on relatively small datasets, ViTs are less accurate given their lack of inductive bias. To this end, we propose a simple but still effective Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) strategy to train ViTs, that without any external annotation or external data, can significantly improve the results. Specifically, we define a set of SSL tasks based on relations of image patches that the model has to solve before or jointly the supervised task. Differently from ViT, our RelViT model optimizes all the output tokens of the transformer encoder that are related to the image patches, thus exploiting more training signals at each training step. We investigated our methods on several image benchmarks finding that RelViT improves the SSL state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, especially on small datasets.

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved comparable or superior performance than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. This empirical breakthrough is even more remarkable since, in contrast to CNNs, ViTs do not embed any visual inductive bias of spatial locality. Yet, recent works have shown that while minimizing their training loss, ViTs specifically learn spatially localized patterns. This raises a central question: how do ViTs learn these patterns by solely minimizing their training loss using gradient-based methods from random initialization? In this paper, we provide some theoretical justification of this phenomenon. We propose a spatially structured dataset and a simplified ViT model. In this model, the attention matrix solely depends on the positional encodings. We call this mechanism the positional attention mechanism. On the theoretical side, we consider a binary classification task and show that while the learning problem admits multiple solutions that generalize, our model implicitly learns the spatial structure of the dataset while generalizing: we call this phenomenon patch association. We prove that patch association helps to sample-efficiently transfer to downstream datasets that share the same structure as the pre-training one but differ in the features. Lastly, we empirically verify that a ViT with positional attention performs similarly to the original one on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN and ImageNet.

> Visual data such as images and videos are typically modeled as discretizations of inherently continuous, multidimensional signals. Existing continuous-signal models attempt to exploit this fact by modeling the underlying signals of visual (e.g., image) data directly. However, these models have not yet been able to achieve competitive performance on practical vision tasks such as large-scale image and video classification. Building on a recent line of work on deep state space models (SSMs), we propose S4ND, a new multidimensional SSM layer that extends the continuous-signal modeling ability of SSMs to multidimensional data including images and videos. We show that S4ND can model large-scale visual data in $1$D, $2$D, and $3$D as continuous multidimensional signals and demonstrates strong performance by simply swapping Conv2D and self-attention layers with S4ND layers in existing state-of-the-art models. On ImageNet-1k, S4ND exceeds the performance of a Vision Transformer baseline by $1.5\%$ when training with a $1$D sequence of patches, and matches ConvNeXt when modeling images in $2$D. For videos, S4ND improves on an inflated $3$D ConvNeXt in activity classification on HMDB-51 by $4\%$. S4ND implicitly learns global, continuous convolutional kernels that are resolution invariant by construction, providing an inductive bias that enables generalization across multiple resolutions. By developing a simple bandlimiting modification to S4 to overcome aliasing, S4ND achieves strong zero-shot (unseen at training time) resolution performance, outperforming a baseline Conv2D by $40\%$ on CIFAR-10 when trained on $8 \times 8$ and tested on $32 \times 32$ images. When trained with progressive resizing, S4ND comes within $\sim 1\%$ of a high-resolution model while training $22\%$ faster.

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved competitive performance in broad vision tasks. Unfortunately, on popular threat models, naturally trained ViTs are shown to provide no more adversarial robustness than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Adversarial training is still required for ViTs to defend against such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we provide the first and comprehensive study on the adversarial training recipe of ViTs via extensive evaluation of various training techniques across benchmark datasets. We find that pre-training and SGD optimizer are necessary for ViTs' adversarial training. Further considering ViT as a new type of model architecture, we investigate its adversarial robustness from the perspective of its unique architectural components. We find, when randomly masking gradients from some attention blocks or masking perturbations on some patches during adversarial training, the adversarial robustness of ViTs can be remarkably improved, which may potentially open up a line of work to explore the architectural information inside the newly designed models like ViTs.

> We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks. Code and pre-trained models have been made publicly available at https://github.com/LayneH/GreenMIM.

> Recently vision transformers (ViT) have been applied successfully for various tasks in computer vision. However, important questions such as why they work or how they behave still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we propose an effective visualization technique, to assist us in exposing the information carried in neurons and feature embeddings across the ViT's layers. Our approach departs from the computational process of ViTs with a focus on visualizing the local and global information in input images and the latent feature embeddings at multiple levels. Visualizations at the input and embeddings at level 0 reveal interesting findings such as providing support as to why ViTs are rather generally robust to image occlusions and patch shuffling; or unlike CNNs, level 0 embeddings already carry rich semantic details. Next, we develop a rigorous framework to perform effective visualizations across layers, exposing the effects of ViTs filters and grouping/clustering behaviors to object patches. Finally, we provide comprehensive experiments on real datasets to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the merit of our proposed methods as well as our findings. https://github.com/byM1902/ViT_visualization

> Vision Transformers achieved outstanding performance in many computer vision tasks. Early Vision Transformers such as ViT and DeiT adopt global self-attention, which is computationally expensive when the number of patches is large. To improve efficiency, recent Vision Transformers adopt local self-attention mechanisms, where self-attention is computed within local windows. Despite the fact that window-based local self-attention significantly boosts efficiency, it fails to capture the relationships between distant but similar patches in the image plane. To overcome this limitation of image-space local attention, in this paper, we further exploit the locality of patches in the feature space. We group the patches into multiple clusters using their features, and self-attention is computed within every cluster. Such feature-space local attention effectively captures the connections between patches across different local windows but still relevant. We propose a Bilateral lOcal Attention vision Transformer (BOAT), which integrates feature-space local attention with image-space local attention. We further integrate BOAT with both Swin and CSWin models, and extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our BOAT-CSWin model clearly and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art CNN models and vision Transformers.

> Image guided depth completion aims to recover per-pixel dense depth maps from sparse depth measurements with the help of aligned color images, which has a wide range of applications from robotics to autonomous driving. However, the 3D nature of sparse-to-dense depth completion has not been fully explored by previous methods. In this work, we propose a Graph Convolution based Spatial Propagation Network (GraphCSPN) as a general approach for depth completion. First, unlike previous methods, we leverage convolution neural networks as well as graph neural networks in a complementary way for geometric representation learning. In addition, the proposed networks explicitly incorporate learnable geometric constraints to regularize the propagation process performed in three-dimensional space rather than in two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, we construct the graph utilizing sequences of feature patches, and update it dynamically with an edge attention module during propagation, so as to better capture both the local neighboring features and global relationships over long distance. Extensive experiments on both indoor NYU-Depth-v2 and outdoor KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance, especially when compared in the case of using only a few propagation steps. Code and models are available at the project page.

> The segmentation of histopathological whole slide images into tumourous and non-tumourous types of tissue is a challenging task that requires the consideration of both local and global spatial contexts to classify tumourous regions precisely. The identification of subtypes of tumour tissue complicates the issue as the sharpness of separation decreases and the pathologist's reasoning is even more guided by spatial context. However, the identification of detailed types of tissue is crucial for providing personalized cancer therapies. Due to the high resolution of whole slide images, existing semantic segmentation methods, restricted to isolated image sections, are incapable of processing context information beyond. To take a step towards better context comprehension, we propose a patch neighbour attention mechanism to query the neighbouring tissue context from a patch embedding memory bank and infuse context embeddings into bottleneck hidden feature maps. Our memory attention framework (MAF) mimics a pathologist's annotation procedure -- zooming out and considering surrounding tissue context. The framework can be integrated into any encoder-decoder segmentation method. We evaluate the MAF on a public breast cancer and an internal kidney cancer data set using famous segmentation models (U-Net, DeeplabV3) and demonstrate the superiority over other context-integrating algorithms -- achieving a substantial improvement of up to $17\%$ on Dice score.

> This paper studies a conceptually simple extension of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to spatiotemporal representation learning from videos. We randomly mask out spacetime patches in videos and learn an autoencoder to reconstruct them in pixels. Interestingly, we show that our MAE method can learn strong representations with almost no inductive bias on spacetime (only except for patch and positional embeddings), and spacetime-agnostic random masking performs the best. We observe that the optimal masking ratio is as high as 90% (vs. 75% on images), supporting the hypothesis that this ratio is related to information redundancy of the data. A high masking ratio leads to a large speedup, e.g., > 4x in wall-clock time or even more. We report competitive results on several challenging video datasets using vanilla Vision Transformers. We observe that MAE can outperform supervised pre-training by large margins. We further report encouraging results of training on real-world, uncurated Instagram data. Our study suggests that the general framework of masked autoencoding (BERT, MAE, etc.) can be a unified methodology for representation learning with minimal domain knowledge.

We propose a number of improvements that make transformers outperform the state of the art for the first time. (1) We show that a hybrid architecture is more effective than plain transformers, by a large margin. (2) We introduce two branches collecting global (classification token) and local (patch tokens) information, from which we form a global image representation. (3) In each branch, we collect multi-layer features from the transformer encoder, corresponding to skip connections across distant layers. (4) We enhance locality of interactions at the deeper layers of the encoder, which is the relative weakness of vision transformers. We train our model on all commonly used training sets and, for the first time, we make fair comparisons separately per training set. In all cases, we outperform previous models based on global representation. Public code is available at https://github.com/dealicious-inc/DToP.

> A framework is proposed for the unconditional generation of synthetic time series based on learning from a single sample in low-data regime case. The framework aims at capturing the distribution of patches in wavelet scalogram of time series using single image generative models and producing realistic wavelet coefficients for the generation of synthetic time series. It is demonstrated that the framework is effective with respect to fidelity and diversity for time series with insignificant to no trends. Also, the performance is more promising for generating samples with the same duration (reshuffling) rather than longer ones (retargeting).

> Multimodal learning considers learning from multi-modality data, aiming to fuse heterogeneous sources of information. However, it is not always feasible to leverage all available modalities due to memory constraints. Further, training on all the modalities may be inefficient when redundant information exists within data, such as different subsets of modalities providing similar performance. In light of these challenges, we study modality selection, intending to efficiently select the most informative and complementary modalities under certain computational constraints. We formulate a theoretical framework for optimizing modality selection in multimodal learning and introduce a utility measure to quantify the benefit of selecting a modality. For this optimization problem, we present efficient algorithms when the utility measure exhibits monotonicity and approximate submodularity. We also connect the utility measure with existing Shapley-value-based feature importance scores. Last, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on synthetic (Patch-MNIST) and two real-world (PEMS-SF, CMU-MOSI) datasets.

> Multi-organ segmentation enables organ evaluation, accounts the relationship between multiple organs, and facilitates accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions. However, only few models can perform segmentation accurately because of the lack of datasets and computational resources. On AMOS2022 challenge, which is a large-scale, clinical, and diverse abdominal multiorgan segmentation benchmark, we trained a 3D-UNet model with large batch and patch sizes using multi-GPU distributed training. Segmentation performance tended to increase for models with large batch and patch sizes compared with the baseline settings. The accuracy was further improved by using ensemble models that were trained with different settings. These results provide a reference for parameter selection in organ segmentation.

> With the recent successful adaptation of transformers to the vision domain, particularly when trained in a self-supervised fashion, it has been shown that vision transformers can learn impressive object-reasoning-like behaviour and features expressive for the task of object segmentation in images. In this paper, we build on the self-supervision task of masked autoencoding and explore its effectiveness for explicitly learning object-centric representations with transformers. To this end, we design an object-centric autoencoder using transformers only and train it end-to-end to reconstruct full images from unmasked patches. We show that the model efficiently learns to decompose simple scenes as measured by segmentation metrics on several multi-object benchmarks.

> Inspired by the success of self-supervised autoregressive representation learning in natural language (GPT and its variants), and advances in recent visual architecture design with Vision Transformers (ViTs), in this paper, we explore the effect various design choices have on the success of applying such training strategies for visual feature learning. Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy that we call Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC). In RandSAC, we group patch representations (image tokens) into hierarchically arranged segments; within each segment, tokens are predicted in parallel, similar to BERT, while across segment predictions are sequential, similar to GPT. We illustrate that randomized serialization of the segments significantly improves the performance and results in distribution over spatially-long (across-segments) and -short (within-segment) predictions which are effective for feature learning. We illustrate the pertinence of these design choices and explore alternatives on a number of datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet). While our pre-training strategy works with a vanilla Transformer, we also propose a conceptually simple, but highly effective, addition to the decoder that allows learnable skip-connections to encoder$'$s feature layers, which further improves the performance.

> Image anomaly detection consists in detecting images or image portions that are visually different from the majority of the samples in a dataset. The task is of practical importance for various real-life applications like biomedical image analysis, visual inspection in industrial production, banking, traffic management, etc. Most of the current deep learning approaches rely on image reconstruction: the input image is projected in some latent space and then reconstructed, assuming that the network (mostly trained on normal data) will not be able to reconstruct the anomalous portions. However, this assumption does not always hold. We thus propose a new model based on the Vision Transformer architecture with patch masking: the input image is split in several patches, and each patch is reconstructed only from the surrounding data, thus ignoring the potentially anomalous information contained in the patch itself. We then show that multi-resolution patches and their collective embeddings provide a large improvement in the model's performance compared to the exclusive use of the traditional square patches. The proposed model has been tested on popular anomaly detection datasets such as MVTec and head CT and achieved good results when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

> Background: Beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain are the defining 'A' and 'T' hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and together with structural atrophy detectable on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as one of the neurodegenerative ('N') biomarkers comprise the ''ATN framework'' of AD. Current methods to detect A$\beta$/tau pathology include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; invasive), positron emission tomography (PET; costly and not widely available), and blood-based biomarkers (BBBM; promising but mainly still in development).   Objective: To develop a non-invasive and widely available structural MRI-based framework to quantitatively predict the amyloid and tau measurements.   Methods: With MRI-based hippocampal multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) features, we apply our Patch Analysis-based Surface Correntropy-induced Sparse coding and max-pooling (PASCS-MP) method combined with the ridge regression model to individual amyloid/tau measure prediction.   Results: We evaluate our framework on amyloid PET/MRI and tau PET/MRI datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Each subject has one pair consisting of a PET image and MRI scan, collected at about the same time. Experimental results suggest that amyloid/tau measurements predicted with our PASCP-MP representations are closer to the real values than the measures derived from other approaches, such as hippocampal surface area, volume, and shape morphometry features based on spherical harmonics (SPHARM).   Conclusion: The MMS-based PASCP-MP is an efficient tool that can bridge hippocampal atrophy with amyloid and tau pathology and thus help assess disease burden, progression, and treatment effects.

> Recently, vision transformer (ViT) has started to outpace the conventional CNN in computer vision tasks. Considering privacy-preserving distributed learning with ViT, federated learning (FL) communicates models, which becomes ill-suited due to ViT' s large model size and computing costs. Split learning (SL) detours this by communicating smashed data at a cut-layer, yet suffers from data privacy leakage and large communication costs caused by high similarity between ViT' s smashed data and input data. Motivated by this problem, we propose DP-CutMixSL, a differentially private (DP) SL framework by developing DP patch-level randomized CutMix (DP-CutMix), a novel privacy-preserving inter-client interpolation scheme that replaces randomly selected patches in smashed data. By experiment, we show that DP-CutMixSL not only boosts privacy guarantees and communication efficiency, but also achieves higher accuracy than its Vanilla SL counterpart. Theoretically, we analyze that DP-CutMix amplifies R\'enyi DP (RDP), which is upper-bounded by its Vanilla Mixup counterpart.

> Self-supervised pre-training models have been used successfully in several machine learning domains. However, only a tiny amount of work is related to music. In our work, we treat a spectrogram of music as a series of patches and design a self-supervised model that captures the features of these sequential patches: Patchifier, which makes good use of self-supervised learning methods from both NLP and CV domains. We do not use labeled data for the pre-training process, only a subset of the MTAT dataset containing 16k music clips. After pre-training, we apply the model to several downstream tasks. Our model achieves a considerably acceptable result compared to other audio representation models. Meanwhile, our work demonstrates that it makes sense to consider audio as a series of patch segments.

> In this paper, we propose a multimodal transformer using parallel concatenated architecture. Instead of using patches, we use column stripes for images in R, G, B channels as the transformer input. The column stripes keep the spatial relations of original image. We incorporate the multimodal transformer with variational autoencoder for synthetic cross-modal data generation. The multimodal transformer is designed using multiple compression matrices, and it serves as encoders for Parallel Concatenated Variational AutoEncoders (PC-VAE). The PC-VAE consists of multiple encoders, one latent space, and two decoders. The encoders are based on random Gaussian matrices and don't need any training. We propose a new loss function based on the interaction information from partial information decomposition. The interaction information evaluates the input cross-modal information and decoder output. The PC-VAE are trained via minimizing the loss function. Experiments are performed to validate the proposed multimodal transformer for PC-VAE.

> Automated region of interest detection in histopathological image analysis is a challenging and important topic with tremendous potential impact on clinical practice. The deep-learning methods used in computational pathology help us to reduce costs and increase the speed and accuracy of regions of interest detection and cancer diagnosis. In this work, we propose a patch-based region of interest detection method for melanocytic skin tumor whole-slide images. We work with a dataset that contains 165 primary melanomas and nevi Hematoxylin and Eosin whole-slide images and build a deep-learning method. The proposed method performs well on a hold-out test data set including five TCGA-SKCM slides (accuracy of 93.94\% in slide classification task and intersection over union rate of 41.27\% in the region of interest detection task), showing the outstanding performance of our model on melanocytic skin tumor. Even though we test the experiments on the skin tumor dataset, our work could also be extended to other medical image detection problems, such as various tumors' classification and prediction, to help and benefit the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of different tumors.

> We introduce CAN, a simple, efficient and scalable method for self-supervised learning of visual representations. Our framework is a minimal and conceptually clean synthesis of (C) contrastive learning, (A) masked autoencoders, and (N) the noise prediction approach used in diffusion models. The learning mechanisms are complementary to one another: contrastive learning shapes the embedding space across a batch of image samples; masked autoencoders focus on reconstruction of the low-frequency spatial correlations in a single image sample; and noise prediction encourages the reconstruction of the high-frequency components of an image. The combined approach results in a robust, scalable and simple-to-implement algorithm. The training process is symmetric, with 50% of patches in both views being masked at random, yielding a considerable efficiency improvement over prior contrastive learning methods. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that CAN achieves strong downstream performance under both linear and finetuning evaluations on transfer learning and robustness tasks. CAN outperforms MAE and SimCLR when pre-training on ImageNet, but is especially useful for pre-training on larger uncurated datasets such as JFT-300M: for linear probe on ImageNet, CAN achieves 75.4% compared to 73.4% for SimCLR and 64.1% for MAE. The finetuned performance on ImageNet of our ViT-L model is 86.1%, compared to 85.5% for SimCLR, and 85.4% for MAE. The overall FLOPs load of SimCLR is 70% higher than CAN for ViT-L models.

> Fine-tuning pretrained language models (LMs) without making any architectural changes has become a norm for learning various language downstream tasks. However, for non-language downstream tasks, a common practice is to employ task-specific designs for input, output layers, and loss functions. For instance, it is possible to fine-tune an LM into an MNIST classifier by replacing the word embedding layer with an image patch embedding layer, the word token output layer with a 10-way output layer, and the word prediction loss with a 10-way classification loss, respectively. A natural question arises: Can LM fine-tuning solve non-language downstream tasks without changing the model architecture or loss function? To answer this, we propose Language-Interfaced Fine-Tuning (LIFT) and study its efficacy and limitations by conducting an extensive empirical study on a suite of non-language classification and regression tasks. LIFT does not make any changes to the model architecture or loss function, and it solely relies on the natural language interface, enabling "no-code machine learning with LMs." We find that LIFT performs comparably well across a wide range of low-dimensional classification and regression tasks, matching the performances of the best baselines in many cases, especially for the classification tasks. We also report experimental results on the fundamental properties of LIFT, including inductive bias, robustness, and sample complexity. We also analyze the effect of pretraining on LIFT and a few properties/techniques specific to LIFT, e.g., context-aware learning via appropriate prompting, calibrated predictions, data generation, and two-stage fine-tuning.

> Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a widely employed framework for learning on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) from WSI-level annotations. In most MIL based analytical pipelines for WSI-level analysis, the WSIs are often divided into patches and deep features for patches (i.e., patch embeddings) are extracted prior to training to reduce the overall computational cost and cope with the GPUs' limited RAM. To overcome this limitation, we present EmbAugmenter, a data augmentation generative adversarial network (DA-GAN) that can synthesize data augmentations in the embedding space rather than in the pixel space, thereby significantly reducing the computational requirements. Experiments on the SICAPv2 dataset show that our approach outperforms MIL without augmentation and is on par with traditional patch-level augmentation for MIL training while being substantially faster.

> Accurate intraoperative diagnosis is essential for providing safe and effective care during brain tumor surgery. Our standard-of-care diagnostic methods are time, resource, and labor intensive, which restricts access to optimal surgical treatments. To address these limitations, we propose an alternative workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH), a rapid optical imaging method, with deep learning-based automated interpretation of SRH images for intraoperative brain tumor diagnosis and real-time surgical decision support. Here, we present OpenSRH, the first public dataset of clinical SRH images from 300+ brain tumors patients and 1300+ unique whole slide optical images. OpenSRH contains data from the most common brain tumors diagnoses, full pathologic annotations, whole slide tumor segmentations, raw and processed optical imaging data for end-to-end model development and validation. We provide a framework for patch-based whole slide SRH classification and inference using weak (i.e. patient-level) diagnostic labels. Finally, we benchmark two computer vision tasks: multiclass histologic brain tumor classification and patch-based contrastive representation learning. We hope OpenSRH will facilitate the clinical translation of rapid optical imaging and real-time ML-based surgical decision support in order to improve the access, safety, and efficacy of cancer surgery in the era of precision medicine.

TVLT is trained by reconstructing masked patches of continuous video frames and audio spectrograms (masked autoencoding) and contrastive modeling to align video and audio. TVLT attains performance comparable to its text-based counterpart on various multimodal tasks, such as visual question answering, image retrieval, video retrieval, and multimodal sentiment analysis, with 28x faster inference speed and only 1/3 of the parameters. Our findings suggest the possibility of learning compact and efficient visual-linguistic representations from low-level visual and audio signals without assuming the prior existence of text.

> Network systems often contain vulnerabilities that remain unfixed in a network for various reasons, such as the lack of a patch or knowledge to fix them. With the presence of such residual vulnerabilities, the network administrator should properly react to the malicious activities or proactively prevent them, by applying suitable countermeasures that minimize the likelihood of an attack by the attacker. In this paper, we propose a stochastic game-theoretic approach for analyzing network security and synthesizing defense strategies to protect a network. To support analysis under partial observation, where some of the attacker's activities are unobservable or undetectable by the defender, we construct a one-sided partially observable security game and transform it into a perfect game for further analysis. We prove that this transformation is sound for a sub-class of security games and a subset of properties specified in the logic rPATL. We implement a prototype that fully automates our approach, and evaluate it by conducting experiments on a real-life network.

> The core operation of current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is the aggregation enabled by the graph Laplacian or message passing, which filters the neighborhood node information. Though effective for various tasks, in this paper, we show that they are potentially a problematic factor underlying all GNN methods for learning on certain datasets, as they force the node representations similar, making the nodes gradually lose their identity and become indistinguishable. Hence, we augment the aggregation operations with their dual, i.e. diversification operators that make the node more distinct and preserve the identity. Such augmentation replaces the aggregation with a two-channel filtering process that, in theory, is beneficial for enriching the node representations. In practice, the proposed two-channel filters can be easily patched on existing GNN methods with diverse training strategies, including spectral and spatial (message passing) methods. In the experiments, we observe desired characteristics of the models and significant performance boost upon the baselines on 9 node classification tasks.

> Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms have been widely used in image denoising and achieved satisfactory performance. However, the previous works mostly use a single head to receive the noisy image, limiting the richness of extracted features. Therefore, a novel CNN with multiple heads (MH) named MHCNN is proposed in this paper, whose heads will receive the input images rotated by different rotation angles. MH makes MHCNN simultaneously utilize features of rotated images to remove noise. To integrate these features effectively, we present a novel multi-path attention mechanism (MPA). Unlike previous attention mechanisms that handle pixel-level, channel-level, or patch-level features, MPA focuses on features at the image level. Experiments show MHCNN surpasses other state-of-the-art CNN models on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) denoising and real-world image denoising. Its peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) results are higher than other networks, such as BRDNet, RIDNet, PAN-Net, and CSANN. The code is accessible at https://github.com/JiaHongZ/MHCNN.

> Human activity recognition (HAR) is a machine learning task with important applications in healthcare especially in the context of home care of patients and older adults. HAR is often based on data collected from smart sensors, particularly smart home IoT devices such as smartphones, wearables and other body sensors. Deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used for HAR, both in centralized and federated settings. However, these techniques have certain limitations: RNNs cannot be easily parallelized, CNNs have the limitation of sequence length, and both are computationally expensive. Moreover, in home healthcare applications the centralized approach can raise serious privacy concerns since the sensors used by a HAR classifier collect a lot of highly personal and sensitive data about people in the home. In this paper, to address some of such challenges facing HAR, we propose a novel lightweight (one-patch) transformer, which can combine the advantages of RNNs and CNNs without their major limitations, and also TransFed, a more privacy-friendly, federated learning-based HAR classifier using our proposed lightweight transformer. We designed a testbed to construct a new HAR dataset from five recruited human participants, and used the new dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed HAR classifier in both federated and centralized settings. Additionally, we use another public dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed HAR classifier in centralized setting to compare it with existing HAR classifiers. The experimental results showed that our proposed new solution outperformed state-of-the-art HAR classifiers based on CNNs and RNNs, whiling being more computationally efficient.

> Unsupervised pixel-level defective region segmentation is an important task in image-based anomaly detection for various industrial applications. The state-of-the-art methods have their own advantages and limitations: matrix-decomposition-based methods are robust to noise but lack complex background image modeling capability; representation-based methods are good at defective region localization but lack accuracy in defective region shape contour extraction; reconstruction-based methods detected defective region match well with the ground truth defective region shape contour but are noisy. To combine the best of both worlds, we present an unsupervised patch autoencoder based deep image decomposition (PAEDID) method for defective region segmentation. In the training stage, we learn the common background as a deep image prior by a patch autoencoder (PAE) network. In the inference stage, we formulate anomaly detection as an image decomposition problem with the deep image prior and domain-specific regularizations. By adopting the proposed approach, the defective regions in the image can be accurately extracted in an unsupervised fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the PAEDID method in simulation studies and an industrial dataset in the case study.

> Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a competitive alternative to convolutional neural networks for various computer vision applications. Specifically, ViT multi-head attention layers make it possible to embed information globally across the overall image. Nevertheless, computing and storing such attention matrices incurs a quadratic cost dependency on the number of patches, limiting its achievable efficiency and scalability and prohibiting more extensive real-world ViT applications on resource-constrained devices. Sparse attention has been shown to be a promising direction for improving hardware acceleration efficiency for NLP models. However, a systematic counterpart approach is still missing for accelerating ViT models. To close the above gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind algorithm-hardware codesigned framework, dubbed ViTALiTy, for boosting the inference efficiency of ViTs. Unlike sparsity-based Transformer accelerators for NLP, ViTALiTy unifies both low-rank and sparse components of the attention in ViTs. At the algorithm level, we approximate the dot-product softmax operation via first-order Taylor attention with row-mean centering as the low-rank component to linearize the cost of attention blocks and further boost the accuracy by incorporating a sparsity-based regularization. At the hardware level, we develop a dedicated accelerator to better leverage the resulting workload and pipeline from ViTALiTy's linear Taylor attention which requires the execution of only the low-rank component, to further boost the hardware efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that ViTALiTy offers boosted end-to-end efficiency (e.g., $3\times$ faster and $3\times$ energy-efficient) under comparable accuracy, with respect to the state-of-the-art solution.

> Identifying the actual adversarial threat against a system vulnerability has been a long-standing challenge for cybersecurity research. To determine an optimal strategy for the defender, game-theoretic based decision models have been widely used to simulate the real-world attacker-defender scenarios while taking the defender's constraints into consideration. In this work, we focus on understanding human attacker behaviors in order to optimize the defender's strategy. To achieve this goal, we model attacker-defender engagements as Markov Games and search for their Bayesian Stackelberg Equilibrium. We validate our modeling approach and report our empirical findings using a Capture-The-Flag (CTF) setup, and we conduct user studies on adversaries with varying skill-levels. Our studies show that application-level deceptions are an optimal mitigation strategy against targeted attacks -- outperforming classic cyber-defensive maneuvers, such as patching or blocking network requests. We use this result to further hypothesize over the attacker's behaviors when trapped in an embedded honeypot environment and present a detailed analysis of the same.

> A large body of the literature on automated program repair develops approaches where patches are automatically generated to be validated against an oracle (e.g., a test suite). Because such an oracle can be imperfect, the generated patches, although validated by the oracle, may actually be incorrect. Our empirical work investigates different representation learning approaches for code changes to derive embeddings that are amenable to similarity computations of patch correctness identification, and assess the possibility of accurate classification of correct patch by combining learned embeddings with engineered features. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of learned embeddings to empower Leopard (a patch correctness predicting framework implemented in this work) with learning algorithms in reasoning about patch correctness: a machine learning predictor with BERT transformer-based learned embeddings associated with XGBoost achieves an AUC value of about 0.803 in the prediction of patch correctness on a new dataset of 2,147 labeled patches that we collected for the experiments. Our investigations show that deep learned embeddings can lead to complementary/better performance when comparing against the state-of-the-art, PATCH-SIM, which relies on dynamic information. By combining deep learned embeddings and engineered features, Panther (the upgraded version of Leopard implemented in this work) outperforms Leopard with higher scores in terms of AUC, +Recall and -Recall, and can accurately identify more (in)correct patches that cannot be predicted by the classifiers only with learned embeddings or engineered features. Finally, we use an explainable ML technique, SHAP, to empirically interpret how the learned embeddings and engineered features are contributed to the patch correctness prediction.

> Self-attention mechanisms, especially multi-head self-attention (MSA), have achieved great success in many fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, many existing vision transformer (ViT) works simply inherent transformer designs from NLP to adapt vision tasks, while ignoring the fundamental difference between ``how MSA works in image and language settings''. Language naturally contains highly semantic structures that are directly interpretable by humans. Its basic unit (word) is discrete without redundant information, which readily supports interpretable studies on MSA mechanisms of language transformer. In contrast, visual data exhibits a fundamentally different structure: Its basic unit (pixel) is a natural low-level representation with significant redundancies in the neighbourhood, which poses obvious challenges to the interpretability of MSA mechanism in ViT. In this paper, we introduce a typical image processing technique, i.e., scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFTs), which maps low-level representations into mid-level spaces, and annotates extensive discrete keypoints with semantically rich information. Next, we construct a weighted patch interrelation analysis based on SIFT keypoints to capture the attention patterns hidden in patches with different semantic concentrations Interestingly, we find this quantitative analysis is not only an effective complement to the interpretability of MSA mechanisms in ViT, but can also be applied to 1) spurious correlation discovery and ``prompting'' during model inference, 2) and guided model pre-training acceleration. Experimental results on both applications show significant advantages over baselines, demonstrating the efficacy of our method.

> Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables learning useful inductive biases through utilizing pretext tasks that require no labels. The unlabeled nature of SSL makes it especially important for whole slide histopathological images (WSIs), where patch-level human annotation is difficult. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) is a recent SSL method suitable for digital pathology as it does not require negative sampling and requires little to no data augmentations. However, the domain shift between natural images and digital pathology images requires further research in designing MAE for patch-level WSIs. In this paper, we investigate several design choices for MAE in histopathology. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-modal MAE (MMAE) that leverages the specific compositionality of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained WSIs. We performed our experiments on the public patch-level dataset NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The results show that the MMAE architecture outperforms supervised baselines and other state-of-the-art SSL techniques for an eight-class tissue phenotyping task, utilizing only 100 labeled samples for fine-tuning.

> Recent work has shown that deep vision models tend to be overly dependent on low-level or "texture" features, leading to poor generalization. Various data augmentation strategies have been proposed to overcome this so-called texture bias in DNNs. We propose a simple, lightweight adversarial augmentation technique that explicitly incentivizes the network to learn holistic shapes for accurate prediction in an object classification setting. Our augmentations superpose edgemaps from one image onto another image with shuffled patches, using a randomly determined mixing proportion, with the image label of the edgemap image. To classify these augmented images, the model needs to not only detect and focus on edges but distinguish between relevant and spurious edges. We show that our augmentations significantly improve classification accuracy and robustness measures on a range of datasets and neural architectures. As an example, for ViT-S, We obtain absolute gains on classification accuracy gains up to 6%. We also obtain gains of up to 28% and 8.5% on natural adversarial and out-of-distribution datasets like ImageNet-A (for ViT-B) and ImageNet-R (for ViT-S), respectively. Analysis using a range of probe datasets shows substantially increased shape sensitivity in our trained models, explaining the observed improvement in robustness and classification accuracy.

> Annotations are necessary to develop computer vision algorithms for histopathology, but dense annotations at a high resolution are often time-consuming to make. Deep learning models for segmentation are a way to alleviate the process, but require large amounts of training data, training times and computing power. To address these issues, we present seeded iterative clustering to produce a coarse segmentation densely and at the whole slide level. The algorithm uses precomputed representations as the clustering space and a limited amount of sparse interactive annotations as seeds to iteratively classify image patches. We obtain a fast and effective way of generating dense annotations for whole slide images and a framework that allows the comparison of neural network latent representations in the context of transfer learning.

> Land cover classification (LCC), and monitoring how land use changes over time, is an important process in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Existing approaches that use machine learning with Earth observation data for LCC rely on fully-annotated and segmented datasets. Creating these datasets requires a large amount of effort, and a lack of suitable datasets has become an obstacle in scaling the use of LCC. In this study, we propose Scene-to-Patch models: an alternative LCC approach utilising Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) that requires only high-level scene labels. This enables much faster development of new datasets whilst still providing segmentation through patch-level predictions, ultimately increasing the accessibility of using LCC for different scenarios. On the DeepGlobe-LCC dataset, our approach outperforms non-MIL baselines on both scene- and patch-level prediction. This work provides the foundation for expanding the use of LCC in climate change mitigation methods for technology, government, and academia.

> This paper proposes a probabilistic deep metric learning (PDML) framework for hyperspectral image classification, which aims to predict the category of each pixel for an image captured by hyperspectral sensors. The core problem for hyperspectral image classification is the spectral variability between intraclass materials and the spectral similarity between interclass materials, motivating the further incorporation of spatial information to differentiate a pixel based on its surrounding patch. However, different pixels and even the same pixel in one patch might not encode the same material due to the low spatial resolution of most hyperspectral sensors, leading to an inconsistent judgment of a specific pixel. To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic deep metric learning framework to model the categorical uncertainty of the spectral distribution of an observed pixel. We propose to learn a global probabilistic distribution for each pixel in the patch and a probabilistic metric to model the distance between distributions. We treat each pixel in a patch as a training sample, enabling us to exploit more information from the patch compared with conventional methods. Our framework can be readily applied to existing hyperspectral image classification methods with various network architectures and loss functions. Extensive experiments on four widely used datasets including IN, UP, KSC, and Houston 2013 datasets demonstrate that our framework improves the performance of existing methods and further achieves the state of the art.

> Early, precise detection of nutrient deficiency stress (NDS) has key economic as well as environmental impact; precision application of chemicals in place of blanket application reduces operational costs for the growers while reducing the amount of chemicals which may enter the environment unnecessarily. Furthermore, earlier treatment reduces the amount of loss and therefore boosts crop production during a given season. With this in mind, we collect sequences of high-resolution aerial imagery and construct semantic segmentation models to detect and predict NDS across the field. Our work sits at the intersection of agriculture, remote sensing, and modern computer vision and deep learning. First, we establish a baseline for full-field detection of NDS and quantify the impact of pretraining, backbone architecture, input representation, and sampling strategy. We then quantify the amount of information available at different points in the season by building a single-timestamp model based on a UNet. Next, we construct our proposed spatiotemporal architecture, which combines a UNet with a convolutional LSTM layer, to accurately detect regions of the field showing NDS; this approach has an impressive IOU score of 0.53. Finally, we show that this architecture can be trained to predict regions of the field which are expected to show NDS in a later flight -- potentially more than three weeks in the future -- maintaining an IOU score of 0.47-0.51 depending on how far in advance the prediction is made. We will also release a dataset which we believe will benefit the computer vision, remote sensing, as well as agriculture fields. This work contributes to the recent developments in deep learning for remote sensing and agriculture, while addressing a key social challenge with implications for economics and sustainability.

> Advances in remote sensing technology have led to the capture of massive amounts of data. Increased image resolution, more frequent revisit times, and additional spectral channels have created an explosion in the amount of data that is available to provide analyses and intelligence across domains, including agriculture. However, the processing of this data comes with a cost in terms of computation time and money, both of which must be considered when the goal of an algorithm is to provide real-time intelligence to improve efficiencies. Specifically, we seek to identify nutrient deficient areas from remotely sensed data to alert farmers to regions that require attention; detection of nutrient deficient areas is a key task in precision agriculture as farmers must quickly respond to struggling areas to protect their harvests. Past methods have focused on pixel-level classification (i.e. semantic segmentation) of the field to achieve these tasks, often using deep learning models with tens-of-millions of parameters. In contrast, we propose a much lighter graph-based method to perform node-based classification. We first use Simple Linear Iterative Cluster (SLIC) to produce superpixels across the field. Then, to perform segmentation across the non-Euclidean domain of superpixels, we leverage a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN). This model has 4-orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters than a CNN model and trains in a matter of minutes.

> Entity alignment aims to discover unique equivalent entity pairs with the same meaning across different knowledge graphs (KGs). Existing models have focused on projecting KGs into a latent embedding space so that inherent semantics between entities can be captured for entity alignment. However, the adverse impacts of alignment conflicts have been largely overlooked during training, thereby limiting the entity alignment performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Conflict-aware Pseudo Labeling via Optimal Transport model (CPL-OT) for entity alignment. The key idea is to iteratively pseudo-label alignment pairs empowered with conflict-aware optimal transport (OT) modeling to boost the precision of entity alignment. CPL-OT is composed of two key components -- entity embedding learning with global-local aggregation and iterative conflict-aware pseudo labeling -- that mutually reinforce each other. To mitigate alignment conflicts during pseudo labeling, we propose to use optimal transport as an effective means to warrant one-to-one entity alignment between two KGs with the minimal overall transport cost. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of CPL-OT over state-of-the-art baselines under both settings with and without prior alignment seeds.

> Vulnerability and risk assessment of neighborhoods is essential for effective disaster preparedness. Existing traditional systems, due to dependency on time-consuming and cost-intensive field surveying, do not provide a scalable way to decipher warnings and assess the precise extent of the risk at a hyper-local level. In this work, machine learning was used to automate the process of identifying dwellings and their type to build a potentially more effective disaster vulnerability assessment system. First, satellite imageries of low-income settlements and vulnerable areas in India were used to identify 7 different dwelling types. Specifically, we formulated the dwelling type classification as a semantic segmentation task and trained a U-net based neural network model, namely TernausNet, with the data we collected. Then a risk score assessment model was employed, using the determined dwelling type along with an inundation model of the regions. The entire pipeline was deployed to multiple locations prior to natural hazards in India in 2020. Post hoc ground-truth data from those regions was collected to validate the efficacy of this model which showed promising performance. This work can aid disaster response organizations and communities at risk by providing household-level risk information that can inform preemptive actions.

> Although neural networks have seen tremendous success as predictive models in a variety of domains, they can be overly confident in their predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To be viable for safety-critical applications, like autonomous vehicles, neural networks must accurately estimate their epistemic or model uncertainty, achieving a level of system self-awareness. Techniques for epistemic uncertainty quantification often require OOD data during training or multiple neural network forward passes during inference. These approaches may not be suitable for real-time performance on high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, existing methods lack interpretability of the estimated uncertainty, which limits their usefulness both to engineers for further system development and to downstream modules in the autonomy stack. We propose the use of evidential deep learning to estimate the epistemic uncertainty over a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space in a trajectory prediction setting. We introduce an interpretable paradigm for trajectory prediction that distributes the uncertainty among the semantic concepts: past agent behavior, road structure, and social context. We validate our approach on real-world autonomous driving data, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

> Mobile robots extract information from its environment to understand their current situation to enable intelligent decision making and autonomous task execution. In our previous work, we introduced the concept of Situation Graphs (S-Graphs) which combines in a single optimizable graph, the robot keyframes and the representation of the environment with geometric, semantic and topological abstractions. Although S-Graphs were built and optimized in real-time and demonstrated state-of-the-art results, they are limited to specific structured environments with specific hand-tuned dimensions of rooms and corridors.   In this work, we present an advanced version of the Situational Graphs (S-Graphs+), consisting of the five layered optimizable graph that includes (1) metric layer along with the graph of free-space clusters (2) keyframe layer where the robot poses are registered (3) metric-semantic layer consisting of the extracted planar walls (4) novel rooms layer constraining the extracted planar walls (5) novel floors layer encompassing the rooms within a given floor level. S-Graphs+ demonstrates improved performance over S-Graphs efficiently extracting the room information while simultaneously improving the pose estimate of the robot, thus extending the robots situational awareness in the form of a five layered environmental model.

> To better support retrieval applications such as web search and question answering, growing effort is made to develop retrieval-oriented language models. Most of the existing works focus on improving the semantic representation capability for the contextualized embedding of [CLS] token. However, recent study shows that the ordinary tokens besides [CLS] may provide extra information, which helps to produce a better representation effect. As such, it's necessary to extend the current methods where all contextualized embeddings can be jointly pre-trained for the retrieval tasks.   With this motivation, we propose a new pre-training method: duplex masked auto-encoder, a.k.a. DupMAE, which targets on improving the semantic representation capacity for the contextualized embeddings of both [CLS] and ordinary tokens. It introduces two decoding tasks: one is to reconstruct the original input sentence based on the [CLS] embedding, the other one is to minimize the bag-of-words loss (BoW) about the input sentence based on the entire ordinary tokens' embeddings. The two decoding losses are added up to train a unified encoding model. The embeddings from [CLS] and ordinary tokens, after dimension reduction and aggregation, are concatenated as one unified semantic representation for the input. DupMAE is simple but empirically competitive: with a small decoding cost, it substantially contributes to the model's representation capability and transferability, where remarkable improvements are achieved on MS MARCO and BEIR benchmarks.

> Compared to query-based black-box attacks, transfer-based black-box attacks do not require any information of the attacked models, which ensures their secrecy. However, most existing transfer-based approaches rely on ensembling multiple models to boost the attack transferability, which is time- and resource-intensive, not to mention the difficulty of obtaining diverse models on the same task. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on the single-model transfer-based black-box attack on object detection, utilizing only one model to achieve a high-transferability adversarial attack on multiple black-box detectors. Specifically, we first make observations on the patch optimization process of the existing method and propose an enhanced attack framework by slightly adjusting its training strategies. Then, we analogize patch optimization with regular model optimization, proposing a series of self-ensemble approaches on the input data, the attacked model, and the adversarial patch to efficiently make use of the limited information and prevent the patch from overfitting. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can be applied with multiple classical base attack methods (e.g., PGD and MIM) to greatly improve the black-box transferability of the well-optimized patch on multiple mainstream detectors, meanwhile boosting white-box performance.

> Adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors (ODs) have been studied extensively in the past few years. These attacks cause the model to make incorrect predictions by placing a patch containing an adversarial pattern on the target object or anywhere within the frame. However, none of prior research proposed a misclassification attack on ODs, in which the patch is applied on the target object. In this study, we propose a novel, universal, targeted, label-switch attack against the state-of-the-art object detector, YOLO. In our attack, we use (i) a tailored projection function to enable the placement of the adversarial patch on multiple target objects in the image (e.g., cars), each of which may be located a different distance away from the camera or have a different view angle relative to the camera, and (ii) a unique loss function capable of changing the label of the attacked objects. The proposed universal patch, which is trained in the digital domain, is transferable to the physical domain. We performed an extensive evaluation using different types of object detectors, different video streams captured by different cameras, and various target classes, and evaluated different configurations of the adversarial patch in the physical domain.

> The paper presents an approach to semantic grounding of language models (LMs) that conceptualizes the LM as a conditional model generating text given a desired semantic message formalized as a set of entity-relationship triples. It embeds the LM in an auto-encoder by feeding its output to a semantic parser whose output is in the same representation domain as the input message. Compared to a baseline that generates text using greedy search, we demonstrate two techniques that improve the fluency and semantic accuracy of the generated text: The first technique samples multiple candidate text sequences from which the semantic parser chooses. The second trains the language model while keeping the semantic parser frozen to improve the semantic accuracy of the auto-encoder. We carry out experiments on the English WebNLG 3.0 data set, using BLEU to measure the fluency of generated text and standard parsing metrics to measure semantic accuracy. We show that our proposed approaches significantly improve on the greedy search baseline. Human evaluation corroborates the results of the automatic evaluation experiments.

> Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn generalizable representations for image, text, audio, video, etc., by reconstructing masked input data from tokens of the visible data. Current MAE approaches for videos rely on random patch, tube, or frame-based masking strategies to select these tokens. This paper proposes AdaMAE, an adaptive masking strategy for MAEs that is end-to-end trainable. Our adaptive masking strategy samples visible tokens based on the semantic context using an auxiliary sampling network. This network estimates a categorical distribution over spacetime-patch tokens. The tokens that increase the expected reconstruction error are rewarded and selected as visible tokens, motivated by the policy gradient algorithm in reinforcement learning. We show that AdaMAE samples more tokens from the high spatiotemporal information regions, thereby allowing us to mask 95% of tokens, resulting in lower memory requirements and faster pre-training. We conduct ablation studies on the Something-Something v2 (SSv2) dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our adaptive sampling approach and report state-of-the-art results of 70.0% and 81.7% in top-1 accuracy on SSv2 and Kinetics-400 action classification datasets with a ViT-Base backbone and 800 pre-training epochs.

> Medical images are widely used in clinical practice for diagnosis. Automatically generating interpretable medical reports can reduce radiologists' burden and facilitate timely care. However, most existing approaches to automatic report generation require sufficient labeled data for training. In addition, the learned model can only generate reports for the training classes, lacking the ability to adapt to previously unseen novel diseases. To this end, we propose a lesion guided explainable few weak-shot medical report generation framework that learns correlation between seen and novel classes through visual and semantic feature alignment, aiming to generate medical reports for diseases not observed in training. It integrates a lesion-centric feature extractor and a Transformer-based report generation module. Concretely, the lesion-centric feature extractor detects the abnormal regions and learns correlations between seen and novel classes with multi-view (visual and lexical) embeddings. Then, features of the detected regions and corresponding embeddings are concatenated as multi-view input to the report generation module for explainable report generation, including text descriptions and corresponding abnormal regions detected in the images. We conduct experiments on FFA-IR, a dataset providing explainable annotations, showing that our framework outperforms others on report generation for novel diseases.

> Meaning of words constantly changes given the events in modern civilization. Large Language Models use word embeddings, which are often static and thus cannot cope with this semantic change. Thus,it is important to resolve ambiguity in word meanings. This paper is an effort in this direction, where we explore methods for word sense disambiguation for the EvoNLP shared task. We conduct rigorous ablations for two solutions to this problem. We see that an approach using time-aware language models helps this task. Furthermore, we explore possible future directions to this problem.

> Handwriting recognition is one of the desirable attributes of document comprehension and analysis. It is concerned with the documents writing style and characteristics that distinguish the authors. The diversity of text images, notably in images with varying handwriting, makes the process of learning good features difficult in cases where little data is available. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to identify the author of a document based on the input word image. Our method is text independent and does not impose any constraint on the size of the input image under examination. To begin with, we detect crucial components in handwriting and extract regions surrounding them using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). These patches are designed to capture individual writing features (including allographs, characters, or combinations of characters) that are likely to be unique for an individual writer. These features are then passed through a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in which the weights are learned by applying the concept of Similarity learning using Siamese network. Siamese network enhances the discrimination power of CNN by mapping similarity between different pairs of input image. Features learned at different scales of the extracted SIFT key-points are encoded using Sparse PCA, each components of the Sparse PCA is assigned a saliency score signifying its level of significance in discriminating different writers effectively. Finally, the weighted Sparse PCA corresponding to each SIFT key-points is combined to arrive at a final classification score for each writer. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on two publicly available databases (namely IAM and CVL) and is able to achieve promising result, when compared with other deep learning based algorithm.

> Deep neural networks have recently achieved considerable improvements in learning human behavioral patterns and individual preferences from massive spatial-temporal trajectories data. However, most of the existing research concentrates on fusing different semantics underlying sequential trajectories for mobility pattern learning which, in turn, yields a narrow perspective on comprehending human intrinsic motions. In addition, the inherent sparsity and under-explored heterogeneous collaborative items pertaining to human check-ins hinder the potential exploitation of human diverse periodic regularities as well as common interests. Motivated by recent advances in disentanglement learning, in this study we propose a novel disentangled solution called SSDL for tackling the next POI prediction problem. SSDL primarily seeks to disentangle the potential time-invariant and time-varying factors into different latent spaces from massive trajectories data, providing an interpretable view to understand the intricate semantics underlying human diverse mobility representations. To address the data sparsity issue, we present two realistic trajectory augmentation approaches to enhance the understanding of both the human intrinsic periodicity and constantly-changing intents. In addition, we devise a POI-centric graph structure to explore heterogeneous collaborative signals underlying historical check-ins. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed SSDL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches -- for example, it yields up to 8.57% improvements on ACC@1.

> Explaining the behavior of AI systems is an important problem that, in practice, is generally avoided. While the XAI community has been developing an abundance of techniques, most incur a set of costs that the wider deep learning community has been unwilling to pay in most situations. We take a pragmatic view of the issue, and define a set of desiderata that capture both the ambitions of XAI and the practical constraints of deep learning. We describe an effective way to satisfy all the desiderata: train the AI system to build a causal model of itself. We develop an instance of this solution for Deep RL agents: Causal Self-Talk. CST operates by training the agent to communicate with itself across time. We implement this method in a simulated 3D environment, and show how it enables agents to generate faithful and semantically-meaningful explanations of their own behavior. Beyond explanations, we also demonstrate that these learned models provide new ways of building semantic control interfaces to AI systems.

> Knowledge Graph (KG) errors introduce non-negligible noise, severely affecting KG-related downstream tasks. Detecting errors in KGs is challenging since the patterns of errors are unknown and diverse, while ground-truth labels are rare or even unavailable. A traditional solution is to construct logical rules to verify triples, but it is not generalizable since different KGs have distinct rules with domain knowledge involved. Recent studies focus on designing tailored detectors or ranking triples based on KG embedding loss. However, they all rely on negative samples for training, which are generated by randomly replacing the head or tail entity of existing triples. Such a negative sampling strategy is not enough for prototyping practical KG errors, e.g., (Bruce_Lee, place_of_birth, China), in which the three elements are often relevant, although mismatched. We desire a more effective unsupervised learning mechanism tailored for KG error detection. To this end, we propose a novel framework - ContrAstive knowledge Graph Error Detection (CAGED). It introduces contrastive learning into KG learning and provides a novel way of modeling KG. Instead of following the traditional setting, i.e., considering entities as nodes and relations as semantic edges, CAGED augments a KG into different hyper-views, by regarding each relational triple as a node. After joint training with KG embedding and contrastive learning loss, CAGED assesses the trustworthiness of each triple based on two learning signals, i.e., the consistency of triple representations across multi-views and the self-consistency within the triple. Extensive experiments on three real-world KGs show that CAGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in KG error detection. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Qing145/CAGED.git.

> Learning representations of multimodal data that are both informative and robust to missing modalities at test time remains a challenging problem due to the inherent heterogeneity of data obtained from different channels. To address it, we present a novel Geometric Multimodal Contrastive (GMC) representation learning method consisting of two main components: i) a two-level architecture consisting of modality-specific base encoders, allowing to process an arbitrary number of modalities to an intermediate representation of fixed dimensionality, and a shared projection head, mapping the intermediate representations to a latent representation space; ii) a multimodal contrastive loss function that encourages the geometric alignment of the learned representations. We experimentally demonstrate that GMC representations are semantically rich and achieve state-of-the-art performance with missing modality information on three different learning problems including prediction and reinforcement learning tasks.

> Objective: Reveal and quantify qualities of reported experiences of chronic pain on social media, from multiple pathological backgrounds, by means of the novel Reddit Reports of Chronic Pain (RRCP) dataset, using Natural Language Processing techniques. Materials and Methods: Define and validate the RRCP dataset for a set of subreddits related to chronic pain. Identify the main concerns discussed in each subreddit. Model each subreddit according to their main concerns. Compare subreddit models. Results: The RRCP dataset comprises 86,537 Reddit submissions from 12 subreddits related to chronic pain (each related to one pathological background). Each RRCP subreddit has various main concerns. Some of these concerns are shared between multiple subreddits (e.g., the subreddit Sciatica semantically entails the subreddit backpain in their various concerns, but not the other way around), whilst some concerns are exclusive to specific subreddits (e.g., Interstitialcystitis and CrohnsDisease). Discussion: These results suggest that the reported experience of chronic pain, from multiple pathologies (i.e., subreddits), has concerns relevant to all, and concerns exclusive to certain pathologies. Our analysis details each of these concerns and their similarity relations. Conclusion: Although limited by intrinsic qualities of the Reddit platform, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work attempting to model the linguistic expression of various chronic pain-inducing pathologies and comparing these models to identify and quantify the similarities and differences between the corresponding emergent chronic pain experiences.

> Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) can be used to reduce radiation dose greatly but is suffers from severe image artifacts. Recently, the deep learning based method for sparse-view CT reconstruction has attracted a major attention. However, neural networks often have a limited ability to remove the artifacts when they only work in the image domain. Deep learning-based sinogram processing can achieve a better anti-artifact performance, but it inevitably requires feature maps of the whole image in a video memory, which makes handling large-scale or three-dimensional (3D) images rather challenging. In this paper, we propose a patch-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. A DDPM network based on patches extracted from fully sampled projection data is trained and then used to inpaint down-sampled projection data. The network does not require paired full-sampled and down-sampled data, enabling unsupervised learning. Since the data processing is patch-based, the deep learning workflow can be distributed in parallel, overcoming the memory problem of large-scale data. Our experiments show that the proposed method can effectively suppress few-view artifacts while faithfully preserving textural details.

> The cornerstone of multilingual neural translation is shared representations across languages. Given the theoretically infinite representation power of neural networks, semantically identical sentences are likely represented differently. While representing sentences in the continuous latent space ensures expressiveness, it introduces the risk of capturing of irrelevant features which hinders the learning of a common representation. In this work, we discretize the encoder output latent space of multilingual models by assigning encoder states to entries in a codebook, which in effect represents source sentences in a new artificial language. This discretization process not only offers a new way to interpret the otherwise black-box model representations, but, more importantly, gives potential for increasing robustness in unseen testing conditions. We validate our approach on large-scale experiments with realistic data volumes and domains. When tested in zero-shot conditions, our approach is competitive with two strong alternatives from the literature. We also use the learned artificial language to analyze model behavior, and discover that using a similar bridge language increases knowledge-sharing among the remaining languages.

> Knowledge graph embedding techniques are widely used for knowledge graph refinement tasks such as graph completion and triple classification. These techniques aim at embedding the entities and relations of a Knowledge Graph (KG) in a low dimensional continuous feature space. This paper adopts a transformer-based triplet network creating an embedding space that clusters the information about an entity or relation in the KG. It creates textual sequences from facts and fine-tunes a triplet network of pre-trained transformer-based language models. It adheres to an evaluation paradigm that relies on an efficient spatial semantic search technique. We show that this evaluation protocol is more adapted to a few-shot setting for the relation prediction task. Our proposed GilBERT method is evaluated on triplet classification and relation prediction tasks on multiple well-known benchmark knowledge graphs such as FB13, WN11, and FB15K. We show that GilBERT achieves better or comparable results to the state-of-the-art performance on these two refinement tasks.

> Person text-image matching, also known as text based person search, aims to retrieve images of specific pedestrians using text descriptions. Although person text-image matching has made great research progress, existing methods still face two challenges. First, the lack of interpretability of text features makes it challenging to effectively align them with their corresponding image features. Second, the same pedestrian image often corresponds to multiple different text descriptions, and a single text description can correspond to multiple different images of the same identity. The diversity of text descriptions and images makes it difficult for a network to extract robust features that match the two modalities. To address these problems, we propose a person text-image matching method by embedding text-feature interpretability and an external attack node. Specifically, we improve the interpretability of text features by providing them with consistent semantic information with image features to achieve the alignment of text and describe image region features.To address the challenges posed by the diversity of text and the corresponding person images, we treat the variation caused by diversity to features as caused by perturbation information and propose a novel adversarial attack and defense method to solve it. In the model design, graph convolution is used as the basic framework for feature representation and the adversarial attacks caused by text and image diversity on feature extraction is simulated by implanting an additional attack node in the graph convolution layer to improve the robustness of the model against text and image diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of text-pedestrian image matching over existing methods. The source code of the method is published at

> By and large, existing computational models of visual attention tacitly assume perfect vision and full access to the stimulus and thereby deviate from foveated biological vision. Moreover, modeling top-down attention is generally reduced to the integration of semantic features without incorporating the signal of a high-level visual tasks that have been shown to partially guide human attention. We propose the Neural Visual Attention (NeVA) algorithm to generate visual scanpaths in a top-down manner. With our method, we explore the ability of neural networks on which we impose a biologically-inspired foveated vision constraint to generate human-like scanpaths without directly training for this objective. The loss of a neural network performing a downstream visual task (i.e., classification or reconstruction) flexibly provides top-down guidance to the scanpath. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised human attention models in terms of similarity to human scanpaths. Additionally, the flexibility of the framework allows to quantitatively investigate the role of different tasks in the generated visual behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the approach in a novel experiment that investigates the utility of scanpaths in real-world applications, where imperfect viewing conditions are given.

> We propose a new uniform framework for text classification and ranking that can automate the process of identifying check-worthy sentences in political debates and speech transcripts. Our framework combines the semantic analysis of the sentences, with additional entity embeddings obtained through the identified entities within the sentences. In particular, we analyse the semantic meaning of each sentence using state-of-the-art neural language models such as BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa, while embeddings for entities are obtained from knowledge graph (KG) embedding models. Specifically, we instantiate our framework using five different language models, entity embeddings obtained from six different KG embedding models, as well as two combination methods leading to several Entity-Assisted neural language models. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our framework using two publicly available datasets from the CLEF' 2019 & 2020 CheckThat! Labs. Our results show that the neural language models significantly outperform traditional TF.IDF and LSTM methods. In addition, we show that the ALBERT model is consistently the most effective model among all the tested neural language models. Our entity embeddings significantly outperform other existing approaches from the literature that are based on similarity and relatedness scores between the entities in a sentence, when used alongside a KG embedding.

> Most of the existing algorithms for zero-shot classification problems typically rely on the attribute-based semantic relations among categories to realize the classification of novel categories without observing any of their instances. However, training the zero-shot classification models still requires attribute labeling for each class (or even instance) in the training dataset, which is also expensive. To this end, in this paper, we bring up a new problem scenario: "Can we derive zero-shot learning for novel attribute detectors/classifiers and use them to automatically annotate the dataset for labeling efficiency?". Basically, given only a small set of detectors that are learned to recognize some manually annotated attributes (i.e., the seen attributes), we aim to synthesize the detectors of novel attributes in a zero-shot learning manner. Our proposed method, Zero-Shot Learning for Attributes (ZSLA), which is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge, tackles this new research problem by applying the set operations to first decompose the seen attributes into their basic attributes and then recombine these basic attributes into the novel ones. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the capacity of our synthesized detectors for accurately capturing the semantics of the novel attributes and show their superior performance in terms of detection and localization compared to other baseline approaches. Moreover, we demonstrate the application of automatic annotation using our synthesized detectors on Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. Various generalized zero-shot classification algorithms trained upon the dataset re-annotated by ZSLA show comparable performance with those trained with the manual ground-truth annotations.

> Supervised learning tasks such as cancer survival prediction from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) are a critical challenge in computational pathology that requires modeling complex features of the tumor microenvironment. These learning tasks are often solved with deep multi-instance learning (MIL) models that do not explicitly capture intratumoral heterogeneity. We develop a novel variance pooling architecture that enables a MIL model to incorporate intratumoral heterogeneity into its predictions. Two interpretability tools based on representative patches are illustrated to probe the biological signals captured by these models. An empirical study with 4,479 gigapixel WSIs from the Cancer Genome Atlas shows that adding variance pooling onto MIL frameworks improves survival prediction performance for five cancer types.

> Ontologies serve as a one of the formal means to represent and model knowledge in computer science, electrical engineering, system engineering and other related disciplines. Ontologies within requirements engineering may be used for formal representation of system requirements. In the Internet of Things, ontologies may be used to represent sensor knowledge and describe acquired data semantics. Designing an ontology comprehensive enough with an appropriate level of knowledge expressiveness, serving multiple purposes, from system requirements specifications to modeling knowledge based on data from IoT sensors, is one of the great challenges. This paper proposes an approach towards ontology-based requirements engineering for well-being, aging and health supported by the Internet of Things. Such an ontology design does not aim at creating a new ontology, but extending the appropriate one already existing, SAREF4EHAW, in order align with the well-being, aging and health concepts and structure the knowledge within the domain. Other contributions include a conceptual formulation for Well-Being, Aging and Health and a related taxonomy, as well as a concept of One Well-Being, Aging and Health. New attributes and relations have been proposed for the new ontology extension, along with the updated list of use cases and particular ontological requirements not covered by the original ontology.

> Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently obtained success in many applications, but their intensive computation and heavy memory usage at both training and inference time limit their generalization. Previous compression algorithms usually start from the pre-trained dense models and only focus on efficient inference, while time-consuming training is still unavoidable. In contrast, this paper points out that the million-scale training data is redundant, which is the fundamental reason for the tedious training. To address the issue, this paper aims to introduce sparsity into data and proposes an end-to-end efficient training framework from three sparse perspectives, dubbed Tri-Level E-ViT. Specifically, we leverage a hierarchical data redundancy reduction scheme, by exploring the sparsity under three levels: number of training examples in the dataset, number of patches (tokens) in each example, and number of connections between tokens that lie in attention weights. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed technique can noticeably accelerate training for various ViT architectures while maintaining accuracy. Remarkably, under certain ratios, we are able to improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it. For example, we can achieve 15.2% speedup with 72.6% (+0.4) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-T, and 15.7% speedup with 79.9% (+0.1) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-S. This proves the existence of data redundancy in ViT.

> This paper evaluates whether training a decision tree based on concepts extracted from a concept-based explainer can increase interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models and boost the fidelity and performance of the used explainer. CNNs for computer vision have shown exceptional performance in critical industries. However, it is a significant barrier when deploying CNNs due to their complexity and lack of interpretability. Recent studies to explain computer vision models have shifted from extracting low-level features (pixel-based explanations) to mid-or high-level features (concept-based explanations). The current research direction tends to use extracted features in developing approximation algorithms such as linear or decision tree models to interpret an original model. In this work, we modify one of the state-of-the-art concept-based explanations and propose an alternative framework named TreeICE. We design a systematic evaluation based on the requirements of fidelity (approximate models to original model's labels), performance (approximate models to ground-truth labels), and interpretability (meaningful of approximate models to humans). We conduct computational evaluation (for fidelity and performance) and human subject experiments (for interpretability) We find that Tree-ICE outperforms the baseline in interpretability and generates more human readable explanations in the form of a semantic tree structure. This work features how important to have more understandable explanations when interpretability is crucial.

> Recently, Dense Retrieval (DR) has become a promising solution to document retrieval, where document representations are used to perform effective and efficient semantic search. However, DR remains challenging on long documents, due to the quadratic complexity of its Transformer-based encoder and the finite capacity of a low-dimension embedding. Current DR models use suboptimal strategies such as truncating or splitting-and-pooling to long documents leading to poor utilization of whole document information. In this work, to tackle this problem, we propose Segment representation learning for long documents Dense Retrieval (SeDR). In SeDR, Segment-Interaction Transformer is proposed to encode long documents into document-aware and segment-sensitive representations, while it holds the complexity of splitting-and-pooling and outperforms other segment-interaction patterns on DR. Since GPU memory requirements for long document encoding causes insufficient negatives for DR training, Late-Cache Negative is further proposed to provide additional cache negatives for optimizing representation learning. Experiments on MS MARCO and TREC-DL datasets show that SeDR achieves superior performance among DR models, and confirm the effectiveness of SeDR on long document retrieval.

> We propose a new kind of embedding for natural language text that deeply represents semantic meaning. Standard text embeddings use the outputs from hidden layers of a pretrained language model. In our method, we let a language model learn from the text and then literally pick its brain, taking the actual weights of the model's neurons to generate a vector. We call this representation of the text a neural embedding. We confirm the ability of this representation to reflect semantics of the text by an analysis of its behavior on several datasets, and by a comparison of neural embedding with state of the art sentence embeddings.

> Contextual synonym knowledge is crucial for those similarity-oriented tasks whose core challenge lies in capturing semantic similarity between entities in their contexts, such as entity linking and entity matching. However, most Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) lack synonym knowledge due to inherent limitations of their pre-training objectives such as masked language modeling (MLM). Existing works which inject synonym knowledge into PLMs often suffer from two severe problems: (i) Neglecting the ambiguity of synonyms, and (ii) Undermining semantic understanding of original PLMs, which is caused by inconsistency between the exact semantic similarity of the synonyms and the broad conceptual relevance learned from the original corpus. To address these issues, we propose PICSO, a flexible framework that supports the injection of contextual synonym knowledge from multiple domains into PLMs via a novel entity-aware Adapter which focuses on the semantics of the entities (synonyms) in the contexts. Meanwhile, PICSO stores the synonym knowledge in additional parameters of the Adapter structure, which prevents it from corrupting the semantic understanding of the original PLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICSO can dramatically outperform the original PLMs and the other knowledge and synonym injection models on four different similarity-oriented tasks. In addition, experiments on GLUE prove that PICSO also benefits general natural language understanding tasks. Codes and data will be public.

> This paper studies the limits of language models' statistical learning in the context of Zipf's law. First, we demonstrate that Zipf-law token distribution emerges irrespective of the chosen tokenization. Second, we show that Zipf distribution is characterized by two distinct groups of tokens that differ both in terms of their frequency and their semantics. Namely, the tokens that have a one-to-one correspondence with one semantic concept have different statistical properties than those with semantic ambiguity. Finally, we demonstrate how these properties interfere with statistical learning procedures motivated by distributional semantics.

> Over the last years, software development in domains with high security demands transitioned from traditional methodologies to uniting modern approaches from software development and operations (DevOps). Key principles of DevOps gained more importance and are now applied to security aspects of software development, resulting in the automation of security-enhancing activities. In particular, it is common practice to use automated security testing tools that generate reports after inspecting a software artifact from multiple perspectives. However, this raises the challenge of generating duplicate security findings. To identify these duplicate findings manually, a security expert has to invest resources like time, effort, and knowledge. A partial automation of this process could reduce the analysis effort, encourage DevOps principles, and diminish the chance of human error. In this study, we investigated the potential of applying Natural Language Processing for clustering semantically similar security findings to support the identification of problem-specific duplicate findings. Towards this goal, we developed a web application for annotating and assessing security testing tool reports and published a human-annotated corpus of clustered security findings. In addition, we performed a comparison of different semantic similarity techniques for automatically grouping security findings. Finally, we assess the resulting clusters using both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods.

> Current approaches for fixing systematic problems in NLP models (e.g. regex patches, finetuning on more data) are either brittle, or labor-intensive and liable to shortcuts. In contrast, humans often provide corrections to each other through natural language. Taking inspiration from this, we explore natural language patches -- declarative statements that allow developers to provide corrective feedback at the right level of abstraction, either overriding the model (``if a review gives 2 stars, the sentiment is negative'') or providing additional information the model may lack (``if something is described as the bomb, then it is good''). We model the task of determining if a patch applies separately from the task of integrating patch information, and show that with a small amount of synthetic data, we can teach models to effectively use real patches on real data -- 1 to 7 patches improve accuracy by ~1-4 accuracy points on different slices of a sentiment analysis dataset, and F1 by 7 points on a relation extraction dataset. Finally, we show that finetuning on as many as 100 labeled examples may be needed to match the performance of a small set of language patches.

> In this work we challenge the common approach of using a one-to-one mapping ('translation') between the source and target domains in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Instead, we rely on stochastic translation to capture inherent translation ambiguities. This allows us to (i) train more accurate target networks by generating multiple outputs conditioned on the same source image, leveraging both accurate translation and data augmentation for appearance variability, (ii) impute robust pseudo-labels for the target data by averaging the predictions of a source network on multiple translated versions of a single target image and (iii) train and ensemble diverse networks in the target domain by modulating the degree of stochasticity in the translations. We report improvements over strong recent baselines, leading to state-of-the-art UDA results on two challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks.

> We present an anisotropic $hp-$mesh adaptation strategy using a continuous mesh model for discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) finite element schemes with optimal test functions, extending our previous work on $h-$adaptation. The proposed strategy utilizes the inbuilt residual-based error estimator of the DPG discretization to compute both the polynomial distribution and the anisotropy of the mesh elements. In order to predict the optimal order of approximation, we solve local problems on element patches, thus making these computations highly parallelizable. The continuous mesh model is formulated either with respect to the error in the solution, measured in a suitable norm, or with respect to certain admissible target functionals. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy using several numerical examples on triangular grids.

> Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to identify named entities with very little annotated data. Previous methods solve this problem based on token-wise classification, which ignores the information of entity boundaries, and inevitably the performance is affected by the massive non-entity tokens. To this end, we propose a seminal span-based prototypical network (SpanProto) that tackles few-shot NER via a two-stage approach, including span extraction and mention classification. In the span extraction stage, we transform the sequential tags into a global boundary matrix, enabling the model to focus on the explicit boundary information. For mention classification, we leverage prototypical learning to capture the semantic representations for each labeled span and make the model better adapt to novel-class entities. To further improve the model performance, we split out the false positives generated by the span extractor but not labeled in the current episode set, and then present a margin-based loss to separate them from each prototype region. Experiments over multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms strong baselines by a large margin.

> In natural language processing, extreme multi-label text classification is an emerging but essential task. The problem of extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) is to recall some of the most relevant labels for a text from an extremely large label set. Large-scale pre-trained models have brought a new trend to this problem. Though the large-scale pre-trained models have made significant achievements on this problem, the valuable fine-tuned methods have yet to be studied. Though label semantics have been introduced in XMTC, the vast semantic gap between texts and labels has yet to gain enough attention. This paper builds a new guide network (GUDN) to help fine-tune the pre-trained model to instruct classification later. Furthermore, GUDN uses raw label semantics combined with a helpful label reinforcement strategy to effectively explore the latent space between texts and labels, narrowing the semantic gap, which can further improve predicted accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that GUDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Eurlex-4k and has competitive results on other popular datasets. In an additional experiment, we investigated the input lengths' influence on the Transformer-based model's accuracy. Our source code is released at https://t.hk.uy/aFSH.

> Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been of significant interest for various computer vision applications. Recent successful methods rely on the current progress in deep neural network architectural designs (e.g., with vision transformers). Motivated by the recent progress achieved with state-of-the-art conditional generative models, we present a novel patch-based image restoration algorithm based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our patch-based diffusion modeling approach enables size-agnostic image restoration by using a guided denoising process with smoothed noise estimates across overlapping patches during inference. We empirically evaluate our model on benchmark datasets for image desnowing, combined deraining and dehazing, and raindrop removal. We demonstrate our approach to achieve state-of-the-art performances on both weather-specific and multi-weather image restoration, and experimentally show strong generalization to real-world test images.

> Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) and emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) are key research topics for computers to understand human behaviors. From a psychological perspective, emotions are the expression of affect or feelings during a short period, while sentiments are formed and held for a longer period. However, most existing works study sentiment and emotion separately and do not fully exploit the complementary knowledge behind the two. In this paper, we propose a multimodal sentiment knowledge-sharing framework (UniMSE) that unifies MSA and ERC tasks from features, labels, and models. We perform modality fusion at the syntactic and semantic levels and introduce contrastive learning between modalities and samples to better capture the difference and consistency between sentiments and emotions. Experiments on four public benchmark datasets, MOSI, MOSEI, MELD, and IEMOCAP, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve consistent improvements compared with state-of-the-art methods.

> Diffusion models have shown impressive results in text-to-image synthesis. Using massive datasets of captioned images, diffusion models learn to generate raster images of highly diverse objects and scenes. However, designers frequently use vector representations of images like Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) for digital icons or art. Vector graphics can be scaled to any size, and are compact. We show that a text-conditioned diffusion model trained on pixel representations of images can be used to generate SVG-exportable vector graphics. We do so without access to large datasets of captioned SVGs. By optimizing a differentiable vector graphics rasterizer, our method, VectorFusion, distills abstract semantic knowledge out of a pretrained diffusion model. Inspired by recent text-to-3D work, we learn an SVG consistent with a caption using Score Distillation Sampling. To accelerate generation and improve fidelity, VectorFusion also initializes from an image sample. Experiments show greater quality than prior work, and demonstrate a range of styles including pixel art and sketches. See our project webpage at https://ajayj.com/vectorfusion .

> Topological Spatial Model Checking is a recent paradigm where model checking techniques are developed for the topological interpretation of Modal Logic. The Spatial Logic of Closure Spaces, SLCS, extends Modal Logic with reachability connectives that, in turn, can be used for expressing interesting spatial properties, such as "being near to" or "being surrounded by". SLCS constitutes the kernel of a solid logical framework for reasoning about discrete space, such as graphs and digital images, interpreted as quasi discrete closure spaces. Following a recently developed geometric semantics of Modal Logic, we propose an interpretation of SLCS in continuous space, admitting a geometric spatial model checking procedure, by resorting to models based on polyhedra. Such representations of space are increasingly relevant in many domains of application, due to recent developments of 3D scanning and visualisation techniques that exploit mesh processing. We introduce PolyLogicA, a geometric spatial model checker for SLCS formulas on polyhedra and demonstrate feasibility of our approach on two 3D polyhedral models of realistic size. Finally, we introduce a geometric definition of bisimilarity, proving that it characterises logical equivalence.

> Many optimization algorithm benchmarking platforms allow users to share their experimental data to promote reproducible and reusable research. However, different platforms use different data models and formats, which drastically complicates the identification of relevant datasets, their interpretation, and their interoperability. Therefore, a semantically rich, ontology-based, machine-readable data model that can be used by different platforms is highly desirable. In this paper, we report on the development of such an ontology, which we call OPTION (OPTImization algorithm benchmarking ONtology). Our ontology provides the vocabulary needed for semantic annotation of the core entities involved in the benchmarking process, such as algorithms, problems, and evaluation measures. It also provides means for automatic data integration, improved interoperability, and powerful querying capabilities, thereby increasing the value of the benchmarking data. We demonstrate the utility of OPTION, by annotating and querying a corpus of benchmark performance data from the BBOB collection of the COCO framework and from the Yet Another Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (YABBOB) family of the Nevergrad environment. In addition, we integrate features of the BBOB functional performance landscape into the OPTION knowledge base using publicly available datasets with exploratory landscape analysis. Finally, we integrate the OPTION knowledge base into the IOHprofiler environment and provide users with the ability to perform meta-analysis of performance data.

We propose a logic over symbolic traces able to specify recursive procedures in a modular manner that refers to specified programs only in terms of events. We also provide a deduction system based on symbolic execution and induction that we prove to be sound relative to a trace semantics.

> Learning neural networks using only few available information is an important ongoing research topic with tremendous potential for applications. In this paper, we introduce a powerful regularizer for the variational modeling of inverse problems in imaging. Our regularizer, called patch normalizing flow regularizer (patchNR), involves a normalizing flow learned on small patches of very few images. In particular, the training is independent of the considered inverse problem such that the same regularizer can be applied for different forward operators acting on the same class of images. By investigating the distribution of patches versus those of the whole image class, we prove that our model is indeed a MAP approach. Numerical examples for low-dose and limited-angle computed tomography (CT) as well as superresolution of material images demonstrate that our method provides very high quality results. The training set consists of just six images for CT and one image for superresolution. Finally, we combine our patchNR with ideas from internal learning for performing superresolution of natural images directly from the low-resolution observation without knowledge of any high-resolution image.

> Fault localization, aiming at localizing the root cause of the bug under repair, has been a longstanding research topic. Although many approaches have been proposed in the last decades, most of the existing studies work at coarse-grained statement or method levels with very limited insights about how to repair the bug (granularity problem), but few studies target the finer-grained fault localization. In this paper, we target the granularity problem and propose a novel finer-grained variable-level fault localization technique. Specifically, we design a program-dependency-enhanced decision tree model to boost the identification of fault-relevant variables via discriminating failed and passed test cases based on the variable values. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have implemented it in a tool called VARDT and conducted an extensive study over the Defects4J benchmark. The results show that VARDT outperforms the state-of-the-art fault localization approaches with at least 247.8% improvements in terms of bugs located at Top-1, and the average improvements are 330.5%.   Besides, to investigate whether our finer-grained fault localization result can further improve the effectiveness of downstream APR techniques, we have adapted VARDT to the application of patch filtering, where VARDT outperforms the state-of-the-art PATCH-SIM by filtering 26.0% more incorrect patches. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and it also provides a new way of thinking for improving automatic program repair techniques.

> Biofouling is a major challenge for sustainable shipping, filter membranes, heat exchangers, and medical devices. The development of fouling-resistant coatings requires the evaluation of their effectiveness. Such an evaluation is usually based on the assessment of fouling progression after different exposure times to the target medium (e.g., salt water). The manual assessment of macrofouling requires expert knowledge about local fouling communities due to high variances in phenotypical appearance, has single-image sampling inaccuracies for certain species, and lacks spatial information. Here we present an approach for automatic image-based macrofouling analysis. We created a dataset with dense labels prepared from field panel images and propose a convolutional network (adapted U-Net) for the semantic segmentation of different macrofouling classes. The establishment of macrofouling localization allows for the generation of a successional model which enables the determination of direct surface attachment and in-depth epibiotic studies.

> This work is motivated by the scarcity of tools for accurate, unsupervised information extraction from unstructured clinical notes in computationally underrepresented languages, such as Czech. We introduce a stepping stone to a broad array of downstream tasks such as summarisation or integration of individual patient records, extraction of structured information for national cancer registry reporting or building of semi-structured semantic patient representations for computing patient embeddings. More specifically, we present a method for unsupervised extraction of semantically-labelled textual segments from clinical notes and test it out on a dataset of Czech breast cancer patients, provided by Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (the largest Czech hospital specialising in oncology). Our goal was to extract, classify (i.e. label) and cluster segments of the free-text notes that correspond to specific clinical features (e.g., family background, comorbidities or toxicities). The presented results demonstrate the practical relevance of the proposed approach for building more sophisticated extraction and analytical pipelines deployed on Czech clinical notes.

> Robustness in deep neural networks and machine learning algorithms in general is an open research challenge. In particular, it is difficult to ensure algorithmic performance is maintained on out-of-distribution inputs or anomalous instances that cannot be anticipated at training time. Embodied agents will be deployed in these conditions, and are likely to make incorrect predictions. An agent will be viewed as untrustworthy unless it can maintain its performance in dynamic environments. Most robust training techniques aim to improve model accuracy on perturbed inputs; as an alternate form of robustness, we aim to reduce the severity of mistakes made by neural networks in challenging conditions. We leverage current adversarial training methods to generate targeted adversarial attacks during the training process in order to increase the semantic similarity between a model's predictions and true labels of misclassified instances. Results demonstrate that our approach performs better with respect to mistake severity compared to standard and adversarially trained models. We also find an intriguing role that non-robust features play with regards to semantic similarity.

> Images of spacecraft photographed from other spacecraft operating in outer space are difficult to come by, especially at a scale typically required for deep learning tasks. Semantic image segmentation, object detection and localization, and pose estimation are well researched areas with powerful results for many applications, and would be very useful in autonomous spacecraft operation and rendezvous. However, recent studies show that these strong results in broad and common domains may generalize poorly even to specific industrial applications on earth. To address this, we propose a method for generating synthetic image data that are labelled for semantic segmentation, generalizable to other tasks, and provide a prototype synthetic image dataset consisting of 2D monocular images of unmanned spacecraft, in order to enable further research in the area of autonomous spacecraft rendezvous. We also present a strong benchmark result (S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient 0.8723) on these synthetic data, suggesting that it is feasible to train well-performing image segmentation models for this task, especially if the target spacecraft and its configuration are known.

> Research on text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress in generating diverse and photo-realistic images, driven by diffusion and auto-regressive models trained on large-scale image-text data. Though state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities, they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as `Chortai (dog)' or `Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images, even for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an external multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs and uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step, Re-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of high-level semantics and low-level visual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in generating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a constructed dataset containing (image, text, retrieval) triples to teach the model to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a new sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and retrieval conditions to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen achieves significant gain on FID score over COCO and WikiImage. To further evaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new benchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent to rare, across multiple object categories including dogs, foods, landmarks, birds, and characters. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen can significantly improve the fidelity of generated images, especially on less frequent entities.

> There has been a significant increase in the adoption of technology in cricket recently. This trend has created the problem of duplicate work being done in similar computer vision-based research works. Our research tries to solve one of these problems by segmenting ball deliveries in a cricket broadcast using deep learning models, MobileNet and YOLO, thus enabling researchers to use our work as a dataset for their research. The output from our research can be used by cricket coaches and players to analyze ball deliveries which are played during the match. This paper presents an approach to segment and extract video shots in which only the ball is being delivered. The video shots are a series of continuous frames that make up the whole scene of the video. Object detection models are applied to reach a high level of accuracy in terms of correctly extracting video shots. The proof of concept for building large datasets of video shots for ball deliveries is proposed which paves the way for further processing on those shots for the extraction of semantics. Ball tracking in these video shots is also done using a separate RetinaNet model as a sample of the usefulness of the proposed dataset. The position on the cricket pitch where the ball lands is also extracted by tracking the ball along the y-axis. The video shot is then classified as a full-pitched, good-length or short-pitched delivery.

> Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) is a popular location-based service that helps people to order what you want. Compared with traditional e-commerce recommendation systems, users' interests may be diverse under different spatiotemporal contexts, leading to various spatiotemporal data distribution, which limits the fitting capacity of the model. However, numerous current works simply mix all samples to train a set of model parameters, which makes it difficult to capture the diversity in different spatiotemporal contexts. Therefore, we address this challenge by proposing a Bottom-up Adaptive Spatiotemporal Model(BASM) to adaptively fit the spatiotemporal data distribution, which further improve the fitting capability of the model. Specifically, a spatiotemporal-aware embedding layer performs weight adaptation on field granularity in feature embedding, to achieve the purpose of dynamically perceiving spatiotemporal contexts. Meanwhile, we propose a spatiotemporal semantic transformation layer to explicitly convert the concatenated input of the raw semantic to spatiotemporal semantic, which can further enhance the semantic representation under different spatiotemporal contexts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel spatiotemporal adaptive bias tower to capture diverse spatiotemporal bias, reducing the difficulty to model spatiotemporal distinction. To further verify the effectiveness of BASM, we also novelly propose two new metrics, Time-period-wise AUC (TAUC) and City-wise AUC (CAUC). Extensive offline evaluations on public and industrial datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modle. The online A/B experiment also further illustrates the practicability of the model online service. This proposed method has now been implemented on the Ele.me, a major online food ordering platform in China, serving more than 100 million online users.

> Code-switching poses a number of challenges and opportunities for multilingual automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we focus on the question of robust and fair evaluation metrics. To that end, we develop a reference benchmark data set of code-switching speech recognition hypotheses with human judgments. We define clear guidelines for minimal editing of automatic hypotheses. We validate the guidelines using 4-way inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate a large number of metrics in terms of correlation with human judgments. The metrics we consider vary in terms of representation (orthographic, phonological, semantic), directness (intrinsic vs extrinsic), granularity (e.g. word, character), and similarity computation method. The highest correlation to human judgment is achieved using transliteration followed by text normalization. We release the first corpus for human acceptance of code-switching speech recognition results in dialectal Arabic/English conversation speech.

> Multi-Intent Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), a novel and more complex scenario of SLU, is attracting increasing attention. Unlike traditional SLU, each intent in this scenario has its specific scope. Semantic information outside the scope even hinders the prediction, which tremendously increases the difficulty of intent detection. More seriously, guiding slot filling with these inaccurate intent labels suffers error propagation problems, resulting in unsatisfied overall performance. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Scope-Sensitive Result Attention Network (SSRAN) based on Transformer, which contains a Scope Recognizer (SR) and a Result Attention Network (RAN). Scope Recognizer assignments scope information to each token, reducing the distraction of out-of-scope tokens. Result Attention Network effectively utilizes the bidirectional interaction between results of slot filling and intent detection, mitigating the error propagation problem. Experiments on two public datasets indicate that our model significantly improves SLU performance (5.4\% and 2.1\% on Overall accuracy) over the state-of-the-art baseline.

> Mechanistic interpretability aims to explain what a neural network has learned at a nuts-and-bolts level. What are the fundamental primitives of neural network representations? Previous mechanistic descriptions have used individual neurons or their linear combinations to understand the representations a network has learned. But there are clues that neurons and their linear combinations are not the correct fundamental units of description: directions cannot describe how neural networks use nonlinearities to structure their representations. Moreover, many instances of individual neurons and their combinations are polysemantic (i.e. they have multiple unrelated meanings). Polysemanticity makes interpreting the network in terms of neurons or directions challenging since we can no longer assign a specific feature to a neural unit. In order to find a basic unit of description that does not suffer from these problems, we zoom in beyond just directions to study the way that piecewise linear activation functions (such as ReLU) partition the activation space into numerous discrete polytopes. We call this perspective the polytope lens. The polytope lens makes concrete predictions about the behavior of neural networks, which we evaluate through experiments on both convolutional image classifiers and language models. Specifically, we show that polytopes can be used to identify monosemantic regions of activation space (while directions are not in general monosemantic) and that the density of polytope boundaries reflect semantic boundaries. We also outline a vision for what mechanistic interpretability might look like through the polytope lens.

We address this problem as a sequence generation task by leveraging pre-trained sequence-to-sequence language models, e.g. BART. Given a sentence, we fine-tune such models to detect pairs of entity mentions and jointly generate a set of facts consisting of the full set of semantic annotations for a KG, such as entity labels, entity types, and their relationships. To showcase the capabilities of our tool, we build a web application consisting of a set of UI widgets that help users to navigate through the semantic data extracted from a given input text. We make the KnowGL model available at https://huggingface.co/ibm/knowgl-large.

> Large-scale text-to-image generative models have been a revolutionary breakthrough in the evolution of generative AI, allowing us to synthesize diverse images that convey highly complex visual concepts. However, a pivotal challenge in leveraging such models for real-world content creation tasks is providing users with control over the generated content. In this paper, we present a new framework that takes text-to-image synthesis to the realm of image-to-image translation -- given a guidance image and a target text prompt, our method harnesses the power of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate a new image that complies with the target text, while preserving the semantic layout of the source image. Specifically, we observe and empirically demonstrate that fine-grained control over the generated structure can be achieved by manipulating spatial features and their self-attention inside the model. This results in a simple and effective approach, where features extracted from the guidance image are directly injected into the generation process of the target image, requiring no training or fine-tuning and applicable for both real or generated guidance images. We demonstrate high-quality results on versatile text-guided image translation tasks, including translating sketches, rough drawings and animations into realistic images, changing of the class and appearance of objects in a given image, and modifications of global qualities such as lighting and color.

> Big streams of Earth images from satellites or other platforms (e.g., drones and mobile phones) are becoming increasingly available at low or no cost and with enhanced spatial and temporal resolution. This thesis recognizes the unprecedented opportunities offered by the high quality and open access Earth observation data of our times and introduces novel machine learning and big data methods to properly exploit them towards developing applications for sustainable and resilient agriculture. The thesis addresses three distinct thematic areas, i.e., the monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the monitoring of food security and applications for smart and resilient agriculture. The methodological innovations of the developments related to the three thematic areas address the following issues: i) the processing of big Earth Observation (EO) data, ii) the scarcity of annotated data for machine learning model training and iii) the gap between machine learning outputs and actionable advice.   This thesis demonstrated how big data technologies such as data cubes, distributed learning, linked open data and semantic enrichment can be used to exploit the data deluge and extract knowledge to address real user needs. Furthermore, this thesis argues for the importance of semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning models that circumvent the ever-present challenge of scarce annotations and thus allow for model generalization in space and time. Specifically, it is shown how merely few ground truth data are needed to generate high quality crop type maps and crop phenology estimations. Finally, this thesis argues there is considerable distance in value between model inferences and decision making in real-world scenarios and thereby showcases the power of causal and interpretable machine learning in bridging this gap.

Further adapting these models to specific languages, especially ones unseen during pre-training, is an important goal towards expanding the coverage of language technologies. In this study, we show how we can use language phylogenetic information to improve cross-lingual transfer leveraging closely related languages in a structured, linguistically-informed manner. We perform adapter-based training on languages from diverse language families (Germanic, Uralic, Tupian, Uto-Aztecan) and evaluate on both syntactic and semantic tasks, obtaining more than 20% relative performance improvements over strong commonly used baselines, especially on languages unseen during pre-training.

> Creating challenging tabular inference data is essential for learning complex reasoning. Prior work has mostly relied on two data generation strategies. The first is human annotation, which yields linguistically diverse data but is difficult to scale. The second category for creation is synthetic generation, which is scalable and cost effective but lacks inventiveness. In this research, we present a framework for semi-automatically recasting existing tabular data to make use of the benefits of both approaches. We utilize our framework to build tabular NLI instances from five datasets that were initially intended for tasks like table2text creation, tabular Q/A, and semantic parsing. We demonstrate that recasted data could be used as evaluation benchmarks as well as augmentation data to enhance performance on tabular NLI tasks. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of models trained on recasted data in the zero-shot scenario, and analyse trends in performance across different recasted datasets types.

> Neural decoding is still a challenge and hot topic in neurocomputing science. Recently, many studies have shown that brain network patterns containing rich spatial and temporal structure information, which represents the activation information of brain under external stimuli. %Therefore, the research of decoding stimuli from brain network received extensive more attention. The traditional method extracts brain network features directly from the common machine learning method, then puts these features into the classifier, and realizes to decode external stimuli. However, this method cannot effectively extract the multi-dimensional structural information, which is hidden in the brain network. The tensor researchers show that the tensor decomposition model can fully mine unique spatio-temporal structure characteristics in multi-dimensional structure data. This research proposed a stimulus constrained tensor brain model(STN)which involves the tensor decomposition idea and stimulus category constraint information. The model was verified on the real neuroimaging data sets (MEG and fMRI). The experimental results show that the STN model achieves more than 11.06% and 18.46% on accuracy matrix compared with others methods on two modal data sets. These results imply the superiority of extracting discriminative characteristics about STN model, especially for decoding object stimuli with semantic information.

> Multimodal models trained on large natural image-text pair datasets have exhibited astounding abilities in generating high-quality images. Medical imaging data is fundamentally different to natural images, and the language used to succinctly capture relevant details in medical data uses a different, narrow but semantically rich, domain-specific vocabulary. Not surprisingly, multi-modal models trained on natural image-text pairs do not tend to generalize well to the medical domain. Developing generative imaging models faithfully representing medical concepts while providing compositional diversity could mitigate the existing paucity of high-quality, annotated medical imaging datasets. In this work, we develop a strategy to overcome the large natural-medical distributional shift by adapting a pre-trained latent diffusion model on a corpus of publicly available chest x-rays (CXR) and their corresponding radiology (text) reports. We investigate the model's ability to generate high-fidelity, diverse synthetic CXR conditioned on text prompts. We assess the model outputs quantitatively using image quality metrics, and evaluate image quality and text-image alignment by human domain experts. We present evidence that the resulting model (RoentGen) is able to create visually convincing, diverse synthetic CXR images, and that the output can be controlled to a new extent by using free-form text prompts including radiology-specific language. Fine-tuning this model on a fixed training set and using it as a data augmentation method, we measure a 5% improvement of a classifier trained jointly on synthetic and real images, and a 3% improvement when trained on a larger but purely synthetic training set. Finally, we observe that this fine-tuning distills in-domain knowledge in the text-encoder and can improve its representation capabilities of certain diseases like pneumothorax by 25%.

Hence, ensuring proper, correct, robust, and trustworthy benchmarking is of utmost importance for the further development of the field. We believe that this can be achieved by adhering to the recently emerged data management standards, such as the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and TRUST (Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology) principles. To FAIRify the MLC datasets, we introduce an ontology-based online catalogue of MLC datasets that follow these principles. The catalogue extensively describes many MLC datasets with comprehensible meta-features, MLC-specific semantic descriptions, and different data provenance information. The MLC data catalogue is extensively described in our recent publication in Nature Scientific Reports, Kostovska & Bogatinovski et al., and available at: http://semantichub.ijs.si/MLCdatasets.

> To overcome the data sparsity issue in short text topic modeling, existing methods commonly rely on data augmentation or the data characteristic of short texts to introduce more word co-occurrence information. However, most of them do not make full use of the augmented data or the data characteristic: they insufficiently learn the relations among samples in data, leading to dissimilar topic distributions of semantically similar text pairs. To better address data sparsity, in this paper we propose a novel short text topic modeling framework, Topic-Semantic Contrastive Topic Model (TSCTM). To sufficiently model the relations among samples, we employ a new contrastive learning method with efficient positive and negative sampling strategies based on topic semantics. This contrastive learning method refines the representations, enriches the learning signals, and thus mitigates the sparsity issue. Extensive experimental results show that our TSCTM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines regardless of the data augmentation availability, producing high-quality topics and topic distributions.

> Modeling spatial relationship in the data remains critical across many different tasks, such as image classification, semantic segmentation and protein structure understanding. Previous works often use a unified solution like relative positional encoding. However, there exists different kinds of spatial relations, including short-range, medium-range and long-range relations, and modeling them separately can better capture the focus of different tasks on the multi-range relations (e.g., short-range relations can be important in instance segmentation, while long-range relations should be upweighted for semantic segmentation). In this work, we introduce the EurNet for Efficient multi-range relational modeling. EurNet constructs the multi-relational graph, where each type of edge corresponds to short-, medium- or long-range spatial interactions. In the constructed graph, EurNet adopts a novel modeling layer, called gated relational message passing (GRMP), to propagate multi-relational information across the data. GRMP captures multiple relations within the data with little extra computational cost. We study EurNets in two important domains for image and protein structure modeling. Extensive experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation verify the gains of EurNet over the previous SoTA FocalNet. On the EC and GO protein function prediction benchmarks, EurNet consistently surpasses the previous SoTA GearNet. Our results demonstrate the strength of EurNets on modeling spatial multi-relational data from various domains. The implementations of EurNet for image modeling are available at https://github.com/hirl-team/EurNet-Image . The implementations for other applied domains/tasks will be released soon.

> Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity towards a specific aspect in the given sentence. While pre-trained language models such as BERT have achieved great success, incorporating dynamic semantic changes into ABSA remains challenging. To this end, in this paper, we propose to address this problem by Dynamic Re-weighting BERT (DR-BERT), a novel method designed to learn dynamic aspect-oriented semantics for ABSA. Specifically, we first take the Stack-BERT layers as a primary encoder to grasp the overall semantic of the sentence and then fine-tune it by incorporating a lightweight Dynamic Re-weighting Adapter (DRA). Note that the DRA can pay close attention to a small region of the sentences at each step and re-weigh the vitally important words for better aspect-aware sentiment understanding. Finally, experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the rationality of our proposed model and provide good interpretable insights for future semantic modeling.

> Self-Supervised Video Hashing (SSVH) models learn to generate short binary representations for videos without ground-truth supervision, facilitating large-scale video retrieval efficiency and attracting increasing research attention. The success of SSVH lies in the understanding of video content and the ability to capture the semantic relation among unlabeled videos. Typically, state-of-the-art SSVH methods consider these two points in a two-stage training pipeline, where they firstly train an auxiliary network by instance-wise mask-and-predict tasks and secondly train a hashing model to preserve the pseudo-neighborhood structure transferred from the auxiliary network. This consecutive training strategy is inflexible and also unnecessary. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective one-stage SSVH method called ConMH, which incorporates video semantic information and video similarity relationship understanding in a single stage. To capture video semantic information for better hashing learning, we adopt an encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct the video from its temporal-masked frames. Particularly, we find that a higher masking ratio helps video understanding. Besides, we fully exploit the similarity relationship between videos by maximizing agreement between two augmented views of a video, which contributes to more discriminative and robust hash codes. Extensive experiments on three large-scale video datasets (i.e., FCVID, ActivityNet and YFCC) indicate that ConMH achieves state-of-the-art results.

> Software vulnerabilities can pose severe harms to a computing system. They can lead to system crash, privacy leakage, or even physical damage. Correctly identifying vulnerabilities among enormous software codes in a timely manner is so far the essential prerequisite to patch them. Unfortantely, the current vulnerability identification methods, either the classic ones or the deep-learning-based ones, have several critical drawbacks, making them unable to meet the present-day demands put forward by the software industry. To overcome the drawbacks, in this paper, we propose DeepVulSeeker, a novel fully automated vulnerability identification framework, which leverages both code graph structures and the semantic features with the help of the recently advanced Graph Representation Self-Attention and pre-training mechanisms. Our experiments show that DeepVulSeeker not only reaches an accuracy as high as 0.99 on traditional CWE datasets, but also outperforms all other exisiting methods on two highly-complicated datasets. We also testified DeepVulSeeker based on three case studies, and found that DeepVulSeeker is able to understand the implications of the vulnerbilities. We have fully implemented DeepVulSeeker and open-sourced it for future follow-up research.

> In the prompt-specific holistic score prediction task for Automatic Essay Scoring, the general approaches include pre-trained neural model, coherence model, and hybrid model that incorporate syntactic features with neural model. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract and represent essay coherence features with prompt-learning NSP that shows to match the state-of-the-art AES coherence model, and achieves the best performance for long essays. We apply syntactic feature dense embedding to augment BERT-based model and achieve the best performance for hybrid methodology for AES. In addition, we explore various ideas to combine coherence, syntactic information and semantic embeddings, which no previous study has done before. Our combined model also performs better than the SOTA available for combined model, even though it does not outperform our syntactic enhanced neural model. We further offer analyses that can be useful for future study.

> We present a simple and yet effective interpolation-based regularization technique, aiming to improve the generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on supervised graph classification. We leverage Mixup, an effective regularizer for vision, where random sample pairs and their labels are interpolated to create synthetic images for training. Unlike images with grid-like coordinates, graphs have arbitrary structure and topology, which can be very sensitive to any modification that alters the graph's semantic meanings. This posts two unanswered questions for Mixup-like regularization schemes: Can we directly mix up a pair of graph inputs? If so, how well does such mixing strategy regularize the learning of GNNs? To answer these two questions, we propose ifMixup, which first adds dummy nodes to make two graphs have the same input size and then simultaneously performs linear interpolation between the aligned node feature vectors and the aligned edge representations of the two graphs. We empirically show that such simple mixing schema can effectively regularize the classification learning, resulting in superior predictive accuracy to popular graph augmentation and GNN methods.

> Despite achieving promising results in a breadth of medical image segmentation tasks, deep neural networks require large training datasets with pixel-wise annotations. Obtaining these curated datasets is a cumbersome process which limits the applicability in scenarios. Mixed supervision is an appealing alternative for mitigating this obstacle. In this work, we propose a dual-branch architecture, where the upper branch (teacher) receives strong annotations, while the bottom one (student) is driven by limited supervision and guided by the upper branch. Combined with a standard cross-entropy loss over the labeled pixels, our novel formulation integrates two important terms: (i) a Shannon entropy loss defined over the less-supervised images, which encourages confident student predictions in the bottom branch; and (ii) a KL divergence term, which transfers the knowledge (i.e., predictions) of the strongly supervised branch to the less-supervised branch and guides the entropy (student-confidence) term to avoid trivial solutions. We show that the synergy between the entropy and KL divergence yields substantial improvements in performance. We also discuss an interesting link between Shannon-entropy minimization and standard pseudo-mask generation, and argue that the former should be preferred over the latter for leveraging information from unlabeled pixels. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments using two publicly available datasets. Results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other strategies for semantic segmentation within a mixed-supervision framework, as well as recent semi-supervised approaches. Our code is publicly available: https://github.com/by-liu/ConfKD.

> Recognizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for machine learning systems deployed in the open world. The vast majority of OOD detection methods are driven by a single modality (e.g., either vision or language), leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of OOD detection from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Maximum Concept Matching (MCM), a simple yet effective zero-shot OOD detection method based on aligning visual features with textual concepts. We contribute in-depth analysis and theoretical insights to understand the effectiveness of MCM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCM achieves superior performance on a wide variety of real-world tasks. MCM with vision-language features outperforms a common baseline with pure visual features on a hard OOD task with semantically similar classes by 13.1% (AUROC).

> Chest X-ray is one of the most popular medical imaging modalities due to its accessibility and effectiveness. However, there is a chronic shortage of well-trained radiologists who can interpret these images and diagnose the patient's condition. Therefore, automated radiology report generation can be a very helpful tool in clinical practice. A typical report generation workflow consists of two main steps: (i) encoding the image into a latent space and (ii) generating the text of the report based on the latent image embedding. Many existing report generation techniques use a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image encoding followed by a Transformer-based decoder for medical text generation. In most cases, CNN and the decoder are trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion. In this work, we primarily focus on understanding the relative importance of encoder and decoder components. Towards this end, we analyze four different image encoding approaches: direct, fine-grained, CLIP-based, and Cluster-CLIP-based encodings in conjunction with three different decoders on the large-scale MIMIC-CXR dataset. Among these encoders, the cluster CLIP visual encoder is a novel approach that aims to generate more discriminative and explainable representations. CLIP-based encoders produce comparable results to traditional CNN-based encoders in terms of NLP metrics, while fine-grained encoding outperforms all other encoders both in terms of NLP and clinical accuracy metrics, thereby validating the importance of image encoder to effectively extract semantic information.

> Visual search is a ubiquitous challenge in natural vision, including daily tasks such as finding a friend in a crowd or searching for a car in a parking lot. Human rely heavily on relevant target features to perform goal-directed visual search. Meanwhile, context is of critical importance for locating a target object in complex scenes as it helps narrow down the search area and makes the search process more efficient. However, few works have combined both target and context information in visual search computational models. Here we propose a zero-shot deep learning architecture, TCT (Target and Context-aware Transformer), that modulates self attention in the Vision Transformer with target and contextual relevant information to enable human-like zero-shot visual search performance. Target modulation is computed as patch-wise local relevance between the target and search images, whereas contextual modulation is applied in a global fashion. We conduct visual search experiments on TCT and other competitive visual search models on three natural scene datasets with varying levels of difficulty. TCT demonstrates human-like performance in terms of search efficiency and beats the SOTA models in challenging visual search tasks. Importantly, TCT generalizes well across datasets with novel objects without retraining or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we also introduce a new dataset to benchmark models for invariant visual search under incongruent contexts. TCT manages to search flexibly via target and context modulation, even under incongruent contexts.

> Semantic role labeling (SRL) focuses on recognizing the predicate-argument structure of a sentence and plays a critical role in many natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and question answering. Practically all available methods do not perform full SRL, since they rely on pre-identified predicates, and most of them follow a pipeline strategy, using specific models for undertaking one or several SRL subtasks. In addition, previous approaches have a strong dependence on syntactic information to achieve state-of-the-art performance, despite being syntactic trees equally hard to produce. These simplifications and requirements make the majority of SRL systems impractical for real-world applications. In this article, we propose the first transition-based SRL approach that is capable of completely processing an input sentence in a single left-to-right pass, with neither leveraging syntactic information nor resorting to additional modules. Thanks to our implementation based on Pointer Networks, full SRL can be accurately and efficiently done in $O(n^2)$, achieving the best performance to date on the majority of languages from the CoNLL-2009 shared task.

> Representing relevant information of a traffic scene and understanding its environment is crucial for the success of autonomous driving. Modeling the surrounding of an autonomous car using semantic relations, i.e., how different traffic participants relate in the context of traffic rule based behaviors, is hardly been considered in previous work. This stems from the fact that these relations are hard to extract from real-world traffic scenes. In this work, we model traffic scenes in a form of spatial semantic scene graphs for various different predictions about the traffic participants, e.g., acceleration and deceleration. Our learning and inference approach uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and shows that incorporating explicit information about the spatial semantic relations between traffic participants improves the predicdtion results. Specifically, the acceleration prediction of traffic participants is improved by up to 12% compared to the baselines, which do not exploit this explicit information. Furthermore, by including additional information about previous scenes, we achieve 73% improvements.

> Online learning platforms provide learning materials and answers to students' academic questions by experts, peers, or systems. This paper explores question-type identification as a step in content understanding for an online learning platform. The aim of the question-type identifier is to categorize question types based on their structure and complexity, using the question text, subject, and structural features. We have defined twelve question-type classes, including Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ), essay, and others. We have compiled an internal dataset of students' questions and used a combination of weak-supervision techniques and manual annotation. We then trained a BERT-based ensemble model on this dataset and evaluated this model on a separate human-labeled test set. Our experiments yielded an F1-score of 0.94 for MCQ binary classification and promising results for 12-class multilabel classification. We deployed the model in our online learning platform as a crucial enabler for content understanding to enhance the student learning experience.

> This paper embarks upon exploration of quantum vulnerability analysis. By introducing vulnerability graphs, related to attack graphs, this paper provides background theory and a subsequent method for solving significant cybersecurity problems with quantum computing. The example given is to prioritize patches by expressing the connectivity of various vulnerabilities on a network with a QUBO and then solving this with quantum annealing. Such a solution is then proved to remove all kill-chains (paths to security compromise) on a network. The results demonstrate that the quantum computer's solve time is almost constant compared to the exponential increase in classical solve time for vulnerability graphs of expected real world density. As such, this paper presents a novel example of advantageous quantum vulnerability analysis.

> Recent works have shown that joint source-channel coding (JSCC) schemes using deep neural networks (DNNs), called DeepJSCC, provide promising results in wireless image transmission. However, these methods mostly focus on the distortion of the reconstructed signals with respect to the input image, rather than their perception by humans. However, focusing on traditional distortion metrics alone does not necessarily result in high perceptual quality, especially in extreme physical conditions, such as very low bandwidth compression ratio (BCR) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. In this work, we propose two novel JSCC schemes that leverage the perceptual quality of deep generative models (DGMs) for wireless image transmission, namely InverseJSCC and GenerativeJSCC. While the former is an inverse problem approach to DeepJSCC, the latter is an end-to-end optimized JSCC scheme. In both, we optimize a weighted sum of mean squared error (MSE) and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) losses, which capture more semantic similarities than other distortion metrics. InverseJSCC performs denoising on the distorted reconstructions of a DeepJSCC model by solving an inverse optimization problem using style-based generative adversarial network (StyleGAN). Our simulation results show that InverseJSCC significantly improves the state-of-the-art (SotA) DeepJSCC in terms of perceptual quality in edge cases. In GenerativeJSCC, we carry out end-to-end training of an encoder and a StyleGAN-based decoder, and show that GenerativeJSCC significantly outperforms DeepJSCC both in terms of distortion and perceptual quality.

> Examining graphs for similarity is a well-known challenge, but one that is mandatory for grouping graphs together. We present a data-driven method to cluster traffic scenes that is self-supervised, i.e. without manual labelling. We leverage the semantic scene graph model to create a generic graph embedding of the traffic scene, which is then mapped to a low-dimensional embedding space using a Siamese network, in which clustering is performed. In the training process of our novel approach, we augment existing traffic scenes in the Cartesian space to generate positive similarity samples. This allows us to overcome the challenge of reconstructing a graph and at the same time obtain a representation to describe the similarity of traffic scenes. We could show, that the resulting clusters possess common semantic characteristics. The approach was evaluated on the INTERACTION dataset.

> Neural machine translation (NMT) is often criticized for failures that happen without awareness. The lack of competency awareness makes NMT untrustworthy. This is in sharp contrast to human translators who give feedback or conduct further investigations whenever they are in doubt about predictions. To fill this gap, we propose a novel competency-aware NMT by extending conventional NMT with a self-estimator, offering abilities to translate a source sentence and estimate its competency. The self-estimator encodes the information of the decoding procedure and then examines whether it can reconstruct the original semantics of the source sentence. Experimental results on four translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method not only carries out translation tasks intact but also delivers outstanding performance on quality estimation. Without depending on any reference or annotated data typically required by state-of-the-art metric and quality estimation methods, our model yields an even higher correlation with human quality judgments than a variety of aforementioned methods, such as BLEURT, COMET, and BERTScore. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show better robustness of competency awareness in our model.

> Recently, text-guided image manipulation has received increasing attention in the research field of multimedia processing and computer vision due to its high flexibility and controllability. Its goal is to semantically manipulate parts of an input reference image according to the text descriptions. However, most of the existing works have the following problems: (1) text-irrelevant content cannot always be maintained but randomly changed, (2) the performance of image manipulation still needs to be further improved, (3) only can manipulate descriptive attributes. To solve these problems, we propose a novel image manipulation method that interactively edits an image using complex text instructions. It allows users to not only improve the accuracy of image manipulation but also achieve complex tasks such as enlarging, dwindling, or removing objects and replacing the background with the input image. To make these tasks possible, we apply three strategies. First, the given image is divided into text-relevant content and text-irrelevant content. Only the text-relevant content is manipulated and the text-irrelevant content can be maintained. Second, a super-resolution method is used to enlarge the manipulation region to further improve the operability and to help manipulate the object itself. Third, a user interface is introduced for editing the segmentation map interactively to re-modify the generated image according to the user's desires. Extensive experiments on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB) dataset and Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) datasets demonstrate our proposed method can enable interactive, flexible, and accurate image manipulation in real-time. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

> Latent semantic analysis (LSA) and correspondence analysis (CA) are two techniques that use a singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction. LSA has been extensively used to obtain low-dimensional representations that capture relationships among documents and terms. In this article, we present a theoretical analysis and comparison of the two techniques in the context of document-term matrices. We show that CA has some attractive properties as compared to LSA, for instance that effects of margins, i.e. sums of row elements and column elements, arising from differing document-lengths and term-frequencies are effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is optimally suited to focus on relationships among documents and terms. A unifying framework is proposed that includes both CA and LSA as special cases. We empirically compare CA to various LSA based methods on text categorization in English and authorship attribution on historical Dutch texts, and find that CA performs significantly better. We also apply CA to a long-standing question regarding the authorship of the Dutch national anthem Wilhelmus and provide further support that it can be attributed to the author Datheen, amongst several contenders.

> Domain generalization is the task of learning models that generalize to unseen target domains. We propose a simple yet effective method for domain generalization, named cross-domain ensemble distillation (XDED), that learns domain-invariant features while encouraging the model to converge to flat minima, which recently turned out to be a sufficient condition for domain generalization. To this end, our method generates an ensemble of the output logits from training data with the same label but from different domains and then penalizes each output for the mismatch with the ensemble. Also, we present a de-stylization technique that standardizes features to encourage the model to produce style-consistent predictions even in an arbitrary target domain. Our method greatly improves generalization capability in public benchmarks for cross-domain image classification, cross-dataset person re-ID, and cross-dataset semantic segmentation. Moreover, we show that models learned by our method are robust against adversarial attacks and image corruptions.

The motivation behind this paper's experiment was that LayoutLMv3's official paper had no results for table detection using semantic information. We concluded that our approach did not improve the model's table detection capabilities, for which we can give several possible reasons. Either the model's weights were unsuitable for our purpose, or we needed to invest more time in optimising the model's hyperparameters. It is also possible that semantic information does not improve a model's table detection accuracy.

> Semantic communication is viewed as a revolutionary paradigm that can potentially transform how we design and operate wireless communication systems. However, despite a recent surge of research activities in this area, the research landscape remains limited. In this tutorial, we present the first rigorous vision of a scalable end-to-end semantic communication network that is founded on novel concepts from artificial intelligence (AI), causal reasoning, and communication theory. We first discuss how the design of semantic communication networks requires a move from data-driven networks towards knowledge-driven ones. Subsequently, we highlight the necessity of creating semantic representations of data that satisfy the key properties of minimalism, generalizability, and efficiency so as to do more with less. We then explain how those representations can form the basis a so-called semantic language. By using semantic representation and languages, we show that the traditional transmitter and receiver now become a teacher and apprentice. Then, we define the concept of reasoning by investigating the fundamentals of causal representation learning and their role in designing semantic communication networks. We demonstrate that reasoning faculties are majorly characterized by the ability to capture causal and associational relationships in datastreams. For such reasoning-driven networks, we propose novel and essential semantic communication metrics that include new "reasoning capacity" measures that could go beyond Shannon's bound to capture the convergence of computing and communication. Finally, we explain how semantic communications can be scaled to large-scale networks (6G and beyond). In a nutshell, we expect this tutorial to provide a comprehensive reference on how to properly build, analyze, and deploy future semantic communication networks.

> Media news are making a large part of public opinion and, therefore, must not be fake. News on web sites, blogs, and social media must be analyzed before being published. In this paper, we present linguistic characteristics of media news items to differentiate between fake news and real news using machine learning algorithms. Neural fake news generation, headlines created by machines, semantic incongruities in text and image captions generated by machine are other types of fake news problems. These problems use neural networks which mainly control distributional features rather than evidence. We propose applying correlation between features set and class, and correlation among the features to compute correlation attribute evaluation metric and covariance metric to compute variance of attributes over the news items. Features unique, negative, positive, and cardinal numbers with high values on the metrics are observed to provide a high area under the curve (AUC) and F1-score.

- `2211.14508v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14508v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14508v1)

> Recently, semantic parsing using hierarchical representations for dialog systems has captured substantial attention. Task-Oriented Parse (TOP), a tree representation with intents and slots as labels of nested tree nodes, has been proposed for parsing user utterances. Previous TOP parsing methods are limited on tackling unseen dynamic slot values (e.g., new songs and locations added), which is an urgent matter for real dialog systems. To mitigate this issue, we first propose a novel span-splitting representation for span-based parser that outperforms existing methods. Then we present a novel lexicon-injected semantic parser, which collects slot labels of tree representation as a lexicon, and injects lexical features to the span representation of parser. An additional slot disambiguation technique is involved to remove inappropriate span match occurrences from the lexicon. Our best parser produces a new state-of-the-art result (87.62%) on the TOP dataset, and demonstrates its adaptability to frequently updated slot lexicon entries in real task-oriented dialog, with no need of retraining.

> Recent works in autonomous driving have widely adopted the bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic map as an intermediate representation of the world. Online prediction of these BEV maps involves non-trivial operations such as multi-camera data extraction as well as fusion and projection into a common topview grid. This is usually done with error-prone geometric operations (e.g., homography or back-projection from monocular depth estimation) or expensive direct dense mapping between image pixels and pixels in BEV (e.g., with MLP or attention). In this work, we present 'LaRa', an efficient encoder-decoder, transformer-based model for vehicle semantic segmentation from multiple cameras. Our approach uses a system of cross-attention to aggregate information over multiple sensors into a compact, yet rich, collection of latent representations. These latent representations, after being processed by a series of self-attention blocks, are then reprojected with a second cross-attention in the BEV space. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the best previous works using transformers on nuScenes. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/LaRa

> The Visual Domain Adaptation(VisDA) 2022 Challenge calls for an unsupervised domain adaptive model in semantic segmentation tasks for industrial waste sorting. In this paper, we introduce the SIA_Adapt method, which incorporates several methods for domain adaptive models. The core of our method in the transferable representation from large-scale pre-training. In this process, we choose a network architecture that differs from the state-of-the-art for domain adaptation. After that, self-training using pseudo-labels helps to make the initial adaptation model more adaptable to the target domain. Finally, the model soup scheme helped to improve the generalization performance in the target domain. Our method SIA_Adapt achieves 1st place in the VisDA2022 challenge.

- *Chao Li, Hao Xu, Kun He*

- `2211.14752v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14752v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14752v1)

> Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are widely employed for describing real-world data with intricate entities and relationships. To automatically utilize their semantic information, graph neural architecture search has recently been developed on various tasks of HINs. Existing works, on the other hand, show weaknesses in instability and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Partial Message Meta Multigraph search (PMMM) to automatically optimize the neural architecture design on HINs. Specifically, to learn how graph neural networks (GNNs) propagate messages along various types of edges, PMMM adopts an efficient differentiable framework to search for a meaningful meta multigraph, which can capture more flexible and complex semantic relations than a meta graph. The differentiable search typically suffers from performance instability, so we further propose a stable algorithm called partial message search to ensure that the searched meta multigraph consistently surpasses the manually designed meta-structures, i.e., meta-paths. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets over two representative tasks, including node classification and recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art heterogeneous GNNs, finds out meaningful meta multigraphs, and is significantly more stable.

> Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge to the student model by utilizing the predictions/features of the teacher model, and feature-based distillation has recently shown its superiority over logit-based distillation. However, due to the cumbersome computation and storage of extra feature transformation, the training overhead of feature-based methods is much higher than that of logit-based distillation. In this work, we revisit the logit-based knowledge distillation, and observe that the existing logit-based distillation methods treat the prediction logits only in the instance level, while many other useful semantic information is overlooked. To address this issue, we propose a Class-aware Logit Knowledge Distillation (CLKD) method, that extents the logit distillation in both instance-level and class-level. CLKD enables the student model mimic higher semantic information from the teacher model, hence improving the distillation performance. We further introduce a novel loss called Class Correlation Loss to force the student learn the inherent class-level correlation of the teacher. Empirical comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several prevailing logit-based methods and feature-based methods, in which CLKD achieves compelling results on various visual classification tasks and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

> One of the innovations brought by Mirai and its derived malware is the adoption of self-contained loaders for infecting IoT devices and recruiting them in botnets. Functionally decoupled from other botnet components and not embedded in the payload, loaders cannot be analysed using conventional approaches that rely on honeypots for capturing samples. Different approaches are necessary for studying the loaders evolution and defining a genealogy. To address the insufficient knowledge about loaders' lineage in existing studies, in this paper, we propose a semantic-aware method to measure, categorize, and compare different loader servers, with the goal of highlighting their evolution, independent from the payload evolution. Leveraging behavior-based metrics, we cluster the discovered loaders and define eight families to determine the genealogy and draw a homology map. Our study shows that the source code of Mirai is evolving and spawning new botnets with new capabilities, both on the client side and the server side. In turn, shedding light on the infection loaders can help the cybersecurity community to improve detection and prevention tools.

> Opinion summarisation synthesises opinions expressed in a group of documents discussing the same topic to produce a single summary. Recent work has looked at opinion summarisation of clusters of social media posts. Such posts are noisy and have unpredictable structure, posing additional challenges for the construction of the summary distribution and the preservation of meaning compared to online reviews, which has been so far the focus of opinion summarisation. To address these challenges we present \textit{WassOS}, an unsupervised abstractive summarization model which makes use of the Wasserstein distance. A Variational Autoencoder is used to get the distribution of documents/posts, and the distributions are disentangled into separate semantic and syntactic spaces. The summary distribution is obtained using the Wasserstein barycenter of the semantic and syntactic distributions. A latent variable sampled from the summary distribution is fed into a GRU decoder with a transformer layer to produce the final summary. Our experiments on multiple datasets including Twitter clusters, Reddit threads, and reviews show that WassOS almost always outperforms the state-of-the-art on ROUGE metrics and consistently produces the best summaries with respect to meaning preservation according to human evaluations.

> Accurate localization ability is fundamental in autonomous driving. Traditional visual localization frameworks approach the semantic map-matching problem with geometric models, which rely on complex parameter tuning and thus hinder large-scale deployment. In this paper, we propose BEV-Locator: an end-to-end visual semantic localization neural network using multi-view camera images. Specifically, a visual BEV (Birds-Eye-View) encoder extracts and flattens the multi-view images into BEV space. While the semantic map features are structurally embedded as map queries sequence. Then a cross-model transformer associates the BEV features and semantic map queries. The localization information of ego-car is recursively queried out by cross-attention modules. Finally, the ego pose can be inferred by decoding the transformer outputs. We evaluate the proposed method in large-scale nuScenes and Qcraft datasets. The experimental results show that the BEV-locator is capable to estimate the vehicle poses under versatile scenarios, which effectively associates the cross-model information from multi-view images and global semantic maps. The experiments report satisfactory accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.052m, 0.135m and 0.251$^\circ$ in lateral, longitudinal translation and heading angle degree.

> Breaking down a document or a conversation into multiple contiguous segments based on its semantic structure is an important and challenging problem in NLP, which can assist many downstream tasks. However, current works on topic segmentation often focus on segmentation of structured texts. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art topic segmentation models on unstructured texts. We find that: (a) Current strategies of pre-training on a large corpus of structured text such as Wiki-727K do not help in transferability to unstructured texts. (b) Training from scratch with only a relatively small-sized dataset of the target unstructured domain improves the segmentation results by a significant margin.

> Contemporary development projects benefit from code review as it improves the quality of a project. Large ecosystems of inter-dependent projects like OpenStack generate a large number of reviews, which poses new challenges for collaboration (improving patches, fixing defects). Review tools allow developers to link between patches, to indicate patch dependency, competing solutions, or provide broader context. We hypothesize that such patch linkage may also simulate cross-collaboration.   With a case study of OpenStack, we take a first step to explore collaborations that occur after a patch linkage was posted between two patches (i.e., cross-patch collaboration). Our empirical results show that although patch linkage that requests collaboration is relatively less prevalent, the probability of collaboration is relatively higher. Interestingly, the results also show that collaborative contributions via patch linkage are non-trivial, i.e, contributions can affect the review outcome (such as voting) or even improve the patch (i.e., revising). This work opens up future directions to understand barriers and opportunities related to this new kind of collaboration, that assists with code review and development tasks in large ecosystems.

> Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) focuses on enhancing text-only translation with visual features, which has attracted considerable attention from both natural language processing and computer vision communities. Recent advances still struggle to train a separate model for each language pair, which is costly and unaffordable when the number of languages increases in the real world. In other words, the multilingual multimodal machine translation (Multilingual MMT) task has not been investigated, which aims to handle the aforementioned issues by providing a shared semantic space for multiple languages. Besides, the image modality has no language boundaries, which is superior to bridging the semantic gap between languages. To this end, we first propose the Multilingual MMT task by establishing two new Multilingual MMT benchmark datasets covering seven languages. Then, an effective baseline LVP-M3 using visual prompts is proposed to support translations between different languages, which includes three stages (token encoding, language-aware visual prompt generation, and language translation). Extensive experimental results on our constructed benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LVP-M3 method for Multilingual MMT.

> In recent years, the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has achieved remarkable success, which is mainly due to the large amount of available annotation data. However, obtaining these annotated data has to afford expensive costs in reality. Therefore, a more realistic strategy is to leverage semi-supervised learning (SSL) with a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Typically, semantic consistency regularization and the two-stage learning methods of decoupling feature extraction and classification have been proven effective. Nevertheless, representation learning only limited to semantic consistency regularization may not guarantee the separation or discriminability of representations of samples with different semantics; due to the inherent limitations of the two-stage learning methods, the extracted features may not match the specific downstream tasks. In order to deal with the above drawbacks, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep semi-supervised learning double contrast of semantic and feature, which extracts effective tasks specific discriminative features by contrasting the semantics/features of positive and negative augmented samples pairs. Moreover, we leverage information theory to explain the rationality of double contrast of semantics and features and slack mutual information to contrastive loss in a simpler way. Finally, the effectiveness of our method is verified in benchmark datasets.

> Deep metric learning (DML) aims to automatically construct task-specific distances or similarities of data, resulting in a low-dimensional representation. Several significant metric-learning methods have been proposed. Nonetheless, no approach guarantees the preservation of the ordinal nature of the original data in a low-dimensional space. Ordinal data are ubiquitous in real-world problems, such as the severity of symptoms in biomedical cases, production quality in manufacturing, rating level in businesses, and aging level in face recognition. This study proposes a novel angular triangle distance (ATD) and ordinal triplet network (OTD) to obtain an accurate and meaningful embedding space representation for ordinal data. The ATD projects the ordinal relation of data in the angular space, whereas the OTD learns its ordinal projection. We also demonstrated that our new distance measure satisfies the distance metric properties mathematically. The proposed method was assessed using real-world data with an ordinal nature, such as biomedical, facial, and hand-gestured images. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results show that our proposed method not only semantically preserves the ordinal nature but is also more accurate than existing DML models. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art ordinal metric learning method.

> Deep neural networks are susceptible to shortcut learning, using simple features to achieve low training loss without discovering essential semantic structure. Contrary to prior belief, we show that generative models alone are not sufficient to prevent shortcut learning, despite an incentive to recover a more comprehensive representation of the data than discriminative approaches. However, we observe that shortcuts are preferentially encoded with minimal information, a fact that generative models can exploit to mitigate shortcut learning. In particular, we propose Chroma-VAE, a two-pronged approach where a VAE classifier is initially trained to isolate the shortcut in a small latent subspace, allowing a secondary classifier to be trained on the complementary, shortcut-free latent subspace. In addition to demonstrating the efficacy of Chroma-VAE on benchmark and real-world shortcut learning tasks, our work highlights the potential for manipulating the latent space of generative classifiers to isolate or interpret specific correlations.

> Visual question answering (VQA) often requires an understanding of visual concepts and language semantics, which relies on external knowledge. Most existing methods exploit pre-trained language models or/and unstructured text, but the knowledge in these resources are often incomplete and noisy. Some other methods prefer to use knowledge graphs (KGs) which often have intensive structured knowledge, but the research is still quite preliminary. In this paper, we propose LaKo, a knowledge-driven VQA method via Late Knowledge-to-text Injection. To effectively incorporate an external KG, we transfer triples into textual format and propose a late injection mechanism for knowledge fusion. Finally we address VQA as a text generation task with an effective encoder-decoder paradigm, which achieves state-of-the-art results on OKVQA dataset.

> This paper presents new methods and results for recognising black-box program functions using hardware performance counters (HPC), where an investigator can invoke and measure function calls. Important use cases include analysing compiled libraries, e.g. static and dynamic link libraries, and trusted execution environment (TEE) applications. We develop a generic approach to classify a comprehensive set of hardware events, e.g. branch mis-predictions and instruction retirements, to recognise standard benchmarking and cryptographic library functions. This includes various signing, verification and hash functions, and ciphers in numerous modes of operation. Three architectures are evaluated using off-the-shelf Intel/X86-64, ARM, and RISC-V CPUs. Next, we show that several known CVE-numbered OpenSSL vulnerabilities can be detected using HPC differences between patched and unpatched library versions. Further, we demonstrate that standardised cryptographic functions within ARM TrustZone TEE applications can be recognised using non-secure world HPC measurements, applying to platforms that insecurely perturb the performance monitoring unit (PMU) during TEE execution. High accuracy was achieved in all cases (86.22-99.83%) depending on the application, architectural, and compilation assumptions. Lastly, we discuss mitigations, outstanding challenges, and directions for future research.

> Personal knowledge bases (PKBs) are crucial for a broad range of applications such as personalized recommendation and Web-based chatbots. A critical challenge to build PKBs is extracting personal attribute knowledge from users' conversation data. Given some users of a conversational system, a personal attribute and these users' utterances, our goal is to predict the ranking of the given personal attribute values for each user. Previous studies often rely on a relative number of resources such as labeled utterances and external data, yet the attribute knowledge embedded in unlabeled utterances is underutilized and their performance of predicting some difficult personal attributes is still unsatisfactory. In addition, it is found that some text classification methods could be employed to resolve this task directly. However, they also perform not well over those difficult personal attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework PEARL to predict personal attributes from conversations by leveraging the abundant personal attribute knowledge from utterances under a low-resource setting in which no labeled utterances or external data are utilized. PEARL combines the biterm semantic information with the word co-occurrence information seamlessly via employing the updated prior attribute knowledge to refine the biterm topic model's Gibbs sampling process in an iterative manner. The extensive experimental results show that PEARL outperforms all the baseline methods not only on the task of personal attribute prediction from conversations over two data sets, but also on the more general weakly supervised text classification task over one data set.

> Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) aims to generate structured semantic summaries of images for "human-like" event understanding. Specifically, GSR task not only detects the salient activity verb (e.g. buying), but also predicts all corresponding semantic roles (e.g. agent and goods). Inspired by object detection and image captioning tasks, existing methods typically employ a two-stage framework: 1) detect the activity verb, and then 2) predict semantic roles based on the detected verb. Obviously, this illogical framework constitutes a huge obstacle to semantic understanding. First, pre-detecting verbs solely without semantic roles inevitably fails to distinguish many similar daily activities (e.g., offering and giving, buying and selling). Second, predicting semantic roles in a closed auto-regressive manner can hardly exploit the semantic relations among the verb and roles. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel two-stage framework that focuses on utilizing such bidirectional relations within verbs and roles. In the first stage, instead of pre-detecting the verb, we postpone the detection step and assume a pseudo label, where an intermediate representation for each corresponding semantic role is learned from images. In the second stage, we exploit transformer layers to unearth the potential semantic relations within both verbs and semantic roles. With the help of a set of support images, an alternate learning scheme is designed to simultaneously optimize the results: update the verb using nouns corresponding to the image, and update nouns using verbs from support images. Extensive experimental results on challenging SWiG benchmarks show that our renovated framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under various metrics.

> Manufacturers have been developing new graphics processing unit (GPU) nodes with large capacity, high bandwidth memory and very high bandwidth intra-node interconnects. This enables moving large amounts of data between GPUs on the same node at low cost. However, small packet bandwidths and latencies have not decreased which makes global dot products expensive. These characteristics favor a new kind of problem decomposition called "equation decomposition" rather than traditional domain decomposition. In this approach, each GPU is assigned one equation set to solve in parallel so that the frequent and expensive dot product synchronization points in traditional distributed linear solvers are eliminated. In exchange, the method involves infrequent movement of state variables over the high bandwidth, intra-node interconnects. To test this theory, our flagship code Multiphase Flow with Interphase eXchanges (MFiX) was ported to TensorFlow. This new product is known as MFiX-AI and can produce near identical results to the original version of MFiX with significant acceleration in multiphase particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) simulations. The performance of a single node with 4 NVIDIA A100s connected over NVLINK 2.0 was shown to be competitive to 1000 CPU cores (25 nodes) on the JOULE 2.0 supercomputer, leading to an energy savings of up to 90%. This is a substantial performance benefit for small- to intermediate-sized problems. This benefit is expected to grow as GPU nodes become more powerful. Further, MFiX-AI is poised to accept native artificial intelligence/machine learning models for further acceleration and development.

- *Kaustubh D. Dhole, Christopher D. Manning*

- `2004.08694v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08694v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08694v5)

> Question Generation (QG) is fundamentally a simple syntactic transformation; however, many aspects of semantics influence what questions are good to form. We implement this observation by developing SynQG, a set of transparent syntactic rules leveraging universal dependencies, shallow semantic parsing, lexical resources, and custom rules which transform declarative sentences into question-answer pairs. We utilize PropBank argument descriptions and VerbNet state predicates to incorporate shallow semantic content, which helps generate questions of a descriptive nature and produce inferential and semantically richer questions than existing systems. In order to improve syntactic fluency and eliminate grammatically incorrect questions, we employ back-translation over the output of these syntactic rules. A set of crowd-sourced evaluations shows that our system can generate a larger number of highly grammatical and relevant questions than previous QG systems and that back-translation drastically improves grammaticality at a slight cost of generating irrelevant questions.

> Over the recent twenty years, argumentation has received considerable attention in the fields of knowledge representation, reasoning, and multi-agent systems. However, argumentation in dynamic multi-agent systems encounters the problem of significant arguments generated by agents, which comes at the expense of representational complexity and computational cost. In this work, we aim to investigate the notion of abstraction from the model-checking perspective, where several arguments are trying to defend the same position from various points of view, thereby reducing the size of the argumentation framework whilst preserving the semantic flow structure in the system.

> To date, there are no effective treatments for most neurodegenerative diseases. Knowledge graphs can provide comprehensive and semantic representation for heterogeneous data, and have been successfully leveraged in many biomedical applications including drug repurposing. Our objective is to construct a knowledge graph from literature to study relations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chemicals, drugs and dietary supplements in order to identify opportunities to prevent or delay neurodegenerative progression. We collected biomedical annotations and extracted their relations using SemRep via SemMedDB. We used both a BERT-based classifier and rule-based methods during data preprocessing to exclude noise while preserving most AD-related semantic triples. The 1,672,110 filtered triples were used to train with knowledge graph completion algorithms (i.e., TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx) to predict candidates that might be helpful for AD treatment or prevention. Among three knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed the other two (MR = 13.45, Hits@1 = 0.306). We leveraged the time-slicing technique to further evaluate the prediction results. We found supporting evidence for most highly ranked candidates predicted by our model which indicates that our approach can inform reliable new knowledge. This paper shows that our graph mining model can predict reliable new relationships between AD and other entities (i.e., dietary supplements, chemicals, and drugs). The knowledge graph constructed can facilitate data-driven knowledge discoveries and the generation of novel hypotheses.

- *Junyao Gao, Xinyang Jiang, Huishuai Zhang, Yifan Yang, Shuguang Dou, Dongsheng Li, Duoqian Miao, Cheng Deng, Cairong Zhao*

- `2211.15918v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15918v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.15918v1)

> While person Re-identification (Re-ID) has progressed rapidly due to its wide real-world applications, it also causes severe risks of leaking personal information from training data. Thus, this paper focuses on quantifying this risk by membership inference (MI) attack. Most of the existing MI attack algorithms focus on classification models, while Re-ID follows a totally different training and inference paradigm. Re-ID is a fine-grained recognition task with complex feature embedding, and model outputs commonly used by existing MI like logits and losses are not accessible during inference. Since Re-ID focuses on modelling the relative relationship between image pairs instead of individual semantics, we conduct a formal and empirical analysis which validates that the distribution shift of the inter-sample similarity between training and test set is a critical criterion for Re-ID membership inference. As a result, we propose a novel membership inference attack method based on the inter-sample similarity distribution. Specifically, a set of anchor images are sampled to represent the similarity distribution conditioned on a target image, and a neural network with a novel anchor selection module is proposed to predict the membership of the target image. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both the Re-ID task and conventional classification task.

> Data mixing strategies (e.g., CutMix) have shown the ability to greatly improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They mix two images as inputs for training and assign them with a mixed label with the same ratio. While they are shown effective for vision transformers (ViTs), we identify a token fluctuation phenomenon that has suppressed the potential of data mixing strategies. We empirically observe that the contributions of input tokens fluctuate as forward propagating, which might induce a different mixing ratio in the output tokens. The training target computed by the original data mixing strategy can thus be inaccurate, resulting in less effective training. To address this, we propose a token-label alignment (TL-Align) method to trace the correspondence between transformed tokens and the original tokens to maintain a label for each token. We reuse the computed attention at each layer for efficient token-label alignment, introducing only negligible additional training costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves the performance of ViTs on image classification, semantic segmentation, objective detection, and transfer learning tasks. Code is available at: https://github.com/Euphoria16/TL-Align.

> Solving math word problems is the task that analyses the relation of quantities and requires an accurate understanding of contextual natural language information. Recent studies show that current models rely on shallow heuristics to predict solutions and could be easily misled by small textual perturbations. To address this problem, we propose a Textual Enhanced Contrastive Learning framework, which enforces the models to distinguish semantically similar examples while holding different mathematical logic. We adopt a self-supervised manner strategy to enrich examples with subtle textual variance by textual reordering or problem re-construction. We then retrieve the hardest to differentiate samples from both equation and textual perspectives and guide the model to learn their representations. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art on both widely used benchmark datasets and also exquisitely designed challenge datasets in English and Chinese. \footnote{Our code and data is available at \url{https://github.com/yiyunya/Textual_CL_MWP}

- `2211.16047v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16047v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.16047v1)

> We are interested in neurosymbolic systems consisting of a high-level symbolic layer for explainable prediction in terms of human-intelligible concepts; and a low-level neural layer for extracting symbols required to generate the symbolic explanation. Real data is often imperfect meaning that even if the symbolic theory remains unchanged, we may still need to address the problem of mapping raw data to high-level symbols, each time there is a change in the data acquisition environment or equipment. Manual (re-)annotation of the raw data each time this happens is laborious and expensive; and automated labelling methods are often imperfect, especially for complex problems. NEUROLOG proposed the use of a semantic loss function that allows an existing feature-based symbolic model to guide the extraction of feature-values from raw data, using `abduction'. However, the experiments demonstrating the use of semantic loss through abduction appear to rely heavily on a domain-specific pre-processing step that enables a prior delineation of feature locations in the raw data. We examine the use of semantic loss in domains where such pre-processing is not possible, or is not obvious. We show that without any prior information about the features, the NEUROLOG approach can continue to predict accurately even with substantially incorrect feature predictions. We show also that prior information about the features in the form of even imperfect pre-training can help correct this situation. These findings are replicated on the original problem considered by NEUROLOG, without the use of feature-delineation. This suggests that symbolic explanations constructed for data in a domain could be re-used in a related domain, by `feature-adaptation' of pre-trained neural extractors using the semantic loss function constrained by abductive feedback.

- `2211.16187v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16187v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.16187v1)

> We study the problem of training and certifying adversarially robust quantized neural networks (QNNs). Quantization is a technique for making neural networks more efficient by running them using low-bit integer arithmetic and is therefore commonly adopted in industry. Recent work has shown that floating-point neural networks that have been verified to be robust can become vulnerable to adversarial attacks after quantization, and certification of the quantized representation is necessary to guarantee robustness. In this work, we present quantization-aware interval bound propagation (QA-IBP), a novel method for training robust QNNs. Inspired by advances in robust learning of non-quantized networks, our training algorithm computes the gradient of an abstract representation of the actual network. Unlike existing approaches, our method can handle the discrete semantics of QNNs. Based on QA-IBP, we also develop a complete verification procedure for verifying the adversarial robustness of QNNs, which is guaranteed to terminate and produce a correct answer. Compared to existing approaches, the key advantage of our verification procedure is that it runs entirely on GPU or other accelerator devices. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods and establish the new state-of-the-art for training and certifying the robustness of QNNs.

> A major challenge in machine learning is resilience to out-of-distribution data, that is data that exists outside of the distribution of a model's training data. Training is often performed using limited, carefully curated datasets and so when a model is deployed there is often a significant distribution shift as edge cases and anomalies not included in the training data are encountered. To address this, we propose the Input Optimisation Network, an image preprocessing model that learns to optimise input data for a specific target vision model. In this work we investigate several out-of-distribution scenarios in the context of semantic segmentation for autonomous vehicles, comparing an Input Optimisation based solution to existing approaches of finetuning the target model with augmented training data and an adversarially trained preprocessing model. We demonstrate that our approach can enable performance on such data comparable to that of a finetuned model, and subsequently that a combined approach, whereby an input optimization network is optimised to target a finetuned model, delivers superior performance to either method in isolation. Finally, we propose a joint optimisation approach, in which input optimization network and target model are trained simultaneously, which we demonstrate achieves significant further performance gains, particularly in challenging edge-case scenarios. We also demonstrate that our architecture can be reduced to a relatively compact size without a significant performance impact, potentially facilitating real time embedded applications.

> The ability to compare the semantic similarity between text corpora is important in a variety of natural language processing applications. However, standard methods for evaluating these metrics have yet to be established. We propose a set of automatic and interpretable measures for assessing the characteristics of corpus-level semantic similarity metrics, allowing sensible comparison of their behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our evaluation measures in capturing fundamental characteristics by evaluating them on a collection of classical and state-of-the-art metrics. Our measures revealed that recently-developed metrics are becoming better in identifying semantic distributional mismatch while classical metrics are more sensitive to perturbations in the surface text levels.

> Deep metric learning aims to learn an embedding space, where semantically similar samples are close together and dissimilar ones are repelled against. To explore more hard and informative training signals for augmentation and generalization, recent methods focus on generating synthetic samples to boost metric learning losses. However, these methods just use the deterministic and class-independent generations (e.g., simple linear interpolation), which only can cover the limited part of distribution spaces around original samples. They have overlooked the wide characteristic changes of different classes and can not model abundant intra-class variations for generations. Therefore, generated samples not only lack rich semantics within the certain class, but also might be noisy signals to disturb training. In this paper, we propose a novel intra-class adaptive augmentation (IAA) framework for deep metric learning. We reasonably estimate intra-class variations for every class and generate adaptive synthetic samples to support hard samples mining and boost metric learning losses. Further, for most datasets that have a few samples within the class, we propose the neighbor correction to revise the inaccurate estimations, according to our correlation discovery where similar classes generally have similar variation distributions. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show our method significantly improves and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on retrieval performances by 3%-6%.

> Knowledge of the symmetries of reinforcement learning (RL) systems can be used to create compressed and semantically meaningful representations of a low-level state space. We present a method of automatically detecting RL symmetries directly from raw trajectory data without requiring active control of the system. Our method generates candidate symmetries and trains a recurrent neural network (RNN) to discriminate between the original trajectories and the transformed trajectories for each candidate symmetry. The RNN discriminator's accuracy for each candidate reveals how symmetric the system is under that transformation. This information can be used to create high-level representations that are invariant to all symmetries on a dataset level and to communicate properties of the RL behavior to users. We show in experiments on two simulated RL use cases (a pusher robot and a UAV flying in wind) that our method can determine the symmetries underlying both the environment physics and the trained RL policy.

We examine total and partial temporal (in)consistency relations between sets of temporal formulae. Then we propose a new Temporal Parametric Semantics, which may combine several sub-functions, allowing to use different assessment strategies. Finally, we expose the constraints that semantics must respect to satisfy our principles.

> Learning good representation of giga-pixel level whole slide pathology images (WSI) for downstream tasks is critical. Previous studies employ multiple instance learning (MIL) to represent WSIs as bags of sampled patches because, for most occasions, only slide-level labels are available, and only a tiny region of the WSI is disease-positive area. However, WSI representation learning still remains an open problem due to: (1) patch sampling on a higher resolution may be incapable of depicting microenvironment information such as the relative position between the tumor cells and surrounding tissues, while patches at lower resolution lose the fine-grained detail; (2) extracting patches from giant WSI results in large bag size, which tremendously increases the computational cost. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical-based multimodal transformer framework that learns a hierarchical mapping between pathology images and corresponding genes. Precisely, we randomly extract instant-level patch features from WSIs with different magnification. Then a co-attention mapping between imaging and genomics is learned to uncover the pairwise interaction and reduce the space complexity of imaging features. Such early fusion makes it computationally feasible to use MIL Transformer for the survival prediction task. Our architecture requires fewer GPU resources compared with benchmark methods while maintaining better WSI representation ability. We evaluate our approach on five cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas database and achieved an average c-index of $0.673$, outperforming the state-of-the-art multimodality methods.

> Process mining is a methodology for the derivation and analysis of process models based on the event log. When process mining is employed to analyze business processes, the process discovery step, the conformance checking step, and the enhancements step are repeated. If a user wants to analyze a process from multiple perspectives (such as activity perspectives, originator perspectives, and time perspectives), the above procedure, inconveniently, has to be repeated over and over again. Although past studies involving process mining have applied detailed stepwise methodologies, no attempt has been made to incorporate and optimize multi-perspective process mining procedures. This paper contributes to developing a solution approach to this problem. First, we propose an automatic discovery framework of a multi-perspective process model based on deep Q-Learning. Our Dual Experience Replay with Experience Distribution (DERED) approach can automatically perform process model discovery steps, conformance check steps, and enhancements steps. Second, we propose a new method that further optimizes the experience replay (ER) method, one of the key algorithms of deep Q-learning, to improve the learning performance of reinforcement learning agents. Finally, we validate our approach using six real-world event datasets collected in port logistics, steel manufacturing, finance, IT, and government administration. We show that our DERED approach can provide users with multi-perspective, high-quality process models that can be employed more conveniently for multi-perspective process mining.

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its data-centric branch of machine learning (ML) have greatly evolved over the last few decades. However, as AI is used increasingly in real world use cases, the importance of the interpretability of and accessibility to AI systems have become major research areas. The lack of interpretability of ML based systems is a major hindrance to widespread adoption of these powerful algorithms. This is due to many reasons including ethical and regulatory concerns, which have resulted in poorer adoption of ML in some areas. The recent past has seen a surge in research on interpretable ML. Generally, designing a ML system requires good domain understanding combined with expert knowledge. New techniques are emerging to improve ML accessibility through automated model design. This paper provides a review of the work done to improve interpretability and accessibility of machine learning in the context of global problems while also being relevant to developing countries. We review work under multiple levels of interpretability including scientific and mathematical interpretation, statistical interpretation and partial semantic interpretation. This review includes applications in three areas, namely food processing, agriculture and health.

> Recently, unsupervised learning has made impressive progress on various tasks. Despite the dominance of discriminative models, increasing attention is drawn to representations learned by generative models and in particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Previous works on the interpretation of GANs reveal that GANs encode semantics in feature maps in a linearly separable form. In this work, we further find that GAN's features can be well clustered with the linear separability assumption. We propose a novel clustering algorithm, named KLiSH, which leverages the linear separability to cluster GAN's features. KLiSH succeeds in extracting fine-grained semantics of GANs trained on datasets of various objects, e.g., car, portrait, animals, and so on. With KLiSH, we can sample images from GANs along with their segmentation masks and synthesize paired image-segmentation datasets. Using the synthesized datasets, we enable two downstream applications. First, we train semantic segmentation networks on these datasets and test them on real images, realizing unsupervised semantic segmentation. Second, we train image-to-image translation networks on the synthesized datasets, enabling semantic-conditional image synthesis without human annotations.

> Software requirements specification is undoubtedly critical for the whole software life-cycle. Nowadays, writing software requirements specifications primarily depends on human work. Although massive studies have been proposed to fasten the process via proposing advanced elicitation and analysis techniques, it is still a time-consuming and error-prone task that needs to take domain knowledge and business information into consideration. In this paper, we propose an approach, named ReqGen, which can provide recommendations by automatically generating natural language requirements specifications based on certain given keywords. Specifically, ReqGen consists of three critical steps. First, keywords-oriented knowledge is selected from domain ontology and is injected to the basic Unified pre-trained Language Model (UniLM) for domain fine-tuning. Second, a copy mechanism is integrated to ensure the occurrence of keywords in the generated statements. Finally, a requirement syntax constrained decoding is designed to close the semantic and syntax distance between the candidate and reference specifications. Experiments on two public datasets from different groups and domains show that ReqGen outperforms six popular natural language generation approaches with respect to the hard constraint of keywords(phrases) inclusion, BLEU, ROUGE and syntax compliance. We believe that ReqGen can promote the efficiency and intelligence of specifying software requirements.

> Meaningful uncertainty quantification in computer vision requires reasoning about semantic information -- say, the hair color of the person in a photo or the location of a car on the street. To this end, recent breakthroughs in generative modeling allow us to represent semantic information in disentangled latent spaces, but providing uncertainties on the semantic latent variables has remained challenging. In this work, we provide principled uncertainty intervals that are guaranteed to contain the true semantic factors for any underlying generative model. The method does the following: (1) it uses quantile regression to output a heuristic uncertainty interval for each element in the latent space (2) calibrates these uncertainties such that they contain the true value of the latent for a new, unseen input. The endpoints of these calibrated intervals can then be propagated through the generator to produce interpretable uncertainty visualizations for each semantic factor. This technique reliably communicates semantically meaningful, principled, and instance-adaptive uncertainty in inverse problems like image super-resolution and image completion.

This paper aims to extend 3D GANs to a different, but meaningful visual form: artistic portrait drawings. However, extending existing 3D GANs to drawings is challenging due to the inevitable geometric ambiguity present in drawings. To tackle this, we present Dr.3D, a novel adaptation approach that adapts an existing 3D GAN to artistic drawings. Dr.3D is equipped with three novel components to handle the geometric ambiguity: a deformation-aware 3D synthesis network, an alternating adaptation of pose estimation and image synthesis, and geometric priors. Experiments show that our approach can successfully adapt 3D GANs to drawings and enable multi-view consistent semantic editing of drawings.

The representation is also linguistically motivated with the introduction of a novel similarity metric. The proposed modelling and the novel similarity metric exploits the matrix structure of embeddings. We then go on to show that the same matrices can be reshaped into vectors of unit norm and transform our problem into an optimization problem over the spherical manifold. We exploit manifold optimization to efficiently train the matrix embeddings. We also quantitatively verify the quality of our text embeddings by showing that they demonstrate improved results in document classification, document clustering, and semantic textual similarity benchmark tests.

> Graphic sketch representations are effective for representing sketches. Existing methods take the patches cropped from sketches as the graph nodes, and construct the edges based on sketch's drawing order or Euclidean distances on the canvas. However, the drawing order of a sketch may not be unique, while the patches from semantically related parts of a sketch may be far away from each other on the canvas. In this paper, we propose an order-invariant, semantics-aware method for graphic sketch representations. The cropped sketch patches are linked according to their global semantics or local geometric shapes, namely the synonymous proximity, by computing the cosine similarity between the captured patch embeddings. Such constructed edges are learnable to adapt to the variation of sketch drawings, which enable the message passing among synonymous patches. Aggregating the messages from synonymous patches by graph convolutional networks plays a role of denoising, which is beneficial to produce robust patch embeddings and accurate sketch representations. Furthermore, we enforce a clustering constraint over the embeddings jointly with the network learning. The synonymous patches are self-organized as compact clusters, and their embeddings are guided to move towards their assigned cluster centroids. It raises the accuracy of the computed synonymous proximity. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance on both controllable sketch synthesis and sketch healing.

> Graph neural networks for heterogeneous graph embedding is to project nodes into a low-dimensional space by exploring the heterogeneity and semantics of the heterogeneous graph. However, on the one hand, most of existing heterogeneous graph embedding methods either insufficiently model the local structure under specific semantic, or neglect the heterogeneity when aggregating information from it. On the other hand, representations from multiple semantics are not comprehensively integrated to obtain versatile node embeddings. To address the problem, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Multi-View Representation Learning (named MV-HetGNN) for heterogeneous graph embedding by introducing the idea of multi-view representation learning. The proposed model consists of node feature transformation, view-specific ego graph encoding and auto multi-view fusion to thoroughly learn complex structural and semantic information for generating comprehensive node representations. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that the proposed MV-HetGNN model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines in various downstream tasks, e.g., node classification, node clustering, and link prediction.

> This work aims at generating captions for soccer videos using deep learning. In this context, this paper introduces a dataset, model, and triple-level evaluation. The dataset consists of 22k caption-clip pairs and three visual features (images, optical flow, inpainting) for ~500 hours of \emph{SoccerNet} videos. The model is divided into three parts: a transformer learns language, ConvNets learn vision, and a fusion of linguistic and visual features generates captions. The paper suggests evaluating generated captions at three levels: syntax (the commonly used evaluation metrics such as BLEU-score and CIDEr), meaning (the quality of descriptions for a domain expert), and corpus (the diversity of generated captions). The paper shows that the diversity of generated captions has improved (from 0.07 reaching 0.18) with semantics-related losses that prioritize selected words. Semantics-related losses and the utilization of more visual features (optical flow, inpainting) improved the normalized captioning score by 28\%.

> We present BotSIM, a data-efficient end-to-end Bot SIMulation toolkit for commercial text-based task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems. BotSIM consists of three major components: 1) a Generator that can infer semantic-level dialog acts and entities from bot definitions and generate user queries via model-based paraphrasing; 2) an agenda-based dialog user Simulator (ABUS) to simulate conversations with the dialog agents; 3) a Remediator to analyze the simulated conversations, visualize the bot health reports and provide actionable remediation suggestions for bot troubleshooting and improvement. We demonstrate BotSIM's effectiveness in end-to-end evaluation, remediation and multi-intent dialog generation via case studies on two commercial bot platforms. BotSIM's "generation-simulation-remediation" paradigm accelerates the end-to-end bot evaluation and iteration process by: 1) reducing manual test cases creation efforts; 2) enabling a holistic gauge of the bot in terms of NLU and end-to-end performance via extensive dialog simulation; 3) improving the bot troubleshooting process with actionable suggestions.

> Partial Label (PL) learning refers to the task of learning from the partially labeled data, where each training instance is ambiguously equipped with a set of candidate labels but only one is valid. Advances in the recent deep PL learning literature have shown that the deep learning paradigms, e.g., self-training, contrastive learning, or class activate values, can achieve promising performance. Inspired by the impressive success of deep Semi-Supervised (SS) learning, we transform the PL learning problem into the SS learning problem, and propose a novel PL learning method, namely Partial Label learning with Semi-supervised Perspective (PLSP). Specifically, we first form the pseudo-labeled dataset by selecting a small number of reliable pseudo-labeled instances with high-confidence prediction scores and treating the remaining instances as pseudo-unlabeled ones. Then we design a SS learning objective, consisting of a supervised loss for pseudo-labeled instances and a semantic consistency regularization for pseudo-unlabeled instances. We further introduce a complementary regularization for those non-candidate labels to constrain the model predictions on them to be as small as possible. Empirical results demonstrate that PLSP significantly outperforms the existing PL baseline methods, especially on high ambiguity levels. Code available: https://github.com/changchunli/PLSP.

> Controllable image synthesis with user scribbles has gained huge public interest with the recent advent of text-conditioned latent diffusion models. The user scribbles control the color composition while the text prompt provides control over the overall image semantics. However, we note that prior works in this direction suffer from an intrinsic domain shift problem, wherein the generated outputs often lack details and resemble simplistic representations of the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel guided image synthesis framework, which addresses this problem by modeling the output image as the solution of a constrained optimization problem. We show that while computing an exact solution to the optimization is infeasible, an approximation of the same can be achieved while just requiring a single pass of the reverse diffusion process. Additionally, we show that by simply defining a cross-attention based correspondence between the input text tokens and the user stroke-painting, the user is also able to control the semantics of different painted regions without requiring any conditional training or finetuning. Human user study results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by over 85.32% on the overall user satisfaction scores.

> While monocular depth estimation (MDE) is an important problem in computer vision, it is difficult due to the ambiguity that results from the compression of a 3D scene into only 2 dimensions. It is common practice in the field to treat it as simple image-to-image translation, without consideration for the semantics of the scene and the objects within it. In contrast, humans and animals have been shown to use higher-level information to solve MDE: prior knowledge of the nature of the objects in the scene, their positions and likely configurations relative to one another, and their apparent sizes have all been shown to help resolve this ambiguity.   In this paper, we present a novel method to enhance MDE performance by encouraging use of known-useful information about the semantics of objects and inter-object relationships within a scene. Our novel ObjCAViT module sources world-knowledge from language models and learns inter-object relationships in the context of the MDE problem using transformer attention, incorporating apparent size information. Our method produces highly accurate depth maps, and we obtain competitive results on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets. Our ablation experiments show that the use of language and cross-attention within the ObjCAViT module increases performance. Code is released at https://github.com/DylanAuty/ObjCAViT.

> Holistic methods using CNNs and margin-based losses have dominated research on face recognition. In this work, we depart from this setting in two ways: (a) we employ the Vision Transformer as an architecture for training a very strong baseline for face recognition, simply called fViT, which already surpasses most state-of-the-art face recognition methods. (b) Secondly, we capitalize on the Transformer's inherent property to process information (visual tokens) extracted from irregular grids to devise a pipeline for face recognition which is reminiscent of part-based face recognition methods. Our pipeline, called part fViT, simply comprises a lightweight network to predict the coordinates of facial landmarks followed by the Vision Transformer operating on patches extracted from the predicted landmarks, and it is trained end-to-end with no landmark supervision. By learning to extract discriminative patches, our part-based Transformer further boosts the accuracy of our Vision Transformer baseline achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on several face recognition benchmarks.

> Topological data analysis (TDA) is a branch of computational mathematics, bridging algebraic topology and data science, that provides compact, noise-robust representations of complex structures. Deep neural networks (DNNs) learn millions of parameters associated with a series of transformations defined by the model architecture, resulting in high-dimensional, difficult-to-interpret internal representations of input data. As DNNs become more ubiquitous across multiple sectors of our society, there is increasing recognition that mathematical methods are needed to aid analysts, researchers, and practitioners in understanding and interpreting how these models' internal representations relate to the final classification. In this paper, we apply cutting edge techniques from TDA with the goal of gaining insight into the interpretability of convolutional neural networks used for image classification. We use two common TDA approaches to explore several methods for modeling hidden-layer activations as high-dimensional point clouds, and provide experimental evidence that these point clouds capture valuable structural information about the model's process. First, we demonstrate that a distance metric based on persistent homology can be used to quantify meaningful differences between layers, and we discuss these distances in the broader context of existing representational similarity metrics for neural network interpretability. Second, we show that a mapper graph can provide semantic insight into how these models organize hierarchical class knowledge at each layer. These observations demonstrate that TDA is a useful tool to help deep learning practitioners unlock the hidden structures of their models.

> Complex dialogue mappings (CDM), including one-to-many and many-to-one mappings, tend to make dialogue models generate incoherent or dull responses, and modeling these mappings remains a huge challenge for neural dialogue systems. To alleviate these problems, methods like introducing external information, reconstructing the optimization function, and manipulating data samples are proposed, while they primarily focus on avoiding training with CDM, inevitably weakening the model's ability of understanding CDM in human conversations and limiting further improvements in model performance. This paper proposes a Sentence Semantic \textbf{Seg}mentation guided \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder (SegCVAE) method which can model and take advantages of the CDM data. Specifically, to tackle the incoherent problem caused by one-to-many, SegCVAE uses response-related prominent semantics to constrained the latent variable. To mitigate the non-diverse problem brought by many-to-one, SegCVAE segments multiple prominent semantics to enrich the latent variables. Three novel components, Internal Separation, External Guidance, and Semantic Norms, are proposed to achieve SegCVAE. On dialogue generation tasks, both the automatic and human evaluation results show that SegCVAE achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

> Much recent work in task-oriented parsing has focused on finding a middle ground between flat slots and intents, which are inexpressive but easy to annotate, and powerful representations such as the lambda calculus, which are expressive but costly to annotate. This paper continues the exploration of task-oriented parsing by introducing a new dataset for parsing pizza and drink orders, whose semantics cannot be captured by flat slots and intents. We perform an extensive evaluation of deep-learning techniques for task-oriented parsing on this dataset, including different flavors of seq2seq systems and RNNGs. The dataset comes in two main versions, one in a recently introduced utterance-level hierarchical notation that we call TOP, and one whose targets are executable representations (EXR). We demonstrate empirically that training the parser to directly generate EXR notation not only solves the problem of entity resolution in one fell swoop and overcomes a number of expressive limitations of TOP notation, but also results in significantly greater parsing accuracy.

> In medical image analysis, automated segmentation of multi-component anatomical structures, which often have a spectrum of potential anomalies and pathologies, is a challenging task. In this work, we develop a multi-step approach using U-Net-based neural networks to initially detect anomalies (bone marrow lesions, bone cysts) in the distal femur, proximal tibia and patella from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images of the knee in individuals with varying grades of osteoarthritis. Subsequently, the extracted data are used for downstream tasks involving semantic segmentation of individual bone and cartilage volumes as well as bone anomalies. For anomaly detection, the U-Net-based models were developed to reconstruct the bone profiles of the femur and tibia in images via inpainting so anomalous bone regions could be replaced with close to normal appearances. The reconstruction error was used to detect bone anomalies. A second anomaly-aware network, which was compared to anomaly-na\"ive segmentation networks, was used to provide a final automated segmentation of the femoral, tibial and patellar bones and cartilages from the knee MR images containing a spectrum of bone anomalies. The anomaly-aware segmentation approach provided up to 58% reduction in Hausdorff distances for bone segmentations compared to the results from the anomaly-na\"ive segmentation networks. In addition, the anomaly-aware networks were able to detect bone lesions in the MR images with greater sensitivity and specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] up to 0.896) compared to the anomaly-na\"ive segmentation networks (AUC up to 0.874).

> Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating robust neural learning and sound symbolic reasoning into a single framework, so as to leverage the complementary strengths of both of these, seemingly unrelated (maybe even contradictory) AI paradigms. The central challenge in neural-symbolic computing is to unify the formulation of neural learning and symbolic reasoning into a single framework with common semantics, that is, to seek a joint representation between a neural model and a logical theory that can support the basic grounding learned by the neural model and also stick to the semantics of the logical theory. In this paper, we propose differentiable fuzzy $\mathcal{ALC}$ (DF-$\mathcal{ALC}$) for this role, as a neural-symbolic representation language with the desired semantics. DF-$\mathcal{ALC}$ unifies the description logic $\mathcal{ALC}$ and neural models for symbol grounding; in particular, it infuses an $\mathcal{ALC}$ knowledge base into neural models through differentiable concept and role embeddings. We define a hierarchical loss to the constraint that the grounding learned by neural models must be semantically consistent with $\mathcal{ALC}$ knowledge bases. And we find that capturing the semantics in grounding solely by maximizing satisfiability cannot revise grounding rationally. We further define a rule-based loss for DF adapting to symbol grounding problems. The experiment results show that DF-$\mathcal{ALC}$ with rule-based loss can improve the performance of image object detectors in an unsupervised learning way, even in low-resource situations.

> We tackle the problem of target-free text-guided image manipulation, which requires one to modify the input reference image based on the given text instruction, while no ground truth target image is observed during training. To address this challenging task, we propose a Cyclic-Manipulation GAN (cManiGAN) in this paper, which is able to realize where and how to edit the image regions of interest. Specifically, the image editor in cManiGAN learns to identify and complete the input image, while cross-modal interpreter and reasoner are deployed to verify the semantic correctness of the output image based on the input instruction. While the former utilizes factual/counterfactual description learning for authenticating the image semantics, the latter predicts the "undo" instruction and provides pixel-level supervision for the training of cManiGAN. With such operational cycle-consistency, our cManiGAN can be trained in the above weakly supervised setting. We conduct extensive experiments on the datasets of CLEVR and COCO, and the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method can be successfully verified.

> Approximation fixpoint theory (AFT) is an abstract and general algebraic framework for studying the semantics of nonmonotonic logics. It provides a unifying study of the semantics of different formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning, such as logic programming, default logic and autoepistemic logic. In this paper, we extend AFT to dealing with non-deterministic constructs that allow to handle indefinite information, represented e.g. by disjunctive formulas. This is done by generalizing the main constructions and corresponding results of AFT to non-deterministic operators, whose ranges are sets of elements rather than single elements. The applicability and usefulness of this generalization is illustrated in the context of disjunctive logic programming.

> While existing security protocols were designed with a focus on the core network, the enhancement of the security of the B5G access network becomes of critical importance. Despite the strengthening of 5G security protocols with respect to LTE, there are still open issues that have not been fully addressed. This work is articulated around the premise that rethinking the security design bottom up, starting at the physical layer, is not only viable in 6G but importantly, arises as an efficient way to overcome security hurdles in novel use cases, notably massive machine type communications (mMTC), ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC) and autonomous cyberphysical systems. Unlike existing review papers that treat physical layer security orthogonally to cryptography, we will try to provide a few insights of underlying connections. Discussing many practical issues, we will present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in i) secret key generation from shared randomness, ii) the wiretap channel and fundamental limits, iii) authentication of devices using physical unclonable functions (PUFs), localization and multi-factor authentication, and, iv) jamming attacks at the physical layer.

> Alignment between image and text has shown promising improvements on patch-level pre-trained document image models. However, investigating more effective or finer-grained alignment techniques during pre-training requires a large amount of computation cost and time. Thus, a question naturally arises: Could we fine-tune the pre-trained models adaptive to downstream tasks with alignment objectives and achieve comparable or better performance? In this paper, we propose a new model architecture with alignment-enriched tuning (dubbed AETNet) upon pre-trained document image models, to adapt downstream tasks with the joint task-specific supervised and alignment-aware contrastive objective. Specifically, we introduce an extra visual transformer as the alignment-ware image encoder and an extra text transformer as the alignment-ware text encoder before multimodal fusion. We consider alignment in the following three aspects: 1) document-level alignment by leveraging the cross-modal and intra-modal contrastive loss; 2) global-local alignment for modeling localized and structural information in document images; and 3) local-level alignment for more accurate patch-level information. Experiments on various downstream tasks show that AETNet can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. Notably, AETNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pre-trained models, such as LayoutLMv3 with fine-tuning techniques, on three different downstream tasks.

> Point cloud completion, as the upstream procedure of 3D recognition and segmentation, has become an essential part of many tasks such as navigation and scene understanding. While various point cloud completion models have demonstrated their powerful capabilities, their robustness against adversarial attacks, which have been proven to be fatally malicious towards deep neural networks, remains unknown. In addition, existing attack approaches towards point cloud classifiers cannot be applied to the completion models due to different output forms and attack purposes. In order to evaluate the robustness of the completion models, we propose PointCA, the first adversarial attack against 3D point cloud completion models. PointCA can generate adversarial point clouds that maintain high similarity with the original ones, while being completed as another object with totally different semantic information. Specifically, we minimize the representation discrepancy between the adversarial example and the target point set to jointly explore the adversarial point clouds in the geometry space and the feature space. Furthermore, to launch a stealthier attack, we innovatively employ the neighbourhood density information to tailor the perturbation constraint, leading to geometry-aware and distribution-adaptive modifications for each point. Extensive experiments against different premier point cloud completion networks show that PointCA can cause a performance degradation from 77.9% to 16.7%, with the structure chamfer distance kept below 0.01. We conclude that existing completion models are severely vulnerable to adversarial examples, and state-of-the-art defenses for point cloud classification will be partially invalid when applied to incomplete and uneven point cloud data.

> Training effective embodied AI agents often involves manual reward engineering, expert imitation, specialized components such as maps, or leveraging additional sensors for depth and localization. Another approach is to use neural architectures alongside self-supervised objectives which encourage better representation learning. In practice, there are few guarantees that these self-supervised objectives encode task-relevant information. We propose the Scene Graph Contrastive (SGC) loss, which uses scene graphs as general-purpose, training-only, supervisory signals. The SGC loss does away with explicit graph decoding and instead uses contrastive learning to align an agent's representation with a rich graphical encoding of its environment. The SGC loss is generally applicable, simple to implement, and encourages representations that encode objects' semantics, relationships, and history. Using the SGC loss, we attain significant gains on three embodied tasks: Object Navigation, Multi-Object Navigation, and Arm Point Navigation. Finally, we present studies and analyses which demonstrate the ability of our trained representation to encode semantic cues about the environment.

Motivated by the observation that visually similar objects are close in the representation space, we argue that the scenes and objects should instead follow a hierarchical structure based on their compositionality. To exploit such a structure, we propose a contrastive learning framework where a Euclidean loss is used to learn object representations and a hyperbolic loss is used to encourage representations of scenes to lie close to representations of their constituent objects in a hyperbolic space. This novel hyperbolic objective encourages the scene-object hypernymy among the representations by optimizing the magnitude of their norms. We show that when pretraining on the COCO and OpenImages datasets, the hyperbolic loss improves downstream performance of several baselines across multiple datasets and tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. We also show that the properties of the learned representations allow us to solve various vision tasks that involve the interaction between scenes and objects in a zero-shot fashion.

> Our goal in this paper is to exploit heteroscedastic temperature scaling as a calibration strategy for out of distribution (OOD) detection. Heteroscedasticity here refers to the fact that the optimal temperature parameter for each sample can be different, as opposed to conventional approaches that use the same value for the entire distribution. To enable this, we propose a new training strategy called anchoring that can estimate appropriate temperature values for each sample, leading to state-of-the-art OOD detection performance across several benchmarks. Using NTK theory, we show that this temperature function estimate is closely linked to the epistemic uncertainty of the classifier, which explains its behavior. In contrast to some of the best-performing OOD detection approaches, our method does not require exposure to additional outlier datasets, custom calibration objectives, or model ensembling. Through empirical studies with different OOD detection settings -- far OOD, near OOD, and semantically coherent OOD - we establish a highly effective OOD detection approach. Code to reproduce our results is available at github.com/LLNL/AMP

> Dense passage retrieval aims to retrieve the relevant passages of a query from a large corpus based on dense representations (i.e., vectors) of the query and the passages. Recent studies have explored improving pre-trained language models to boost dense retrieval performance. This paper proposes CoT-MAE (ConTextual Masked Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective generative pre-training method for dense passage retrieval. CoT-MAE employs an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture that learns to compress the sentence semantics into a dense vector through self-supervised and context-supervised masked auto-encoding. Precisely, self-supervised masked auto-encoding learns to model the semantics of the tokens inside a text span, and context-supervised masked auto-encoding learns to model the semantical correlation between the text spans. We conduct experiments on large-scale passage retrieval benchmarks and show considerable improvements over strong baselines, demonstrating the high efficiency of CoT-MAE.

> Semantic navigation is necessary to deploy mobile robots in uncontrolled environments like our homes, schools, and hospitals. Many learning-based approaches have been proposed in response to the lack of semantic understanding of the classical pipeline for spatial navigation, which builds a geometric map using depth sensors and plans to reach point goals. Broadly, end-to-end learning approaches reactively map sensor inputs to actions with deep neural networks, while modular learning approaches enrich the classical pipeline with learning-based semantic sensing and exploration. But learned visual navigation policies have predominantly been evaluated in simulation. How well do different classes of methods work on a robot? We present a large-scale empirical study of semantic visual navigation methods comparing representative methods from classical, modular, and end-to-end learning approaches across six homes with no prior experience, maps, or instrumentation. We find that modular learning works well in the real world, attaining a 90% success rate. In contrast, end-to-end learning does not, dropping from 77% simulation to 23% real-world success rate due to a large image domain gap between simulation and reality. For practitioners, we show that modular learning is a reliable approach to navigate to objects: modularity and abstraction in policy design enable Sim-to-Real transfer. For researchers, we identify two key issues that prevent today's simulators from being reliable evaluation benchmarks - (A) a large Sim-to-Real gap in images and (B) a disconnect between simulation and real-world error modes - and propose concrete steps forward.

Its design was influenced by the need for a high quality, large scale web corpus to support a range of academic and industry research, for example, in information systems, retrieval-augmented AI systems, and model pretraining. Compared with earlier ClueWeb corpora, the ClueWeb22 corpus is larger, more varied, of higher-quality, and aligned with the document distributions in commercial web search. Besides raw HTML, ClueWeb22 includes rich information about the web pages provided by industry-standard document understanding systems, including the visual representation of pages rendered by a web browser, parsed HTML structure information from a neural network parser, and pre-processed cleaned document text to lower the barrier to entry. Many of these signals have been widely used in industry but are available to the research community for the first time at this scale.

> While Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a widely studied task, making inferences of entities with only a few labeled data has been challenging, especially for entities with nested structures. Unlike flat entities, entities and their nested entities are more likely to have similar semantic feature representations, drastically increasing difficulties in classifying different entity categories in the few-shot setting. Although prior work has briefly discussed nested structures in the context of few-shot learning, to our best knowledge, this paper is the first one specifically dedicated to studying the few-shot nested NER task. Leveraging contextual dependency to distinguish nested entities, we propose a Biaffine-based Contrastive Learning (BCL) framework. We first design a Biaffine span representation module for learning the contextual span dependency representation for each entity span rather than only learning its semantic representation. We then merge these two representations by the residual connection to distinguish nested entities. Finally, we build a contrastive learning framework to adjust the representation distribution for larger margin boundaries and more generalized domain transfer learning ability. We conducted experimental studies on three English, German, and Russian nested NER datasets. The results show that the BCL outperformed three baseline models on the 1-shot and 5-shot tasks in terms of F1 score.

> In today's era of digital misinformation, we are increasingly faced with new threats posed by video falsification techniques. Such falsifications range from cheapfakes (e.g., lookalikes or audio dubbing) to deepfakes (e.g., sophisticated AI media synthesis methods), which are becoming perceptually indistinguishable from real videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-modal semantic forensic approach to discover clues that go beyond detecting discrepancies in visual quality, thereby handling both simpler cheapfakes and visually persuasive deepfakes. In this work, our goal is to verify that the purported person seen in the video is indeed themselves by detecting anomalous facial movements corresponding to the spoken words. We leverage the idea of attribution to learn person-specific biometric patterns that distinguish a given speaker from others. We use interpretable Action Units (AUs) to capture a person's face and head movement as opposed to deep CNN features, and we are the first to use word-conditioned facial motion analysis. We further demonstrate our method's effectiveness on a range of fakes not seen in training including those without video manipulation, that were not addressed in prior work.

> Credit assignment problem of neural networks refers to evaluating the credit of each network component to the final outputs. For an untrained neural network, approaches to tackling it have made great contributions to parameter update and model revolution during the training phase. This problem on trained neural networks receives rare attention, nevertheless, it plays an increasingly important role in neural network patch, specification and verification. Based on Koopman operator theory, this paper presents an alternative perspective of linear dynamics on dealing with the credit assignment problem for trained neural networks. Regarding a neural network as the composition of sub-dynamics series, we utilize step-delay embedding to capture snapshots of each component, characterizing the established mapping as exactly as possible. To circumvent the dimension-difference problem encountered during the embedding, a composition and decomposition of an auxiliary linear layer, termed minimal linear dimension alignment, is carefully designed with rigorous formal guarantee. Afterwards, each component is approximated by a Koopman operator and we derive the Jacobian matrix and its corresponding determinant, similar to backward propagation. Then, we can define a metric with algebraic interpretability for the credit assignment of each network component. Moreover, experiments conducted on typical neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

> Automated bug priority inference can reduce the time overhead of bug triagers for priority assignments, improving the efficiency of software maintenance. Currently, there are two orthogonal lines for this task, i.e., traditional machine learning based (TML-based) and neural network based (NN-based) approaches. Although these approaches achieve competitive performance, our observation finds that existing approaches face the following two issues: 1) TML-based approaches require much manual feature engineering and cannot learn the semantic information of bug reports; 2) Both TML-based and NN-based approaches cannot effectively address the label imbalance problem because they are difficult to distinguish the semantic difference between bug reports with different priorities. In this paper, we propose CLeBPI (Contrastive Learning for Bug Priority Inference), which leverages pre-trained language model and contrastive learning to tackle the above-mentioned two issues. Specifically, CLeBPI is first pre-trained on a large-scale bug report corpus in a self-supervised way, thus it can automatically learn contextual representations of bug reports without manual feature engineering. Afterward, it is further pre-trained by a contrastive learning objective, which enables it to distinguish semantic differences between bug reports, learning more precise contextual representations for each bug report. When finishing pre-training, we can connect a classification layer to CLeBPI and fine-tune it for bug priority inference in a supervised way. To verify the effectiveness of CLeBPI, we choose four baseline approaches and conduct comparison experiments on a public dataset. The experimental results show that CLeBPI outperforms all baseline approaches by 23.86%-77.80% in terms of weighted average F1-score, showing its effectiveness.

> Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has the potential to be used for synthesizing feedback controllers (agents) for various complex systems with unknown dynamics. These systems are expected to satisfy diverse safety and liveness properties best captured using temporal logic. In RL, the reward function plays a crucial role in specifying the desired behaviour of these agents. However, the problem of designing the reward function for an RL agent to satisfy complex temporal logic specifications has received limited attention in the literature. To address this, we provide a systematic way of generating rewards in real-time by using the quantitative semantics of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a widely used temporal logic to specify the behaviour of cyber-physical systems. We propose a new quantitative semantics for STL having several desirable properties, making it suitable for reward generation. We evaluate our STL-based reinforcement learning mechanism on several complex continuous control benchmarks and compare our STL semantics with those available in the literature in terms of their efficacy in synthesizing the controller agent. Experimental results establish our new semantics to be the most suitable for synthesizing feedback controllers for complex continuous dynamical systems through reinforcement learning.

> Visual Entailment with natural language explanations aims to infer the relationship between a text-image pair and generate a sentence to explain the decision-making process. Previous methods rely mainly on a pre-trained vision-language model to perform the relation inference and a language model to generate the corresponding explanation. However, the pre-trained vision-language models mainly build token-level alignment between text and image yet ignore the high-level semantic alignment between the phrases (chunks) and visual contents, which is critical for vision-language reasoning. Moreover, the explanation generator based only on the encoded joint representation does not explicitly consider the critical decision-making points of relation inference. Thus the generated explanations are less faithful to visual-language reasoning. To mitigate these problems, we propose a unified Chunk-aware Alignment and Lexical Constraint based method, dubbed as CALeC. It contains a Chunk-aware Semantic Interactor (arr. CSI), a relation inferrer, and a Lexical Constraint-aware Generator (arr. LeCG). Specifically, CSI exploits the sentence structure inherent in language and various image regions to build chunk-aware semantic alignment. Relation inferrer uses an attention-based reasoning network to incorporate the token-level and chunk-level vision-language representations. LeCG utilizes lexical constraints to expressly incorporate the words or chunks focused by the relation inferrer into explanation generation, improving the faithfulness and informativeness of the explanations. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, and experimental results indicate that CALeC significantly outperforms other competitor models on inference accuracy and quality of generated explanations.

> The opaqueness of the multi-hop fact verification model imposes imperative requirements for explainability. One feasible way is to extract rationales, a subset of inputs, where the performance of prediction drops dramatically when being removed. Though being explainable, most rationale extraction methods for multi-hop fact verification explore the semantic information within each piece of evidence individually, while ignoring the topological information interaction among different pieces of evidence. Intuitively, a faithful rationale bears complementary information being able to extract other rationales through the multi-hop reasoning process. To tackle such disadvantages, we cast explainable multi-hop fact verification as subgraph extraction, which can be solved based on graph convolutional network (GCN) with salience-aware graph learning. In specific, GCN is utilized to incorporate the topological interaction information among multiple pieces of evidence for learning evidence representation. Meanwhile, to alleviate the influence of noisy evidence, the salience-aware graph perturbation is induced into the message passing of GCN. Moreover, the multi-task model with three diagnostic properties of rationale is elaborately designed to improve the quality of an explanation without any explicit annotations. Experimental results on the FEVEROUS benchmark show significant gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for both rationale extraction and fact verification.

> Membership inference attacks aim to infer whether a data record has been used to train a target model by observing its predictions. In sensitive domains such as healthcare, this can constitute a severe privacy violation. In this work we attempt to address the existing knowledge gap by conducting an exhaustive study of membership inference attacks and defences in the domain of semantic image segmentation. Our findings indicate that for certain threat models, these learning settings can be considerably more vulnerable than the previously considered classification settings. We additionally investigate a threat model where a dishonest adversary can perform model poisoning to aid their inference and evaluate the effects that these adaptations have on the success of membership inference attacks. We quantitatively evaluate the attacks on a number of popular model architectures across a variety of semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating that membership inference attacks in this domain can achieve a high success rate and defending against them may result in unfavourable privacy-utility trade-offs or increased computational costs.

> One of the common traits of past and present approaches for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is that they rely upon discrete labels drawn from a predefined linguistic inventory to classify predicate senses and their arguments. However, we argue this need not be the case. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages Definition Modeling to introduce a generalized formulation of SRL as the task of describing predicate-argument structures using natural language definitions instead of discrete labels. Our novel formulation takes a first step towards placing interpretability and flexibility foremost, and yet our experiments and analyses on PropBank-style and FrameNet-style, dependency-based and span-based SRL also demonstrate that a flexible model with an interpretable output does not necessarily come at the expense of performance.

> Conditional variational models, using either continuous or discrete latent variables, are powerful for open-domain dialogue response generation. However, previous works show that continuous latent variables tend to reduce the coherence of generated responses. In this paper, we also found that discrete latent variables have difficulty capturing more diverse expressions. To tackle these problems, we combine the merits of both continuous and discrete latent variables and propose a Hybrid Latent Variable (HLV) method. Specifically, HLV constrains the global semantics of responses through discrete latent variables and enriches responses with continuous latent variables. Thus, we diversify the generated responses while maintaining relevance and coherence. In addition, we propose Conditional Hybrid Variational Transformer (CHVT) to construct and to utilize HLV with transformers for dialogue generation. Through fine-grained symbolic-level semantic information and additive Gaussian mixing, we construct the distribution of continuous variables, prompting the generation of diverse expressions. Meanwhile, to maintain the relevance and coherence, the discrete latent variable is optimized by self-separation training. Experimental results on two dialogue generation datasets (DailyDialog and Opensubtitles) show that CHVT is superior to traditional transformer-based variational mechanism w.r.t. diversity, relevance and coherence metrics. Moreover, we also demonstrate the benefit of applying HLV to fine-tuning two pre-trained dialogue models (PLATO and BART-base).

In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end trained transformer model which is capable of capturing long range spatiotemporal dependencies efficiently, contrary to existing approaches which use 3D-CNNs. Moreover, to address a common ambiguity in the existing works about classes that can be considered as previously unseen, we propose a new experimentation setup that satisfies the zero-shot learning premise for action recognition by avoiding overlap between the training and testing classes.

> Electrocardiography (ECG), an electrical measurement which captures cardiac activities, is the gold standard for diagnosing cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, ECG is infeasible for continuous cardiac monitoring due to its requirement for user participation. By contrast, photoplethysmography (PPG) provides easy-to-collect data, but its limited accuracy constrains its clinical usage. To combine the advantages of both signals, recent studies incorporate various deep learning techniques for the reconstruction of PPG signals to ECG; however, the lack of contextual information as well as the limited abilities to denoise biomedical signals ultimately constrain model performance. In this research, we propose Performer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that reconstructs ECG from PPG and combines the PPG and reconstructed ECG as multiple modalities for CVD detection. This method is the first time that Transformer sequence-to-sequence translation has been performed on biomedical waveform reconstruction, combining the advantages of both PPG and ECG. We also create Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA), an effective method to encode/decode the biomedical waveforms. Through fetching the various sequence lengths and capturing cross-patch connections, SPA maximizes the signal processing for both local features and global contextual representations. The proposed architecture generates a state-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for the reconstruction of PPG to ECG on the BIDMC database, surpassing prior studies. We also evaluated this model on the MIMIC-III dataset, achieving a 95.9% accuracy in CVD detection, and on the PPG-BP dataset, achieving 75.9% accuracy in related CVD diabetes detection, indicating its generalizability. As a proof of concept, an earring wearable named PEARL (prototype), was designed to scale up the point-of-care (POC) healthcare system.

> Following how humans communicate, free-text rationales aim to use natural language to explain neural language model (LM) behavior. However, free-text rationales' unconstrained nature makes them prone to hallucination, so it is important to have metrics for free-text rationale quality. Existing free-text rationale metrics measure how consistent the rationale is with the LM's predicted label, but there is no protocol for assessing such metrics' reliability. Thus, we propose FRAME, a framework for evaluating rationale-label consistency (RLC) metrics for free-text rationales. FRAME is based on three axioms: (1) good metrics should yield highest scores for reference rationales, which maximize RLC by construction; (2) good metrics should be appropriately sensitive to semantic perturbation of rationales; and (3) good metrics should be robust to variation in the LM's task performance. Across three text classification datasets, we show that existing RLC metrics cannot satisfy all three FRAME axioms, since they are implemented via model pretraining which muddles the metric's signal. Then, we introduce a non-pretraining RLC metric that greatly outperforms baselines on (1) and (3), while performing competitively on (2). Finally, we discuss the limitations of using RLC to evaluate free-text rationales.

> With the privatization deployment of DNNs on edge devices, the security of on-device DNNs has raised significant concern. To quantify the model leakage risk of on-device DNNs automatically, we propose NNReverse, the first learning-based method which can reverse DNNs from AI programs without domain knowledge. NNReverse trains a representation model to represent the semantics of binary code for DNN layers. By searching the most similar function in our database, NNReverse infers the layer type of a given function's binary code. To represent assembly instructions semantics precisely, NNReverse proposes a more fine-grained embedding model to represent the textual and structural-semantic of assembly functions.

To the best of our knowledge, MEDICO is the first-of-this-kind graph generative model that can generate molecular graphs similar to the structure of targeted molecules, with a multi-view representation learning framework to sufficiently and adaptively learn comprehensive structural semantics from targeted molecular topology and geometry. We show that our MEDICO significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating valid, unique, and novel molecules under benchmarking comparisons. In particular, we showcase the multi-view deep learning model enables us to generate not only the molecules structurally similar to the targeted molecules but also the molecules with desired chemical properties, demonstrating the strong capability of our model in exploring the chemical space deeply. Moreover, case study results on targeted molecule generation for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) show that by integrating molecule docking into our model as chemical priori, we successfully generate new small molecules with desired drug-like properties for the Mpro, potentially accelerating the de novo design of Covid-19 drugs. Further, we apply MEDICO to the structural optimization of three well-known Mpro inhibitors (N3, 11a, and GC376) and achieve ~88% improvement in their binding affinity to Mpro, demonstrating the application value of our model for the development of therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

> Ultra-fine entity typing (UFET) aims to predict a wide range of type phrases that correctly describe the categories of a given entity mention in a sentence. Most recent works infer each entity type independently, ignoring the correlations between types, e.g., when an entity is inferred as a president, it should also be a politician and a leader. To this end, we use an undirected graphical model called pairwise conditional random field (PCRF) to formulate the UFET problem, in which the type variables are not only unarily influenced by the input but also pairwisely relate to all the other type variables. We use various modern backbones for entity typing to compute unary potentials, and derive pairwise potentials from type phrase representations that both capture prior semantic information and facilitate accelerated inference. We use mean-field variational inference for efficient type inference on very large type sets and unfold it as a neural network module to enable end-to-end training. Experiments on UFET show that the Neural-PCRF consistently outperforms its backbones with little cost and results in a competitive performance against cross-encoder based SOTA while being thousands of times faster. We also find Neural- PCRF effective on a widely used fine-grained entity typing dataset with a smaller type set. We pack Neural-PCRF as a network module that can be plugged onto multi-label type classifiers with ease and release it in https://github.com/modelscope/adaseq/tree/master/examples/NPCRF.

> Automatic Program Repair (APR) aims at fixing buggy source code with less manual debugging efforts, which plays a vital role in improving software reliability and development productivity. Recent APR works have achieved remarkable progress via applying deep learning (DL), particularly neural machine translation (NMT) techniques. However, we observe that existing DL-based APR models suffer from at least two severe drawbacks: (1) Most of them can only generate patches for a single programming language, as a result, to repair multiple languages, we have to build and train many repairing models. (2) Most of them are developed in an offline manner. Therefore, they won't function when there are new-coming requirements. To address the above problems, a T5-based APR framework equipped with continual learning ability across multiple programming languages is proposed, namely \emph{C}ont\emph{I}nual \emph{R}epair a\emph{C}ross Programming \emph{L}anguag\emph{E}s (\emph{CIRCLE}). Specifically, (1) CIRCLE utilizes a prompting function to narrow the gap between natural language processing (NLP) pre-trained tasks and APR. (2) CIRCLE adopts a difficulty-based rehearsal strategy to achieve lifelong learning for APR without access to the full historical data. (3) An elastic regularization method is employed to strengthen CIRCLE's continual learning ability further, preventing it from catastrophic forgetting. (4) CIRCLE applies a simple but effective re-repairing method to revise generated errors caused by crossing multiple programming languages. We train CIRCLE for four languages (i.e., C, JAVA, JavaScript, and Python) and evaluate it on five commonly used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that CIRCLE not only effectively and efficiently repairs multiple programming languages in continual learning settings, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance with a single repair model.

> Interpretable entity representations (IERs) are sparse embeddings that are "human-readable" in that dimensions correspond to fine-grained entity types and values are predicted probabilities that a given entity is of the corresponding type. These methods perform well in zero-shot and low supervision settings. Compared to standard dense neural embeddings, such interpretable representations may permit analysis and debugging. However, while fine-tuning sparse, interpretable representations improves accuracy on downstream tasks, it destroys the semantics of the dimensions which were enforced in pre-training. Can we maintain the interpretable semantics afforded by IERs while improving predictive performance on downstream tasks? Toward this end, we propose Intermediate enTity-based Sparse Interpretable Representation Learning (ItsIRL). ItsIRL realizes improved performance over prior IERs on biomedical tasks, while maintaining "interpretability" generally and their ability to support model debugging specifically. The latter is enabled in part by the ability to perform "counterfactual" fine-grained entity type manipulation, which we explore in this work. Finally, we propose a method to construct entity type based class prototypes for revealing global semantic properties of classes learned by our model.

> Unavailability of parallel corpora for training text style transfer (TST) models is a very challenging yet common scenario. Also, TST models implicitly need to preserve the content while transforming a source sentence into the target style. To tackle these problems, an intermediate representation is often constructed that is devoid of style while still preserving the meaning of the source sentence. In this work, we study the usefulness of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph as the intermediate style agnostic representation. We posit that semantic notations like AMR are a natural choice for an intermediate representation. Hence, we propose T-STAR: a model comprising of two components, text-to-AMR encoder and a AMR-to-text decoder. We propose several modeling improvements to enhance the style agnosticity of the generated AMR. To the best of our knowledge, T-STAR is the first work that uses AMR as an intermediate representation for TST. With thorough experimental evaluation we show T-STAR significantly outperforms state of the art techniques by achieving on an average 15.2% higher content preservation with negligible loss (3% approx.) in style accuracy. Through detailed human evaluation with 90,000 ratings, we also show that T-STAR has up to 50% lesser hallucinations compared to state of the art TST models.

> Assigning appropriate industry tag(s) to a company is a critical task in a financial institution as it impacts various financial machineries. Yet, it remains a complex task. Typically, such industry tags are to be assigned by Subject Matter Experts (SME) after evaluating company business lines against the industry definitions. It becomes even more challenging as companies continue to add new businesses and newer industry definitions are formed. Given the periodicity of the task it is reasonable to assume that an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent could be developed to carry it out in an efficient manner. While this is an exciting prospect, the challenges appear from the need of historical patterns of such tag assignments (or Labeling). Labeling is often considered the most expensive task in Machine Learning (ML) due its dependency on SMEs and manual efforts. Therefore, often, in enterprise set up, an ML project encounters noisy and dependent labels. Such labels create technical hindrances for ML Models to produce robust tag assignments. We propose an ML pipeline which uses semantic similarity matching as an alternative to multi label text classification, while making use of a Label Similarity Matrix and a minimum labeling strategy. We demonstrate this pipeline achieves significant improvements over the noise and exhibit robust predictive capabilities.

> Ultrasound, because of its low cost, non-ionizing, and non-invasive characteristics, has established itself as a cornerstone radiological examination. Research on ultrasound applications has also expanded, especially with image analysis with machine learning. However, ultrasound data are frequently restricted to closed data sets, with only a few openly available. Despite being a frequently examined organ, the kidney lacks a publicly available ultrasonography data set. The proposed Open Kidney Ultrasound Data Set is the first publicly available set of kidney brightness mode (B-mode) ultrasound data that includes annotations for multi-class semantic segmentation. It is based on data retrospectively collected in a 5-year period from over 500 patients with a mean age of 53.2 +/- 14.7 years, body mass index of 27.0 +/- 5.4 kg/m2, and most common primary diseases being diabetes mellitus, immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, and hypertension. There are labels for the view and fine-grained manual annotations from two expert sonographers. Notably, this data includes native and transplanted kidneys. Initial bench-marking measurements are performed, demonstrating a state-of-the-art algorithm achieving a Dice Sorenson Coefficient of 0.85 for the kidney capsule. This data set is a high-quality data set, including two sets of expert annotations, with a larger breadth of images than previously available. In increasing access to kidney ultrasound data, future researchers may be able to create novel image analysis techniques for tissue characterization, disease detection, and prognostication.

> We want to verify the correctness of optimization phases in the GraalVM compiler, which consist of many thousands of lines of complex Java code performing sophisticated graph transformations. We have built high-level models of the data structures and operations of the code using the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, and can formally verify the correctness of those high-level operations. But the remaining challenge is: how can we be sure that those high-level operations accurately reflect what the Java is doing? This paper addresses that issue by applying several different kinds of differential testing to validate that the formal model and the Java code have the same semantics. Many of these validation techniques should be applicable to other projects that are building formal models of real-world code.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years and have achieved excellent performance in semi-supervised node classification tasks. The success of most GNNs relies on one fundamental assumption, i.e., the original graph structure data is available. However, recent studies have shown that GNNs are vulnerable to the complex underlying structure of the graph, making it necessary to learn comprehensive and robust graph structures for downstream tasks, rather than relying only on the raw graph structure. In light of this, we seek to learn optimal graph structures for downstream tasks and propose a novel framework for semi-supervised classification. Specifically, based on the structural context information of graph and node representations, we encode the complex interactions in semantics and generate semantic graphs to preserve the global structure. Moreover, we develop a novel multi-measure attention layer to optimize the similarity rather than prescribing it a priori, so that the similarity can be adaptively evaluated by integrating measures. These graphs are fused and optimized together with GNN towards semi-supervised classification objective. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on six real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and the contribution of each component.

> Multi-lingual language models (LM), such as mBERT, XLM-R, mT5, mBART, have been remarkably successful in enabling natural language tasks in low-resource languages through cross-lingual transfer from high-resource ones. In this work, we try to better understand how such models, specifically mT5, transfer *any* linguistic and semantic knowledge across languages, even though no explicit cross-lingual signals are provided during pre-training. Rather, only unannotated texts from each language are presented to the model separately and independently of one another, and the model appears to implicitly learn cross-lingual connections. This raises several questions that motivate our study, such as: Are the cross-lingual connections between every language pair equally strong? What properties of source and target language impact the strength of cross-lingual transfer? Can we quantify the impact of those properties on the cross-lingual transfer?   In our investigation, we analyze a pre-trained mT5 to discover the attributes of cross-lingual connections learned by the model. Through a statistical interpretation framework over 90 language pairs across three tasks, we show that transfer performance can be modeled by a few linguistic and data-derived features. These observations enable us to interpret cross-lingual understanding of the mT5 model. Through these observations, one can favorably choose the best source language for a task, and can anticipate its training data demands. A key finding of this work is that similarity of syntax, morphology and phonology are good predictors of cross-lingual transfer, significantly more than just the lexical similarity of languages. For a given language, we are able to predict zero-shot performance, that increases on a logarithmic scale with the number of few-shot target language data points.

> If scientific discovery is one of the main driving forces of human progress, insight is the fuel for the engine, which has long attracted behavior-level research to understand and model its underlying cognitive process. However, current tasks that abstract scientific discovery mostly focus on the emergence of insight, ignoring the special role played by domain knowledge. In this concept paper, we view scientific discovery as an interplay between $thinking \ out \ of \ the \ box$ that actively seeks insightful solutions and $thinking \ inside \ the \ box$ that generalizes on conceptual domain knowledge to keep correct. Accordingly, we propose Mindle, a semantic searching game that triggers scientific-discovery-like thinking spontaneously, as infrastructure for exploring scientific discovery on a large scale. On this basis, the meta-strategies for insights and the usage of concepts can be investigated reciprocally. In the pilot studies, several interesting observations inspire elaborated hypotheses on meta-strategies, context, and individual diversity for further investigations.

> The recent prevalence of pretrained language models (PLMs) has dramatically shifted the paradigm of semantic parsing, where the mapping from natural language utterances to structured logical forms is now formulated as a Seq2Seq task. Despite the promising performance, previous PLM-based approaches often suffer from hallucination problems due to their negligence of the structural information contained in the sentence, which essentially constitutes the key semantics of the logical forms. Furthermore, most works treat PLM as a black box in which the generation process of the target logical form is hidden beneath the decoder modules, which greatly hinders the model's intrinsic interpretability. To address these two issues, we propose to incorporate the current PLMs with a hierarchical decoder network. By taking the first-principle structures as the semantic anchors, we propose two novel intermediate supervision tasks, namely Semantic Anchor Extraction and Semantic Anchor Alignment, for training the hierarchical decoders and probing the model intermediate representations in a self-adaptive manner alongside the fine-tuning process. We conduct intensive experiments on several semantic parsing benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach can consistently outperform the baselines. More importantly, by analyzing the intermediate representations of the hierarchical decoders, our approach also makes a huge step toward the intrinsic interpretability of PLMs in the domain of semantic parsing.

> Pavement Distress Recognition (PDR) is an important step in pavement inspection and can be powered by image-based automation to expedite the process and reduce labor costs. Pavement images are often in high-resolution with a low ratio of distressed to non-distressed areas. Advanced approaches leverage these properties via dividing images into patches and explore discriminative features in the scale space. However, these approaches usually suffer from information loss during image resizing and low efficiency due to complex learning frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method for PDR. A light network named the Kernel Inversed Pyramidal Resizing Network (KIPRN) is introduced for image resizing, and can be flexibly plugged into the image classification network as a pre-network to exploit resolution and scale information. In KIPRN, pyramidal convolution and kernel inversed convolution are specifically designed to mine discriminative information across different feature granularities and scales. The mined information is passed along to the resized images to yield an informative image pyramid to assist the image classification network for PDR. We applied our method to three well-known Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and conducted an evaluation on a large-scale pavement image dataset named CQU-BPDD. Extensive results demonstrate that KIPRN can generally improve the pavement distress recognition of these CNN models and show that the simple combination of KIPRN and EfficientNet-B3 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art patch-based method in both performance and efficiency.

> We present the task of PreQuEL, Pre-(Quality-Estimation) Learning. A PreQuEL system predicts how well a given sentence will be translated, without recourse to the actual translation, thus eschewing unnecessary resource allocation when translation quality is bound to be low. PreQuEL can be defined relative to a given MT system (e.g., some industry service) or generally relative to the state-of-the-art. From a theoretical perspective, PreQuEL places the focus on the source text, tracing properties, possibly linguistic features, that make a sentence harder to machine translate.   We develop a baseline model for the task and analyze its performance. We also develop a data augmentation method (from parallel corpora), that improves results substantially. We show that this augmentation method can improve the performance of the Quality-Estimation task as well. We investigate the properties of the input text that our model is sensitive to, by testing it on challenge sets and different languages. We conclude that it is aware of syntactic and semantic distinctions, and correlates and even over-emphasizes the importance of standard NLP features.

> Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently drawn much research interest for learning generalizable node representations in a self-supervised manner. In general, the contrastive learning process in GCL is performed on top of the representations learned by a graph neural network (GNN) backbone, which transforms and propagates the node contextual information based on its local neighborhoods. However, nodes sharing similar characteristics may not always be geographically close, which poses a great challenge for unsupervised GCL efforts due to their inherent limitations in capturing such global graph knowledge. In this work, we address their inherent limitations by proposing a simple yet effective framework -- Simple Neural Networks with Structural and Semantic Contrastive Learning} (S^3-CL). Notably, by virtue of the proposed structural and semantic contrastive learning algorithms, even a simple neural network can learn expressive node representations that preserve valuable global structural and semantic patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the node representations learned by S^3-CL achieve superior performance on different downstream tasks compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised GCL methods. Implementation and more experimental details are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/kaize0409/S-3-CL.}

> DataFlow has been emerging as a new paradigm for building task-oriented chatbots due to its expressive semantic representations of the dialogue tasks. Despite the availability of a large dataset SMCalFlow and a simplified syntax, the development and evaluation of DataFlow-based chatbots remain challenging due to the system complexity and the lack of downstream toolchains. In this demonstration, we present DFEE, an interactive DataFlow Execution and Evaluation toolkit that supports execution, visualization and benchmarking of semantic parsers given dialogue input and backend database. We demonstrate the system via a complex dialog task: event scheduling that involves temporal reasoning. It also supports diagnosing the parsing results via a friendly interface that allows developers to examine dynamic DataFlow and the corresponding execution results. To illustrate how to benchmark SoTA models, we propose a novel benchmark that covers more sophisticated event scheduling scenarios and a new metric on task success evaluation. The codes of DFEE have been released on https://github.com/amazonscience/dataflow-evaluation-toolkit.

> Background: The renaming of program identifiers is the most common refactoring operation. Because some identifiers are related to each other, developers may need to rename related identifiers together. Aims: To understand how developers rename multiple identifiers simultaneously, it is necessary to consider the relationships between identifiers in the program and the brief matching for non-identical but semantically similar identifiers. Method: We investigate the relationships between co-renamed identifiers and identify the types of their relationships that contribute to improving the recommendation using more than 1M of renaming instances collected from the histories of open-source software projects. We also evaluate and compare the impact of co-renaming and the relationships between identifiers when inflections occur in the words in identifiers are taken into account. Results: We revealed several relationships of identifiers that are frequently found in the co-renamed identifiers, such as the identifiers of methods in the same class or an identifier defining a variable and another used for initializing the variable, depending on the type of the renamed identifiers. Additionally, the consideration of inflections did not affect the tendency of the relationships. Conclusion: These results suggest an approach that prioritizes the identifiers to be recommended depending on their types and the type of the renamed identifier.

> Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL) identifies arguments and labels them with frame semantic roles defined in FrameNet. Previous researches tend to divide FSRL into argument identification and role classification. Such methods usually model role classification as naive multi-class classification and treat arguments individually, which neglects label semantics and interactions between arguments and thus hindering performance and generalization of models. In this paper, we propose a query-based framework named ArGument Extractor with Definitions in FrameNet (AGED) to mitigate these problems. Definitions of frames and frame elements (FEs) in FrameNet can be used to query arguments in text. Encoding text-definition pairs can guide models in learning label semantics and strengthening argument interactions. Experiments show that AGED outperforms previous state-of-the-art by up to 1.3 F1-score in two FrameNet datasets and the generalization power of AGED in zero-shot and fewshot scenarios. Our code and technical appendix is available at https://github.com/PKUnlp-icler/AGED.

> A critical challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) is for multiple agents to efficiently accomplish complex, long-horizon tasks. The agents often have difficulties in cooperating on common goals, dividing complex tasks, and planning through several stages to make progress. We propose to address these challenges by guiding agents with programs designed for parallelization, since programs as a representation contain rich structural and semantic information, and are widely used as abstractions for long-horizon tasks. Specifically, we introduce Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Parallel Program Guidance(E-MAPP), a novel framework that leverages parallel programs to guide multiple agents to efficiently accomplish goals that require planning over $10+$ stages. E-MAPP integrates the structural information from a parallel program, promotes the cooperative behaviors grounded in program semantics, and improves the time efficiency via a task allocator. We conduct extensive experiments on a series of challenging, long-horizon cooperative tasks in the Overcooked environment. Results show that E-MAPP outperforms strong baselines in terms of the completion rate, time efficiency, and zero-shot generalization ability by a large margin.

> Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) aims to extract relational tuples from open-domain sentences. Traditional rule-based or statistical models have been developed based on syntactic structures of sentences, identified by syntactic parsers. However, previous neural OpenIE models under-explore the useful syntactic information. In this paper, we model both constituency and dependency trees into word-level graphs, and enable neural OpenIE to learn from the syntactic structures. To better fuse heterogeneous information from both graphs, we adopt multi-view learning to capture multiple relationships from them. Finally, the finetuned constituency and dependency representations are aggregated with sentential semantic representations for tuple generation. Experiments show that both constituency and dependency information, and the multi-view learning are effective.

> Video-language modeling has attracted much attention with the rapid growth of web videos. Most existing methods assume that the video frames and text description are semantically correlated, and focus on video-language modeling at video level. However, this hypothesis often fails for two reasons: (1) With the rich semantics of video contents, it is difficult to cover all frames with a single video-level description; (2) A raw video typically has noisy/meaningless information (e.g., scenery shot, transition or teaser). Although a number of recent works deploy attention mechanism to alleviate this problem, the irrelevant/noisy information still makes it very difficult to address. To overcome such challenge, we thus propose an efficient and effective model, termed Language-Guided Denoising Network (LGDN), for video-language modeling. Different from most existing methods that utilize all extracted video frames, LGDN dynamically filters out the misaligned or redundant frames under the language supervision and obtains only 2--4 salient frames per video for cross-modal token-level alignment. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show that our LGDN outperforms the state-of-the-arts by large margins. We also provide detailed ablation study to reveal the critical importance of solving the noise issue, in hope of inspiring future video-language work.

A common issue is that the errors resulting from noisy utterances, semantic misunderstandings, or lack of knowledge make it hard for a real system to respond properly, possibly leading to an unsatisfactory user experience. To avoid such a case, we consider a proactive interaction mechanism where the system predicts the user satisfaction with the candidate response before giving it to the user. If the user is not likely to be satisfied according to the prediction, the system will ask the user a suitable question to determine the real intent of the user instead of providing the response directly. With such an interaction with the user, the system can give a better response to the user. Previous models that predict the user satisfaction are not applicable to DuerOS which is a large-scale commercial dialogue system. They are based on hand-crafted features and thus can hardly learn the complex patterns lying behind millions of conversations and temporal dependency in multiple turns of the conversation. Moreover, they are trained and evaluated on the benchmark datasets with adequate labels, which are expensive to obtain in a commercial dialogue system. To face these challenges, we propose a pipeline to predict the user satisfaction to help DuerOS decide whether to ask for clarification in each turn. Specifically, we propose to first generate a large number of weak labels and then train a transformer-based model to predict the user satisfaction with these weak labels. Empirically, we deploy and evaluate our model on DuerOS, and observe a 19% relative improvement on the accuracy of user satisfaction prediction and 2.3% relative improvement on user experience.

> Federated Deep Learning frameworks can be used strategically to monitor Land Use locally and infer environmental impacts globally. Distributed data from across the world would be needed to build a global model for Land Use classification. The need for a Federated approach in this application domain would be to avoid transfer of data from distributed locations and save network bandwidth to reduce communication cost. We use a Federated UNet model for Semantic Segmentation of satellite and street view images. The novelty of the proposed architecture is the integration of Knowledge Distillation to reduce communication cost and response time. The accuracy obtained was above 95% and we also brought in a significant model compression to over 17 times and 62 times for street View and satellite images respectively. Our proposed framework has the potential to be a game-changer in real-time tracking of climate change across the planet.

> Human-technology collaboration relies on verbal and non-verbal communication. Machines must be able to detect and understand the movements of humans to facilitate non-verbal communication. In this article, we introduce ongoing research on human activity recognition in intralogistics, and show how it can be applied in industrial settings. We show how semantic attributes can be used to describe human activities flexibly and how context informantion increases the performance of classifiers to recognise them automatically. Beyond that, we present a concept based on a cyber-physical twin that can reduce the effort and time necessary to create a training dataset for human activity recognition. In the future, it will be possible to train a classifier solely with realistic simulation data, while maintaining or even increasing the classification performance.

> We launch EVA, a vision-centric foundation model to explore the limits of visual representation at scale using only publicly accessible data. EVA is a vanilla ViT pre-trained to reconstruct the masked out image-text aligned vision features conditioned on visible image patches. Via this pretext task, we can efficiently scale up EVA to one billion parameters, and sets new records on a broad range of representative vision downstream tasks, such as image recognition, video action recognition, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation without heavy supervised training. Moreover, we observe quantitative changes in scaling EVA result in qualitative changes in transfer learning performance that are not present in other models. For instance, EVA takes a great leap in the challenging large vocabulary instance segmentation task: our model achieves almost the same state-of-the-art performance on LVISv1.0 dataset with over a thousand categories and COCO dataset with only eighty categories. Beyond a pure vision encoder, EVA can also serve as a vision-centric, multi-modal pivot to connect images and text. We find initializing the vision tower of a giant CLIP from EVA can greatly stabilize the training and outperform the training from scratch counterpart with much fewer samples and less compute, providing a new direction for scaling up and accelerating the costly training of multi-modal foundation models. To facilitate future research, we release all the code and models at https://github.com/baaivision/EVA.

> Efficient ObjectGoal navigation (ObjectNav) in novel environments requires an understanding of the spatial and semantic regularities in environment layouts. In this work, we present a straightforward method for learning these regularities by predicting the locations of unobserved objects from incomplete semantic maps. Our method differs from previous prediction-based navigation methods, such as frontier potential prediction or egocentric map completion, by directly predicting unseen targets while leveraging the global context from all previously explored areas. Our prediction model is lightweight and can be trained in a supervised manner using a relatively small amount of passively collected data. Once trained, the model can be incorporated into a modular pipeline for ObjectNav without the need for any reinforcement learning. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the HM3D and MP3D ObjectNav datasets. We find that it achieves the state-of-the-art on both datasets, despite not using any additional data for training.

> Knowledge about outcomes is critical for complex event understanding but is hard to acquire. We show that by pre-identifying a participant in a complex event, crowd workers are able to (1) infer the collective impact of salient events that make up the situation, (2) annotate the volitional engagement of participants in causing the situation, and (3) ground the outcome of the situation in state changes of the participants. By creating a multi-step interface and a careful quality control strategy, we collect a high quality annotated dataset of 8K short newswire narratives and ROCStories with high inter-annotator agreement (0.74-0.96 weighted Fleiss Kappa). Our dataset, POQue (Participant Outcome Questions), enables the exploration and development of models that address multiple aspects of semantic understanding. Experimentally, we show that current language models lag behind human performance in subtle ways through our task formulations that target abstract and specific comprehension of a complex event, its outcome, and a participant's influence over the event culmination.

> Deploying AI-powered systems requires trustworthy models supporting effective human interactions, going beyond raw prediction accuracy. Concept bottleneck models promote trustworthiness by conditioning classification tasks on an intermediate level of human-like concepts. This enables human interventions which can correct mispredicted concepts to improve the model's performance. However, existing concept bottleneck models are unable to find optimal compromises between high task accuracy, robust concept-based explanations, and effective interventions on concepts -- particularly in real-world conditions where complete and accurate concept supervisions are scarce. To address this, we propose Concept Embedding Models, a novel family of concept bottleneck models which goes beyond the current accuracy-vs-interpretability trade-off by learning interpretable high-dimensional concept representations. Our experiments demonstrate that Concept Embedding Models (1) attain better or competitive task accuracy w.r.t. standard neural models without concepts, (2) provide concept representations capturing meaningful semantics including and beyond their ground truth labels, (3) support test-time concept interventions whose effect in test accuracy surpasses that in standard concept bottleneck models, and (4) scale to real-world conditions where complete concept supervisions are scarce.

> Vision transformer has demonstrated great potential in abundant vision tasks. However, it also inevitably suffers from poor generalization capability when the distribution shift occurs in testing (i.e., out-of-distribution data). To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel method, Semantic-aware Message Broadcasting (SAMB), which enables more informative and flexible feature alignment for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Particularly, we study the attention module in the vision transformer and notice that the alignment space using one global class token lacks enough flexibility, where it interacts information with all image tokens in the same manner but ignores the rich semantics of different regions. In this paper, we aim to improve the richness of the alignment features by enabling semantic-aware adaptive message broadcasting. Particularly, we introduce a group of learned group tokens as nodes to aggregate the global information from all image tokens, but encourage different group tokens to adaptively focus on the message broadcasting to different semantic regions. In this way, our message broadcasting encourages the group tokens to learn more informative and diverse information for effective domain alignment. Moreover, we systematically study the effects of adversarial-based feature alignment (ADA) and pseudo-label based self-training (PST) on UDA. We find that one simple two-stage training strategy with the cooperation of ADA and PST can further improve the adaptation capability of the vision transformer. Extensive experiments on DomainNet, OfficeHome, and VisDA-2017 demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for UDA.

> This paper solves a generalized version of the problem of multi-source model adaptation for semantic segmentation. Model adaptation is proposed as a new domain adaptation problem which requires access to a pre-trained model instead of data for the source domain. A general multi-source setting of model adaptation assumes strictly that each source domain shares a common label space with the target domain. As a relaxation, we allow the label space of each source domain to be a subset of that of the target domain and require the union of the source-domain label spaces to be equal to the target-domain label space. For the new setting named union-set multi-source model adaptation, we propose a method with a novel learning strategy named model-invariant feature learning, which takes full advantage of the diverse characteristics of the source-domain models, thereby improving the generalization in the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments in various adaptation settings to show the superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/lzy7976/union-set-model-adaptation.

> In this work, we propose a semantic flow-guided two-stage framework for shape-aware face swapping, namely FlowFace. Unlike most previous methods that focus on transferring the source inner facial features but neglect facial contours, our FlowFace can transfer both of them to a target face, thus leading to more realistic face swapping. Concretely, our FlowFace consists of a face reshaping network and a face swapping network. The face reshaping network addresses the shape outline differences between the source and target faces. It first estimates a semantic flow (i.e., face shape differences) between the source and the target face, and then explicitly warps the target face shape with the estimated semantic flow. After reshaping, the face swapping network generates inner facial features that exhibit the identity of the source face. We employ a pre-trained face masked autoencoder (MAE) to extract facial features from both the source face and the target face. In contrast to previous methods that use identity embedding to preserve identity information, the features extracted by our encoder can better capture facial appearances and identity information. Then, we develop a cross-attention fusion module to adaptively fuse inner facial features from the source face with the target facial attributes, thus leading to better identity preservation. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on in-the-wild faces demonstrate that our FlowFace outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly.

> Understanding the variations in trading price (volatility), and its response to exogenous information, is a well-researched topic in finance. In this study, we focus on finding stable and accurate volatility predictors for a relatively new asset class of cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoin, using deep learning representations of public social media data obtained from Twitter. For our experiments, we extracted semantic information and user statistics from over 30 million Bitcoin-related tweets, in conjunction with 15-minute frequency price data over a horizon of 144 days. Using this data, we built several deep learning architectures that utilized different combinations of the gathered information. For each model, we conducted ablation studies to assess the influence of different components and feature sets over the prediction accuracy. We found statistical evidences for the hypotheses that: (i) temporal convolutional networks perform significantly better than both classical autoregressive models and other deep learning-based architectures in the literature, and (ii) tweet author meta-information, even detached from the tweet itself, is a better predictor of volatility than the semantic content and tweet volume statistics. We demonstrate how different information sets gathered from social media can be utilized in different architectures and how they affect the prediction results. As an additional contribution, we make our dataset public for future research.

> Causal Emotion Entailment aims to identify causal utterances that are responsible for the target utterance with a non-neutral emotion in conversations. Previous works are limited in thorough understanding of the conversational context and accurate reasoning of the emotion cause. To this end, we propose Knowledge-Bridged Causal Interaction Network (KBCIN) with commonsense knowledge (CSK) leveraged as three bridges. Specifically, we construct a conversational graph for each conversation and leverage the event-centered CSK as the semantics-level bridge (S-bridge) to capture the deep inter-utterance dependencies in the conversational context via the CSK-Enhanced Graph Attention module. Moreover, social-interaction CSK serves as emotion-level bridge (E-bridge) and action-level bridge (A-bridge) to connect candidate utterances with the target one, which provides explicit causal clues for the Emotional Interaction module and Actional Interaction module to reason the target emotion. Experimental results show that our model achieves better performance over most baseline models. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/circle-hit/KBCIN.

> Defects increase the cost and duration of construction projects as they require significant inspection and documentation efforts. Automating defect detection could significantly reduce these efforts. This work focuses on detecting honeycombs, a substantial defect in concrete structures that may affect structural integrity. We compared honeycomb images scraped from the web with images obtained from real construction inspections. We found that web images do not capture the complete variance found in real-case scenarios and that there is still a lack of data in this domain. Our dataset is therefore freely available for further research. A Mask R-CNN and EfficientNet-B0 were trained for honeycomb detection. The Mask R-CNN model allows detecting honeycombs based on instance segmentation, whereas the EfficientNet-B0 model allows a patch-based classification. Our experiments demonstrate that both approaches are suitable for solving and automating honeycomb detection. In the future, this solution can be incorporated into defect documentation systems.

> Recent advances on text-to-image generation have witnessed the rise of diffusion models which act as powerful generative models. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to exploit such latent variable models to capture the dependency among discrete words and meanwhile pursue complex visual-language alignment in image captioning. In this paper, we break the deeply rooted conventions in learning Transformer-based encoder-decoder, and propose a new diffusion model based paradigm tailored for image captioning, namely Semantic-Conditional Diffusion Networks (SCD-Net). Technically, for each input image, we first search the semantically relevant sentences via cross-modal retrieval model to convey the comprehensive semantic information. The rich semantics are further regarded as semantic prior to trigger the learning of Diffusion Transformer, which produces the output sentence in a diffusion process. In SCD-Net, multiple Diffusion Transformer structures are stacked to progressively strengthen the output sentence with better visional-language alignment and linguistical coherence in a cascaded manner. Furthermore, to stabilize the diffusion process, a new self-critical sequence training strategy is designed to guide the learning of SCD-Net with the knowledge of a standard autoregressive Transformer model. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate the promising potential of using diffusion models in the challenging image captioning task.

> In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-domain translation: given an element $a$ of domain $A$, we would like to generate a corresponding $b$ sample in another domain $B$, and vice versa. Acquiring supervision in multiple domains can be a tedious task, also we propose to learn this translation from one domain to another when supervision is available as a pair $(a,b)\sim A\times B$ and leveraging possible unpaired data when only $a\sim A$ or only $b\sim B$ is available. We introduce a new unified framework called Latent Space Mapping (\model) that exploits the manifold assumption in order to learn, from each domain, a latent space. Unlike existing approaches, we propose to further regularize each latent space using available domains by learning each dependency between pairs of domains. We evaluate our approach in three tasks performing i) synthetic dataset with image translation, ii) real-world task of semantic segmentation for medical images, and iii) real-world task of facial landmark detection.

> Simulating physical network paths (e.g., Internet) is a cornerstone research problem in the emerging sub-field of AI-for-networking.

The problem setting is unique, and renders the state-of-the-art text and time-series generative models inapplicable or ineffective. We formulate an ML problem at the intersection of dynamical systems, sequential decision making, and time-series modeling. We propose a novel grey-box approach to network simulation that embeds the semantics of physical network path in a new RNN-style model called RBU, providing the interpretability of standard network simulator tools, the power of neural models, the efficiency of SGD-based techniques for learning, and yielding promising results on synthetic and real-world network traces.

> Tens of thousands of engineers use Sourcegraph day-to-day to search for code and rely on it to make progress on software development tasks. We face a key challenge in designing a query language that accommodates the needs of a broad spectrum of users. Our experience shows that users express different and often contradictory preferences for how queries should be interpreted. These preferences stem from users with differing usage contexts, technical experience, and implicit expectations from using prior tools. At the same time, designing a code search query language poses unique challenges because it intersects traditional search engines and full-fledged programming languages. For example, code search queries adopt certain syntactic conventions in the interest of simplicity and terseness but invariably risk encoding implicit semantics that are ambiguous at face-value (a single space in a query could mean three or more semantically different things depending on surrounding terms). Users often need to disambiguate intent with additional syntax so that a query expresses what they actually want to search. This need to disambiguate is one of the primary frustrations we've seen users experience with writing search queries in the last three years. We share our observations that lead us to a fresh perspective where code search behavior can straddle seemingly ambiguous queries. We develop Automated Query Evaluation (AQE), a new technique that automatically generates and adaptively runs alternative query interpretations in frustration-prone conditions. We evaluate AQE with an A/B test across more than 10,000 unique users on our publicly-available code search instance. Our main result shows that relative to the control group, users are on average 22% more likely to click on a search result at all on any given day when AQE is active.

> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated superiority in learning patterns, but are sensitive to label noises and may overfit noisy labels during training. The early stopping strategy averts updating CNNs during the early training phase and is widely employed in the presence of noisy labels. Motivated by biological findings that the amplitude spectrum (AS) and phase spectrum (PS) in the frequency domain play different roles in the animal's vision system, we observe that PS, which captures more semantic information, can increase the robustness of DNNs to label noise, more so than AS can. We thus propose early stops at different times for AS and PS by disentangling the features of some layer(s) into AS and PS using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) during training. Our proposed Phase-AmplituDe DisentangLed Early Stopping (PADDLES) method is shown to be effective on both synthetic and real-world label-noise datasets. PADDLES outperforms other early stopping methods and obtains state-of-the-art performance.

> Software-related platforms have enabled their users to collaboratively label software entities with topics. Tagging software repositories with relevant topics can be exploited for facilitating various downstream tasks. For instance, a correct and complete set of topics assigned to a repository can increase its visibility. Consequently, this improves the outcome of tasks such as browsing, searching, navigation, and organization of repositories. Unfortunately, assigned topics are usually highly noisy, and some repositories do not have well-assigned topics. Thus, there have been efforts on recommending topics for software projects, however, the semantic relationships among these topics have not been exploited so far.   We propose two recommender models for tagging software projects that incorporate the semantic relationship among topics. Our approach has two main phases; (1) we first take a collaborative approach to curate a dataset of quality topics specifically for the domain of software engineering and development. We also enrich this data with the semantic relationships among these topics and encapsulate them in a knowledge graph we call SED-KGraph. Then, (2) we build two recommender systems; The first one operates only based on the list of original topics assigned to a repository and the relationships specified in our knowledge graph. The second predictive model, however, assumes there are no topics available for a repository, hence it proceeds to predict the relevant topics based on both textual information of a software project and SED-KGraph.   We built SED-KGraph in a crowd-sourced project with 170 contributors from both academia and industry. The experiment results indicate that our solutions outperform baselines that neglect the semantic relationships among topics by at least 25% and 23% in terms of ASR and MAP metrics.

> Compared to traditional visual question answering, video-grounded dialogues require additional reasoning over dialogue context to answer questions in a multi-turn setting. Previous approaches to video-grounded dialogues mostly use dialogue context as a simple text input without modelling the inherent information flows at the turn level. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Reasoning Paths in Dialogue Context (PDC). PDC model discovers information flows among dialogue turns through a semantic graph constructed based on lexical components in each question and answer. PDC model then learns to predict reasoning paths over this semantic graph. Our path prediction model predicts a path from the current turn through past dialogue turns that contain additional visual cues to answer the current question. Our reasoning model sequentially processes both visual and textual information through this reasoning path and the propagated features are used to generate the answer. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and provide additional insights on how models use semantic dependencies in a dialogue context to retrieve visual cues.

> Large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles has been continually delayed due to safety concerns. On the one hand, comprehensive scene understanding is indispensable, a lack of which would result in vulnerability to rare but complex traffic situations, such as the sudden emergence of unknown objects. However, reasoning from a global context requires access to sensors of multiple types and adequate fusion of multi-modal sensor signals, which is difficult to achieve. On the other hand, the lack of interpretability in learning models also hampers the safety with unverifiable failure causes. In this paper, we propose a safety-enhanced autonomous driving framework, named Interpretable Sensor Fusion Transformer(InterFuser), to fully process and fuse information from multi-modal multi-view sensors for achieving comprehensive scene understanding and adversarial event detection. Besides, intermediate interpretable features are generated from our framework, which provide more semantics and are exploited to better constrain actions to be within the safe sets. We conducted extensive experiments on CARLA benchmarks, where our model outperforms prior methods, ranking the first on the public CARLA Leaderboard. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/opendilab/InterFuser

> Many challenges from natural world can be formulated as a graph matching problem. Previous deep learning-based methods mainly consider a full two-graph matching setting. In this work, we study the more general partial matching problem with multi-graph cycle consistency guarantees. Building on a recent progress in deep learning on graphs, we propose a novel data-driven method (URL) for partial multi-graph matching, which uses an object-to-universe formulation and learns latent representations of abstract universe points. The proposed approach advances the state of the art in semantic keypoint matching problem, evaluated on Pascal VOC, CUB, and Willow datasets. Moreover, the set of controlled experiments on a synthetic graph matching dataset demonstrates the scalability of our method to graphs with large number of nodes and its robustness to high partiality.

> This paper explores a better prediction target for BERT pre-training of vision transformers. We observe that current prediction targets disagree with human perception judgment.This contradiction motivates us to learn a perceptual prediction target. We argue that perceptually similar images should stay close to each other in the prediction target space. We surprisingly find one simple yet effective idea: enforcing perceptual similarity during the dVAE training. Moreover, we adopt a self-supervised transformer model for deep feature extraction and show that it works well for calculating perceptual similarity.We demonstrate that such learned visual tokens indeed exhibit better semantic meanings, and help pre-training achieve superior transfer performance in various downstream tasks. For example, we achieve $\textbf{84.5\%}$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B backbone, outperforming the competitive method BEiT by $\textbf{+1.3\%}$ under the same pre-training epochs. Our approach also gets significant improvement on object detection and segmentation on COCO and semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Equipped with a larger backbone ViT-H, we achieve the state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy (\textbf{88.3\%}) among methods using only ImageNet-1K data.

> We present a self-supervised learning (SSL) method suitable for semi-global tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. We enforce local consistency between self-learned features, representing corresponding image locations of transformed versions of the same image, by minimizing a pixel-level local contrastive (LC) loss during training. LC-loss can be added to existing self-supervised learning methods with minimal overhead. We evaluate our SSL approach on two downstream tasks -- object detection and semantic segmentation, using COCO, PASCAL VOC, and CityScapes datasets. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art SSL approaches by 1.9% on COCO object detection, 1.4% on PASCAL VOC detection, and 0.6% on CityScapes segmentation.

> Well-annotated medical datasets enable deep neural networks (DNNs) to gain strong power in extracting lesion-related features. Building such large and well-designed medical datasets is costly due to the need for high-level expertise. Model pre-training based on ImageNet is a common practice to gain better generalization when the data amount is limited. However, it suffers from the domain gap between natural and medical images. In this work, we pre-train DNNs on ultrasound (US) domains instead of ImageNet to reduce the domain gap in medical US applications. To learn US image representations based on unlabeled US videos, we propose a novel meta-learning-based contrastive learning method, namely Meta Ultrasound Contrastive Learning (Meta-USCL). To tackle the key challenge of obtaining semantically consistent sample pairs for contrastive learning, we present a positive pair generation module along with an automatic sample weighting module based on meta-learning. Experimental results on multiple computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) problems, including pneumonia detection, breast cancer classification, and breast tumor segmentation, show that the proposed self-supervised method reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA). The codes are available at https://github.com/Schuture/Meta-USCL.

> Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) combines OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies with Horn Logic rules of the Rule Markup Language (RuleML) family. Being supported by ontology editors, rule engines and ontology reasoners, it has become a very popular choice for developing rule-based applications on top of ontologies. However, SWRL is probably not go-ing to become a WWW Consortium standard, prohibiting industrial acceptance. On the other hand, SPIN (SPARQL Inferencing Notation) has become a de-facto industry standard to rep-resent SPARQL rules and constraints on Semantic Web models, building on the widespread acceptance of SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). In this paper, we ar-gue that the life of existing SWRL rule-based ontology applications can be prolonged by con-verting them to SPIN. To this end, we have developed the SWRL2SPIN tool in Prolog that transforms SWRL rules into SPIN rules, considering the object-orientation of SPIN, i.e. linking rules to the appropriate ontology classes and optimizing them, as derived by analysing the rule conditions.

> Recent advances in Named Entity Recognition (NER) show that document-level contexts can significantly improve model performance. In many application scenarios, however, such contexts are not available. In this paper, we propose to find external contexts of a sentence by retrieving and selecting a set of semantically relevant texts through a search engine, with the original sentence as the query. We find empirically that the contextual representations computed on the retrieval-based input view, constructed through the concatenation of a sentence and its external contexts, can achieve significantly improved performance compared to the original input view based only on the sentence. Furthermore, we can improve the model performance of both input views by Cooperative Learning, a training method that encourages the two input views to produce similar contextual representations or output label distributions. Experiments show that our approach can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on 8 NER data sets across 5 domains.

> State-of-the-art pretrained contextualized models (PCM) eg. BERT use tasks such as WiC and WSD to evaluate their word-in-context representations. This inherently assumes that performance in these tasks reflect how well a model represents the coupled word and context semantics. We question this assumption by presenting the first quantitative analysis on the context-word interaction being tested in major contextual lexical semantic tasks. To achieve this, we run probing baselines on masked input, and propose measures to calculate and visualize the degree of context or word biases in existing datasets. The analysis was performed on both models and humans. Our findings demonstrate that models are usually not being tested for word-in-context semantics in the same way as humans are in these tasks, which helps us better understand the model-human gap. Specifically, to PCMs, most existing datasets fall into the extreme ends (the retrieval-based tasks exhibit strong target word bias while WiC-style tasks and WSD show strong context bias); In comparison, humans are less biased and achieve much better performance when both word and context are available than with masked input. We recommend our framework for understanding and controlling these biases for model interpretation and future task design.

> The paradigm shift of enabling extensive intercommunication between the Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) devices allows vulnerabilities typical to the IT world to propagate to the OT side. Therefore, the security layer offered in the past by air gapping is removed, making security patching for OT devices a hard requirement. Conventional patching involves a device reboot to load the patched code in the main memory, which does not apply to OT devices controlling critical processes due to downtime, necessitating in-memory vulnerability patching. Furthermore, these control binaries are often compiled by in-house proprietary compilers, further hindering the patching process and placing reliance on OT vendors for rapid vulnerability discovery and patch development. The current state-of-the-art hotpatching approaches only focus on firmware and/or RTOS. Therefore, in this work, we develop ICSPatch, a framework to automate control logic vulnerability localization using Data Dependence Graphs (DDGs). With the help of DDGs, ICSPatch pinpoints the vulnerability in the control application. As an independent second step, ICSPatch can non-intrusively hotpatch vulnerabilities in the control application directly in the main memory of Programmable Logic Controllers while maintaining reliable continuous operation. To evaluate our framework, we test ICSPatch on a synthetic dataset of 24 vulnerable control application binaries from diverse critical infrastructure sectors. Results show that ICSPatch could successfully localize all vulnerabilities and generate patches accordingly. Furthermore, the patch added negligible latency increase in the execution cycle while maintaining correctness and protection against the vulnerability.

- `2212.04262v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04262v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04262v1)

> Transfer learning is a simple and powerful method that can be used to boost model performance of low-resource neural machine translation (NMT). Existing transfer learning methods for NMT are static, which simply transfer knowledge from a parent model to a child model once via parameter initialization. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for NMT, namely ConsistTL, which can continuously transfer knowledge from the parent model during the training of the child model. Specifically, for each training instance of the child model, ConsistTL constructs the semantically-equivalent instance for the parent model and encourages prediction consistency between the parent and child for this instance, which is equivalent to the child model learning each instance under the guidance of the parent model. Experimental results on five low-resource NMT tasks demonstrate that ConsistTL results in significant improvements over strong transfer learning baselines, with a gain up to 1.7 BLEU over the existing back-translation model on the widely-used WMT17 Turkish-English benchmark. Further analysis reveals that ConsistTL can improve the inference calibration of the child model. Code and scripts are freely available at https://github.com/NLP2CT/ConsistTL.

> Current state-of-the-art segmentation techniques for ocular images are critically dependent on large-scale annotated datasets, which are labor-intensive to gather and often raise privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a novel framework, called BiOcularGAN, capable of generating synthetic large-scale datasets of photorealistic (visible light and near-infrared) ocular images, together with corresponding segmentation labels to address these issues. At its core, the framework relies on a novel Dual-Branch StyleGAN2 (DB-StyleGAN2) model that facilitates bimodal image generation, and a Semantic Mask Generator (SMG) component that produces semantic annotations by exploiting latent features of the DB-StyleGAN2 model. We evaluate BiOcularGAN through extensive experiments across five diverse ocular datasets and analyze the effects of bimodal data generation on image quality and the produced annotations. Our experimental results show that BiOcularGAN is able to produce high-quality matching bimodal images and annotations (with minimal manual intervention) that can be used to train highly competitive (deep) segmentation models (in a privacy aware-manner) that perform well across multiple real-world datasets. The source code for the BiOcularGAN framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/BiOcularGAN.

> Large-scale diffusion neural networks represent a substantial milestone in text-to-image generation, but they remain poorly understood, lacking interpretability analyses. In this paper, we perform a text-image attribution analysis on Stable Diffusion, a recently open-sourced model. To produce pixel-level attribution maps, we upscale and aggregate cross-attention word-pixel scores in the denoising subnetwork, naming our method DAAM. We evaluate its correctness by testing its semantic segmentation ability on nouns, as well as its generalized attribution quality on all parts of speech, rated by humans. We then apply DAAM to study the role of syntax in the pixel space, characterizing head--dependent heat map interaction patterns for ten common dependency relations. Finally, we study several semantic phenomena using DAAM, with a focus on feature entanglement, where we find that cohyponyms worsen generation quality and descriptive adjectives attend too broadly. To our knowledge, we are the first to interpret large diffusion models from a visuolinguistic perspective, which enables future lines of research. Our code is at https://github.com/castorini/daam.

> Training embodied agents in simulation has become mainstream for the embodied AI community. However, these agents often struggle when deployed in the physical world due to their inability to generalize to real-world environments. In this paper, we present Phone2Proc, a method that uses a 10-minute phone scan and conditional procedural generation to create a distribution of training scenes that are semantically similar to the target environment. The generated scenes are conditioned on the wall layout and arrangement of large objects from the scan, while also sampling lighting, clutter, surface textures, and instances of smaller objects with randomized placement and materials. Leveraging just a simple RGB camera, training with Phone2Proc shows massive improvements from 34.7% to 70.7% success rate in sim-to-real ObjectNav performance across a test suite of over 200 trials in diverse real-world environments, including homes, offices, and RoboTHOR. Furthermore, Phone2Proc's diverse distribution of generated scenes makes agents remarkably robust to changes in the real world, such as human movement, object rearrangement, lighting changes, or clutter.

> Recent works on diffusion models have demonstrated a strong capability for conditioning image generation, e.g., text-guided image synthesis. Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation. The code is available for research purposes at https://github.com/zhang-zx/SINE.git .

> Classifiers and generators have long been separated. We break down this separation and showcase that conventional neural network classifiers can generate high-quality images of a large number of categories, being comparable to the state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., DDPMs and GANs). We achieve this by computing the partial derivative of the classification loss function with respect to the input to optimize the input to produce an image. Since it is widely known that directly optimizing the inputs is similar to targeted adversarial attacks incapable of generating human-meaningful images, we propose a mask-based stochastic reconstruction module to make the gradients semantic-aware to synthesize plausible images. We further propose a progressive-resolution technique to guarantee fidelity, which produces photorealistic images. Furthermore, we introduce a distance metric loss and a non-trivial distribution loss to ensure classification neural networks can synthesize diverse and high-fidelity images. Using traditional neural network classifiers, we can generate good-quality images of 256$\times$256 resolution on ImageNet. Intriguingly, our method is also applicable to text-to-image generation by regarding image-text foundation models as generalized classifiers.   Proving that classifiers have learned the data distribution and are ready for image generation has far-reaching implications, for classifiers are much easier to train than generative models like DDPMs and GANs. We don't even need to train classification models because tons of public ones are available for download. Also, this holds great potential for the interpretability and robustness of classifiers.

> Industrial and commercial ports, which are one of the three main hubs to the country, require 24/7 operations to maintain the goods export and import flow. Due to the aging and weather factors, berths require regular maintenance, such as replacing old piles, timber finders, marine ladders, rubber fenders, and deck slabs. For efficient berth maintenance, strategies are highly desired to minimize or eliminate any delays in operations during the maintenance. This paper develops a discrete event simulation model using Simphony.NET for berth maintenance processes in Doha Port, Kuwait. The model derives minimum maintenance duration under limited resources and associated uncertainties. The model can be used as a decision support tool to minimize interruption or delays in the port maintenance operations.

> We propose a transition-based system to transpile Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) into SPARQL for Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA). This allows us to delegate part of the semantic representation to a strongly pre-trained semantic parser, while learning transpiling with small amount of paired data. We depart from recent work relating AMR and SPARQL constructs, but rather than applying a set of rules, we teach a BART model to selectively use these relations. Further, we avoid explicitly encoding AMR but rather encode the parser state in the attention mechanism of BART, following recent semantic parsing works. The resulting model is simple, provides supporting text for its decisions, and outperforms recent approaches in KBQA across two knowledge bases: DBPedia (LC-QuAD 1.0, QALD-9) and Wikidata (WebQSP, SWQ-WD).

> We propose a data-driven mean-curvature solver for the level-set method. This work is the natural extension to $\mathbb{R}^3$ of our two-dimensional strategy in [DOI: 10.1007/s10915-022-01952-2][1] and the hybrid inference system of [DOI: 10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111291][2]. However, in contrast to [1,2], which built resolution-dependent neural-network dictionaries, here we develop a pair of models in $\mathbb{R}^3$, regardless of the mesh size. Our feedforward networks ingest transformed level-set, gradient, and curvature data to fix numerical mean-curvature approximations selectively for interface nodes. To reduce the problem's complexity, we have used the Gaussian curvature to classify stencils and fit our models separately to non-saddle and saddle patterns. Non-saddle stencils are easier to handle because they exhibit a curvature error distribution characterized by monotonicity and symmetry. While the latter has allowed us to train only on half the mean-curvature spectrum, the former has helped us blend the data-driven and the baseline estimations seamlessly near flat regions. On the other hand, the saddle-pattern error structure is less clear; thus, we have exploited no latent information beyond what is known. In this regard, we have trained our models on not only spherical but also sinusoidal and hyperbolic paraboloidal patches. Our approach to building their data sets is systematic but gleans samples randomly while ensuring well-balancedness. We have also resorted to standardization and dimensionality reduction and integrated regularization to minimize outliers. In addition, we leverage curvature rotation/reflection invariance to improve precision at inference time. Several experiments confirm that our proposed system can yield more accurate mean-curvature estimations than modern particle-based interface reconstruction and level-set schemes around under-resolved regions.

> Automated GUI testing is widely used to help ensure the quality of mobile apps. However, many GUIs require appropriate text inputs to proceed to the next page which remains a prominent obstacle for testing coverage. Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool.

Our experiments elucidate the inherent discrepancies between the general- and clinical-domain texts, and suggest that entity-centric contrastive approaches may help bridge this gap and lead to a better representation of clinical sentences.

> Existing methods for large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation require expensive, tedious and error-prone manual point-wise annotations. Intuitively, weakly supervised training is a direct solution to reduce the cost of labeling. However, for weakly supervised large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation, too few annotations will inevitably lead to ineffective learning of network. We propose an effective weakly supervised method containing two components to solve the above problem. Firstly, we construct a pretext task, \textit{i.e.,} point cloud colorization, with a self-supervised learning to transfer the learned prior knowledge from a large amount of unlabeled point cloud to a weakly supervised network. In this way, the representation capability of the weakly supervised network can be improved by the guidance from a heterogeneous task. Besides, to generate pseudo label for unlabeled data, a sparse label propagation mechanism is proposed with the help of generated class prototypes, which is used to measure the classification confidence of unlabeled point. Our method is evaluated on large-scale point cloud datasets with different scenarios including indoor and outdoor. The experimental results show the large gain against existing weakly supervised and comparable results to fully supervised methods\footnote{Code based on mindspore: https://github.com/dmcv-ecnu/MindSpore\_ModelZoo/tree/main/WS3\_MindSpore}.

> International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a set of classification codes for medical records. Automated ICD coding, which assigns unique International Classification of Diseases codes with each medical record, is widely used recently for its efficiency and error-prone avoidance. However, there are challenges that remain such as heterogeneity, label unbalance, and complex relationships between ICD codes. In this work, we proposed a novel Bidirectional Hierarchy Framework(HieNet) to address the challenges. Specifically, a personalized PageRank routine is developed to capture the co-relation of codes, a bidirectional hierarchy passage encoder to capture the codes' hierarchical representations, and a progressive predicting method is then proposed to narrow down the semantic searching space of prediction. We validate our method on two widely used datasets. Experimental results on two authoritative public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method boosts state-of-the-art performance by a large margin.

> Recently, neural language representation models pre-trained on large corpus can capture rich co-occurrence information and be fine-tuned in downstream tasks to improve the performance. As a result, they have achieved state-of-the-art results in a large range of language tasks. However, there exists other valuable semantic information such as similar, opposite, or other possible meanings in external knowledge graphs (KGs). We argue that entities in KGs could be used to enhance the correct semantic meaning of language sentences. In this paper, we propose a new method CKG: Dynamic Representation Based on \textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{G}raph. On the one side, CKG can extract rich semantic information of large corpus. On the other side, it can make full use of inside information such as co-occurrence in large corpus and outside information such as similar entities in KGs. We conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of tasks, including QQP, MRPC, SST-5, SQuAD, CoNLL 2003, and SNLI. The experiment results show that CKG achieves SOTA 89.2 on SQuAD compared with SAN (84.4), ELMo (85.8), and BERT$_{Base}$ (88.5).

> Recently, language representation techniques have achieved great performances in text classification. However, most existing representation models are specifically designed for English materials, which may fail in Chinese because of the huge difference between these two languages. Actually, few existing methods for Chinese text classification process texts at a single level. However, as a special kind of hieroglyphics, radicals of Chinese characters are good semantic carriers. In addition, Pinyin codes carry the semantic of tones, and Wubi reflects the stroke structure information, \textit{etc}. Unfortunately, previous researches neglected to find an effective way to distill the useful parts of these four factors and to fuse them. In our works, we propose a novel model called Moto: Enhancing Embedding with \textbf{M}ultiple J\textbf{o}int Fac\textbf{to}rs. Specifically, we design an attention mechanism to distill the useful parts by fusing the four-level information above more effectively. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular tasks. The empirical results show that our Moto achieves SOTA 0.8316 ($F_1$-score, 2.11\% improvement) on Chinese news titles, 96.38 (1.24\% improvement) on Fudan Corpus and 0.9633 (3.26\% improvement) on THUCNews.

> Previous studies have explored generating accurately lip-synced talking faces for arbitrary targets given audio conditions. However, most of them deform or generate the whole facial area, leading to non-realistic results. In this work, we delve into the formulation of altering only the mouth shapes of the target person. This requires masking a large percentage of the original image and seamlessly inpainting it with the aid of audio and reference frames. To this end, we propose the Audio-Visual Context-Aware Transformer (AV-CAT) framework, which produces accurate lip-sync with photo-realistic quality by predicting the masked mouth shapes. Our key insight is to exploit desired contextual information provided in audio and visual modalities thoroughly with delicately designed Transformers. Specifically, we propose a convolution-Transformer hybrid backbone and design an attention-based fusion strategy for filling the masked parts. It uniformly attends to the textural information on the unmasked regions and the reference frame. Then the semantic audio information is involved in enhancing the self-attention computation. Additionally, a refinement network with audio injection improves both image and lip-sync quality. Extensive experiments validate that our model can generate high-fidelity lip-synced results for arbitrary subjects.

> Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the globe, but not necessarily Spanish is written and spoken in the same way in different countries. Understanding local language variations can help to improve model performances on regional tasks, both understanding local structures and also improving the message's content. For instance, think about a machine learning engineer who automatizes some language classification task on a particular region or a social scientist trying to understand a regional event with echoes on social media; both can take advantage of dialect-based language models to understand what is happening with more contextual information hence more precision.   This manuscript presents and describes a set of regionalized resources for the Spanish language built on four-year Twitter public messages geotagged in 26 Spanish-speaking countries. We introduce word embeddings based on FastText, language models based on BERT, and per-region sample corpora. We also provide a broad comparison among regions covering lexical and semantical similarities; as well as examples of using regional resources on message classification tasks.

> The most useful data mining primitives are distance measures. With an effective distance measure, it is possible to perform classification, clustering, anomaly detection, segmentation, etc. For single-event time series Euclidean Distance and Dynamic Time Warping distance are known to be extremely effective. However, for time series containing cyclical behaviors, the semantic meaningfulness of such comparisons is less clear. For example, on two separate days the telemetry from an athlete workout routine might be very similar. The second day may change the order in of performing push-ups and squats, adding repetitions of pull-ups, or completely omitting dumbbell curls. Any of these minor changes would defeat existing time series distance measures. Some bag-of-features methods have been proposed to address this problem, but we argue that in many cases, similarity is intimately tied to the shapes of subsequences within these longer time series. In such cases, summative features will lack discrimination ability. In this work we introduce PRCIS, which stands for Pattern Representation Comparison in Series. PRCIS is a distance measure for long time series, which exploits recent progress in our ability to summarize time series with dictionaries. We will demonstrate the utility of our ideas on diverse tasks and datasets.

> In this paper, we propose a control synthesis method for signal temporal logic (STL) specifications with neural networks (NNs). Most of the previous works consider training a controller for only a given STL specification. These approaches, however, require retraining the NN controller if a new specification arises and needs to be satisfied, which results in large consumption of memory and inefficient training. To tackle this problem, we propose to construct NN controllers by introducing encoder-decoder structured NNs with an attention mechanism. The encoder takes an STL formula as input and encodes it into an appropriate vector, and the decoder outputs control signals that will meet the given specification. As the encoder, we consider three NN structures: sequential, tree-structured, and graph-structured NNs. All the model parameters are trained in an end-to-end manner to maximize the expected robustness that is known to be a quantitative semantics of STL formulae. We compare the control performances attained by the above NN structures through a numerical experiment of the path planning problem, showing the efficacy of the proposed approach.

> We introduce OPEND, a benchmark for learning how to use a hand to open cabinet doors or drawers in a photo-realistic and physics-reliable simulation environment driven by language instruction. To solve the task, we propose a multi-step planner composed of a deep neural network and rule-base controllers. The network is utilized to capture spatial relationships from images and understand semantic meaning from language instructions. Controllers efficiently execute the plan based on the spatial and semantic understanding. We evaluate our system by measuring its zero-shot performance in test data set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of decision planning by our multi-step planner for different hands, while suggesting that there is significant room for developing better models to address the challenge brought by language understanding, spatial reasoning, and long-term manipulation. We will release OPEND and host challenges to promote future research in this area.

> Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enable agents to learn complex tasks. However, it is difficult to interpret the knowledge and reuse it across tasks. Inductive biases can address such issues by explicitly providing generic yet useful decomposition that is otherwise difficult or expensive to learn implicitly. For example, object-centered approaches decompose a high dimensional observation into individual objects. Expanding on this, we utilize an inductive bias for explicit object-centered knowledge separation that provides further decomposition into semantic representations and dynamics knowledge. For this, we introduce a semantic module that predicts an objects' semantic state based on its context. The resulting affordance-like object state can then be used to enrich perceptual object representations. With a minimal setup and an environment that enables puzzle-like tasks, we demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of this approach. Specifically, we compare three different methods of integrating semantic representations into a model-based RL architecture. Our experiments show that the degree of explicitness in knowledge separation correlates with faster learning, better accuracy, better generalization, and better interpretability.

> Numerous analysis methods for quantitative attack tree analysis have been proposed. These algorithms compute relevant security metrics, i.e. performance indicators that quantify how good the security of a system is; typical metrics being the most likely attack, the cheapest, or the most damaging one. However, existing methods are only geared towards specific metrics or do not work on general attack trees. This paper classifies attack trees in two dimensions: proper trees vs. directed acyclic graphs (i.e. with shared subtrees); and static vs. dynamic gates. For three out of these four classes, we propose novel algorithms that work over a generic attribute domain, encompassing a large number of concrete security metrics defined on the attack tree semantics; dynamic attack trees with directed acyclic graph structure are left as an open problem. We also analyse the computational complexity of our methods.

> Contrastive learning has become a new paradigm for unsupervised sentence embeddings. Previous studies focus on instance-wise contrastive learning, attempting to construct positive pairs with textual data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive learning method with Prompt-derived Virtual semantic Prototypes (ConPVP). Specifically, with the help of prompts, we construct virtual semantic prototypes to each instance, and derive negative prototypes by using the negative form of the prompts. Using a prototypical contrastive loss, we enforce the anchor sentence embedding to be close to its corresponding semantic prototypes, and far apart from the negative prototypes as well as the prototypes of other sentences. Extensive experimental results on semantic textual similarity, transfer, and clustering tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to strong baselines.

> The success of graph neural networks on graph-based web mining highly relies on abundant human-annotated data, which is laborious to obtain in practice. When only few labeled nodes are available, how to improve their robustness is a key to achieve replicable and sustainable graph semi-supervised learning. Though self-training has been shown to be powerful for semi-supervised learning, its application on graph-structured data may fail because (1) larger receptive fields are not leveraged to capture long-range node interactions, which exacerbates the difficulty of propagating feature-label patterns from labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes; and (2) limited labeled data makes it challenging to learn well-separated decision boundaries for different node classes without explicitly capturing the underlying semantic structure. To address the challenges of capturing informative structural and semantic knowledge, we propose a new graph data augmentation framework, AGST (Augmented Graph Self-Training), which is built with two new (i.e., structural and semantic) augmentation modules on top of a decoupled GST backbone. In this work, we investigate whether this novel framework can learn a robust graph predictive model under the low-data context. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on semi-supervised node classification under different scenarios of limited labeled-node data. The experimental results demonstrate the unique contributions of the novel data augmentation framework for node classification with few labeled data.

> While there is a large body of work on analyzing concurrency related software bugs and developing techniques for detecting and patching them, little attention has been given to concurrency related security vulnerabilities. The two are different in that not all bugs are vulnerabilities: for a bug to be exploitable, there needs be a way for attackers to trigger its execution and cause damage, e.g., by revealing sensitive data or running malicious code. To fill the gap, we conduct the first empirical study of concurrency vulnerabilities reported in the Linux operating system in the past ten years. We focus on analyzing the confirmed vulnerabilities archived in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, which are then categorized into different groups based on bug types, exploit patterns, and patch strategies adopted by developers. We use code snippets to illustrate individual vulnerability types and patch strategies. We also use statistics to illustrate the entire landscape, including the percentage of each vulnerability type. We hope to shed some light on the problem, e.g., concurrency vulnerabilities continue to pose a serious threat to system security, and it is difficult even for kernel developers to analyze and patch them. Therefore, more efforts are needed to develop tools and techniques for analyzing and patching these vulnerabilities.

> A large number of annotated video-caption pairs are required for training video captioning models, resulting in high annotation costs. Active learning can be instrumental in reducing these annotation requirements. However, active learning for video captioning is challenging because multiple semantically similar captions are valid for a video, resulting in high entropy outputs even for less-informative samples. Moreover, video captioning algorithms are multimodal in nature with a visual encoder and language decoder. Further, the sequential and combinatorial nature of the output makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we introduce MAViC which leverages our proposed Multimodal Semantics Aware Sequential Entropy (M-SASE) based acquisition function to address the challenges of active learning approaches for video captioning. Our approach integrates semantic similarity and uncertainty of both visual and language dimensions in the acquisition function. Our detailed experiments empirically demonstrate the efficacy of M-SASE for active learning for video captioning and improve on the baselines by a large margin.

> Image-text retrieval in remote sensing aims to provide flexible information for data analysis and application. In recent years, state-of-the-art methods are dedicated to ``scale decoupling'' and ``semantic decoupling'' strategies to further enhance the capability of representation. However, these previous approaches focus on either the disentangling scale or semantics but ignore merging these two ideas in a union model, which extremely limits the performance of cross-modal retrieval models. To address these issues, we propose a novel Scale-Semantic Joint Decoupling Network (SSJDN) for remote sensing image-text retrieval. Specifically, we design the Bidirectional Scale Decoupling (BSD) module, which exploits Salience Feature Extraction (SFE) and Salience-Guided Suppression (SGS) units to adaptively extract potential features and suppress cumbersome features at other scales in a bidirectional pattern to yield different scale clues. Besides, we design the Label-supervised Semantic Decoupling (LSD) module by leveraging the category semantic labels as prior knowledge to supervise images and texts probing significant semantic-related information. Finally, we design a Semantic-guided Triple Loss (STL), which adaptively generates a constant to adjust the loss function to improve the probability of matching the same semantic image and text and shorten the convergence time of the retrieval model. Our proposed SSJDN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in numerical experiments conducted on four benchmark remote sensing datasets.

> Page layout analysis is a fundamental step in document processing which enables to segment a page into regions of interest. With highly complex layouts and mixed scripts, scholarly commentaries are text-heavy documents which remain challenging for state-of-the-art models. Their layout considerably varies across editions and their most important regions are mainly defined by semantic rather than graphical characteristics such as position or appearance. This setting calls for a comparison between textual, visual and hybrid approaches. We therefore assess the performances of two transformers (LayoutLMv3 and RoBERTa) and an objection-detection network (YOLOv5). If results show a clear advantage in favor of the latter, we also list several caveats to this finding. In addition to our experiments, we release a dataset of ca. 300 annotated pages sampled from 19th century commentaries.

> Reverse engineers benefit from the presence of identifiers such as function names in a binary, but usually these are removed for release. Training a machine learning model to predict function names automatically is promising but fundamentally hard: unlike words in natural language, most function names occur only once. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing eXtreme Function Labeling (XFL), an extreme multi-label learning approach to selecting appropriate labels for binary functions. XFL splits function names into tokens, treating each as an informative label akin to the problem of tagging texts in natural language. We relate the semantics of binary code to labels through DEXTER, a novel function embedding that combines static analysis-based features with local context from the call graph and global context from the entire binary. We demonstrate that XFL/DEXTER outperforms the state of the art in function labeling on a dataset of 10,047 binaries from the Debian project, achieving a precision of 83.5%. We also study combinations of XFL with alternative binary embeddings from the literature and show that DEXTER consistently performs best for this task. As a result, we demonstrate that binary function labeling can be effectively phrased in terms of multi-label learning, and that binary function embeddings benefit from including explicit semantic features.

> Although deep networks have shown vulnerability to evasion attacks, such attacks have usually unrealistic requirements. Recent literature discussed the possibility to remove or not some of these requirements. This paper contributes to this literature by introducing a carpet-bombing patch attack which has almost no requirement. Targeting the feature representations, this patch attack does not require knowing the network task. This attack decreases accuracy on Imagenet, mAP on Pascal Voc, and IoU on Cityscapes without being aware that the underlying tasks involved classification, detection or semantic segmentation, respectively. Beyond the potential safety issues raised by this attack, the impact of the carpet-bombing attack highlights some interesting property of deep network layer dynamic.

> To curb the problem of false information, social media platforms like Twitter started adding warning labels to content discussing debunked narratives, with the goal of providing more context to their audiences. Unfortunately, these labels are not applied uniformly and leave large amounts of false content unmoderated. This paper presents LAMBRETTA, a system that automatically identifies tweets that are candidates for soft moderation using Learning To Rank (LTR). We run LAMBRETTA on Twitter data to moderate false claims related to the 2020 US Election and find that it flags over 20 times more tweets than Twitter, with only 3.93% false positives and 18.81% false negatives, outperforming alternative state-of-the-art methods based on keyword extraction and semantic search. Overall, LAMBRETTA assists human moderators in identifying and flagging false information on social media.

> Realistic synthetic image data rendered from 3D models can be used to augment image sets and train image classification semantic segmentation models. In this work, we explore how high quality physically-based rendering and domain randomization can efficiently create a large synthetic dataset based on production 3D CAD models of a real vehicle. We use this dataset to quantify the effectiveness of synthetic augmentation using U-net and Double-U-net models. We found that, for this domain, synthetic images were an effective technique for augmenting limited sets of real training data. We observed that models trained on purely synthetic images had a very low mean prediction IoU on real validation images. We also observed that adding even very small amounts of real images to a synthetic dataset greatly improved accuracy, and that models trained on datasets augmented with synthetic images were more accurate than those trained on real images alone. Finally, we found that in use cases that benefit from incremental training or model specialization, pretraining a base model on synthetic images provided a sizeable reduction in the training cost of transfer learning, allowing up to 90\% of the model training to be front-loaded.

> The publication time of a document carries a relevant information about its semantic content. The Dirichlet-Hawkes process has been proposed to jointly model textual information and publication dynamics. This approach has been used with success in several recent works, and extended to tackle specific challenging problems --typically for short texts or entangled publication dynamics. However, the prior in its current form does not allow for complex publication dynamics. In particular, inferred topics are independent from each other --a publication about finance is assumed to have no influence on publications about politics, for instance.   In this work, we develop the Multivariate Powered Dirichlet-Hawkes Process (MPDHP), that alleviates this assumption. Publications about various topics can now influence each other. We detail and overcome the technical challenges that arise from considering interacting topics. We conduct a systematic evaluation of MPDHP on a range of synthetic datasets to define its application domain and limitations. Finally, we develop a use case of the MPDHP on Reddit data. At the end of this article, the interested reader will know how and when to use MPDHP, and when not to.

> Semantic communication (SemCom) and edge computing are two disruptive solutions to address emerging requirements of huge data communication, bandwidth efficiency and low latency data processing in Metaverse. However, edge computing resources are often provided by computing service providers and thus it is essential to design appealingly incentive mechanisms for the provision of limited resources. Deep learning (DL)- based auction has recently proposed as an incentive mechanism that maximizes the revenue while holding important economic properties, i.e., individual rationality and incentive compatibility. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the design of the DLbased auction for the computing resource allocation in SemComenabled Metaverse. First, we briefly introduce the fundamentals and challenges of Metaverse. Second, we present the preliminaries of SemCom and edge computing. Third, we review various incentive mechanisms for edge computing resource trading. Fourth, we present the design of the DL-based auction for edge resource allocation in SemCom-enabled Metaverse. Simulation results demonstrate that the DL-based auction improves the revenue while nearly satisfying the individual rationality and incentive compatibility constraints.

> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with U-shaped architectures have dominated medical image segmentation, which is crucial for various clinical purposes. However, the inherent locality of convolution makes CNNs fail to fully exploit global context, essential for better recognition of some structures, e.g., brain lesions. Transformers have recently proven promising performance on vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, mainly due to their capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of attention makes existing Transformer-based models use self-attention layers only after somehow reducing the image resolution, which limits the ability to capture global contexts present at higher resolutions. Therefore, this work introduces a family of models, dubbed Factorizer, which leverages the power of low-rank matrix factorization for constructing an end-to-end segmentation model. Specifically, we propose a linearly scalable approach to context modeling, formulating Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as a differentiable layer integrated into a U-shaped architecture. The shifted window technique is also utilized in combination with NMF to effectively aggregate local information. Factorizers compete favorably with CNNs and Transformers in terms of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art results on the BraTS dataset for brain tumor segmentation and ISLES'22 dataset for stroke lesion segmentation. Highly meaningful NMF components give an additional interpretability advantage to Factorizers over CNNs and Transformers. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal a distinctive feature of Factorizers that enables a significant speed-up in inference for a trained Factorizer without any extra steps and without sacrificing much accuracy. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/pashtari/factorizer.

> Whole-slide images (WSI) in computational pathology have high resolution with gigapixel size, but are generally with sparse regions of interest, which leads to weak diagnostic relevance and data inefficiency for each area in the slide. Most of the existing methods rely on a multiple instance learning framework that requires densely sampling local patches at high magnification. The limitation is evident in the application stage as the heavy computation for extracting patch-level features is inevitable. In this paper, we develop RLogist, a benchmarking deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for fast observation strategy on WSIs. Imitating the diagnostic logic of human pathologists, our RL agent learns how to find regions of observation value and obtain representative features across multiple resolution levels, without having to analyze each part of the WSI at the high magnification. We benchmark our method on two whole-slide level classification tasks, including detection of metastases in WSIs of lymph node sections, and subtyping of lung cancer. Experimental results demonstrate that RLogist achieves competitive classification performance compared to typical multiple instance learning algorithms, while having a significantly short observation path. In addition, the observation path given by RLogist provides good decision-making interpretability, and its ability of reading path navigation can potentially be used by pathologists for educational/assistive purposes.

> Zero-shot relation triplet extraction (ZeroRTE) aims to extract relation triplets from unstructured texts under the zero-shot setting, where the relation sets at the training and testing stages are disjoint. Previous state-of-the-art method handles this challenging task by leveraging pretrained language models to generate data as additional training samples, which increases the training cost and severely constrains the model performance. To address the above issues, we propose a novel method named PCRED for ZeroRTE with Potential Candidate Relation Selection and Entity Boundary Detection. The remarkable characteristic of PCRED is that it does not rely on additional data and still achieves promising performance. The model adopts a relation-first paradigm, recognizing unseen relations through candidate relation selection. With this approach, the semantics of relations are naturally infused in the context. Entities are extracted based on the context and the semantics of relations subsequently. We evaluate our model on two ZeroRTE datasets. The experiment results show that our method consistently outperforms previous works. Our code will be available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PCRED.

> Zero-shot learning (ZSL) tackles the novel class recognition problem by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Existing attention-based models have struggled to learn inferior region features in a single image by solely using unidirectional attention, which ignore the transferability and discriminative attribute localization of visual features. In this paper, we propose a cross attribute-guided Transformer network, termed TransZero++, to refine visual features and learn accurate attribute localization for semantic-augmented visual embedding representations in ZSL. TransZero++ consists of an attribute$\rightarrow$visual Transformer sub-net (AVT) and a visual$\rightarrow$attribute Transformer sub-net (VAT). Specifically, AVT first takes a feature augmentation encoder to alleviate the cross-dataset problem, and improves the transferability of visual features by reducing the entangled relative geometry relationships among region features. Then, an attribute$\rightarrow$visual decoder is employed to localize the image regions most relevant to each attribute in a given image for attribute-based visual feature representations. Analogously, VAT uses the similar feature augmentation encoder to refine the visual features, which are further applied in visual$\rightarrow$attribute decoder to learn visual-based attribute features. By further introducing semantical collaborative losses, the two attribute-guided transformers teach each other to learn semantic-augmented visual embeddings via semantical collaborative learning. Extensive experiments show that TransZero++ achieves the new state-of-the-art results on three challenging ZSL benchmarks.

> Patch-based models, e.g., Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Mixers, have shown impressive results on various visual recognition tasks, alternating classic convolutional networks. While the initial patch-based models (ViTs) treated all patches equally, recent studies reveal that incorporating inductive bias like spatiality benefits the representations. However, most prior works solely focused on the location of patches, overlooking the scene structure of images. Thus, we aim to further guide the interaction of patches using the object information. Specifically, we propose OAMixer (object-aware mixing layer), which calibrates the patch mixing layers of patch-based models based on the object labels. Here, we obtain the object labels in unsupervised or weakly-supervised manners, i.e., no additional human-annotating cost is necessary. Using the object labels, OAMixer computes a reweighting mask with a learnable scale parameter that intensifies the interaction of patches containing similar objects and applies the mask to the patch mixing layers. By learning an object-centric representation, we demonstrate that OAMixer improves the classification accuracy and background robustness of various patch-based models, including ViTs, MLP-Mixers, and ConvMixers. Moreover, we show that OAMixer enhances various downstream tasks, including large-scale classification, self-supervised learning, and multi-object recognition, verifying the generic applicability of OAMixer

> The current trajectory privacy protection technology only considers the temporal and spatial attributes of trajectory data, but ignores the social attributes. However, there is an intrinsic relationship between social attributes and human activity trajectories, which brings new challenges to trajectory privacy protection, making existing trajectory privacy protection technologies unable to resist trajectory privacy attacks based on social attributes. To this end, this paper first studies the social privacy attack in the trajectory data, builds a social privacy attack model based on the fusion of "space-time" features, and reveals the internal impact of the spatial and temporal features in the trajectory data on social privacy leaks. -Anonymous algorithm and trajectory release privacy protection provide theoretical support. On this basis, integrate social attributes into trajectory privacy protection technology, design trajectory k-anonymity algorithm based on "space-time-social" three-dimensional mobile model, and construct trajectory data based on "space-time-social-semantic" multi-dimensional correlation Publish privacy-preserving models.

> We discuss two kinds of semantics relevant to Computer Vision (CV) systems - Visual Semantics and Lexical Semantics. While visual semantics focus on how humans build concepts when using vision to perceive a target reality, lexical semantics focus on how humans build concepts of the same target reality through the use of language. The lack of coincidence between visual and lexical semantics, in turn, has a major impact on CV systems in the form of the Semantic Gap Problem (SGP). The paper, while extensively exemplifying the lack of coincidence as above, introduces a general, domain-agnostic methodology to enforce alignment between visual and lexical semantics.

> This thesis develops the translation between category theory and computational linguistics as a foundation for natural language processing. The three chapters deal with syntax, semantics and pragmatics. First, string diagrams provide a unified model of syntactic structures in formal grammars. Second, functors compute semantics by turning diagrams into logical, tensor, neural or quantum computation. Third, the resulting functorial models can be composed to form games where equilibria are the solutions of language processing tasks. This framework is implemented as part of DisCoPy, the Python library for computing with string diagrams. We describe the correspondence between categorical, linguistic and computational structures, and demonstrate their applications in compositional natural language processing.

> Pre-training by numerous image data has become de-facto for robust 2D representations. In contrast, due to the expensive data acquisition and annotation, a paucity of large-scale 3D datasets severely hinders the learning for high-quality 3D features. In this paper, we propose an alternative to obtain superior 3D representations from 2D pre-trained models via Image-to-Point Masked Autoencoders, named as I2P-MAE. By self-supervised pre-training, we leverage the well learned 2D knowledge to guide 3D masked autoencoding, which reconstructs the masked point tokens with an encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we first utilize off-the-shelf 2D models to extract the multi-view visual features of the input point cloud, and then conduct two types of image-to-point learning schemes on top. For one, we introduce a 2D-guided masking strategy that maintains semantically important point tokens to be visible for the encoder. Compared to random masking, the network can better concentrate on significant 3D structures and recover the masked tokens from key spatial cues. For another, we enforce these visible tokens to reconstruct the corresponding multi-view 2D features after the decoder. This enables the network to effectively inherit high-level 2D semantics learned from rich image data for discriminative 3D modeling. Aided by our image-to-point pre-training, the frozen I2P-MAE, without any fine-tuning, achieves 93.4% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, competitive to the fully trained results of existing methods. By further fine-tuning on on ScanObjectNN's hardest split, I2P-MAE attains the state-of-the-art 90.11% accuracy, +3.68% to the second-best, demonstrating superior transferable capacity. Code will be available at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/I2P-MAE.

> Adversarial images are created with the intention of causing an image classifier to produce a misclassification. In this paper, we propose that adversarial images should be evaluated based on semantic mismatch, rather than label mismatch, as used in current work. In other words, we propose that an image of a "mug" would be considered adversarial if classified as "turnip", but not as "cup", as current systems would assume. Our novel idea of taking semantic misclassification into account in the evaluation of adversarial images offers two benefits. First, it is a more realistic conceptualization of what makes an image adversarial, which is important in order to fully understand the implications of adversarial images for security and privacy. Second, it makes it possible to evaluate the transferability of adversarial images to a real-world classifier, without requiring the classifier's label set to have been available during the creation of the images. The paper carries out an evaluation of a transfer attack on a real-world image classifier that is made possible by our semantic misclassification approach. The attack reveals patterns in the semantics of adversarial misclassifications that could not be investigated using conventional label mismatch.

> Metaverse over wireless networks is an emerging use case of the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, posing unprecedented challenges in terms of its multi-modal data transmissions with stringent latency and reliability requirements. Towards enabling this wireless metaverse, in this article we propose a novel semantic communication (SC) framework by decomposing the metaverse into human/machine agent-specific semantic multiverses (SMs). An SM stored at each agent comprises a semantic encoder and a generator, leveraging recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI). To improve communication efficiency, the encoder learns the semantic representations (SRs) of multi-modal data, while the generator learns how to manipulate them for locally rendering scenes and interactions in the metaverse. Since these learned SMs are biased towards local environments, their success hinges on synchronizing heterogeneous SMs in the background while communicating SRs in the foreground, turning the wireless metaverse problem into the problem of semantic multiverse communication (SMC). Based on this SMC architecture, we propose several promising algorithmic and analytic tools for modeling and designing SMC, ranging from distributed learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to signaling games and symbolic AI.

> Human reading comprehension often requires reasoning of event semantic relations in narratives, represented by Event-centric Question-Answering (QA). To address event-centric QA, we propose a novel QA model with contrastive learning and invertible event transformation, call TranCLR. Our proposed model utilizes an invertible transformation matrix to project semantic vectors of events into a common event embedding space, trained with contrastive learning, and thus naturally inject event semantic knowledge into mainstream QA pipelines. The transformation matrix is fine-tuned with the annotated event relation types between events that occurred in questions and those in answers, using event-aware question vectors. Experimental results on the Event Semantic Relation Reasoning (ESTER) dataset show significant improvements in both generative and extractive settings compared to the existing strong baselines, achieving over 8.4% gain in the token-level F1 score and 3.0% gain in Exact Match (EM) score under the multi-answer setting. Qualitative analysis reveals the high quality of the generated answers by TranCLR, demonstrating the feasibility of injecting event knowledge into QA model learning.

> Text summarization is a user-preference based task, i.e., for one document, users often have different priorities for summary. As a key aspect of customization in summarization, granularity is used to measure the semantic coverage between the summary and source document. However, developing systems that can generate summaries with customizable semantic coverage is still an under-explored topic. In this paper, we propose the first unsupervised multi-granularity summarization framework, GranuSum. We take events as the basic semantic units of the source documents and propose to rank these events by their salience. We also develop a model to summarize input documents with given events as anchors and hints. By inputting different numbers of events, GranuSum is capable of producing multi-granular summaries in an unsupervised manner. Meanwhile, we annotate a new benchmark GranuDUC that contains multiple summaries at different granularities for each document cluster. Experimental results confirm the substantial superiority of GranuSum on multi-granularity summarization over strong baselines. Further, by exploiting the event information, GranuSum also exhibits state-of-the-art performance under the conventional unsupervised abstractive setting.

Our model also enables us to estimate the distribution over continuous trajectories conditioned on a scenario, representing what each discrete action would look like if executed in that scenario. While our primary objective is to learn representative action sets, these capabilities combine to produce accurate multimodal trajectory predictions as a byproduct. Although our learned action representations closely resemble semantically meaningful categories (e.g., "go straight", "turn left", etc.), our method is entirely self-supervised and does not utilize any manually generated labels or categories. Our method builds upon recent advances in variational inference and deep unsupervised clustering, resulting in full distribution estimates based on deterministic model evaluations.

> This paper proposes an effective computational tool for brittle crack propagation problems based on a combination of a higher-order phase-field model and a non-conforming mesh using a NURBS-based isogeometric approach. This combination, as demonstrated in this paper, is of great benefit in reducing the computational cost of using a local refinement mesh and a higher-order phase-field, which needs higher derivatives of basis functions. Compared with other approaches using a local refinement mesh, the Virtual Uncommon-Knot-Inserted Master-Slave (VUKIMS) method presented here is not only simple to implement but can also reduce the variable numbers. VUKIMS is an outstanding choice in order to establish a local refinement mesh, i.e. a non-conforming mesh, in a multi-patch problem. A phase-field model is an efficient approach for various complicated crack patterns, including those with or without an initial crack path, curved cracks, crack coalescence, and crack propagation through holes. The paper demonstrates that cubic NURBS elements are ideal for balancing the computational cost and the accuracy because they can produce accurate solutions by utilising a lower degree of freedom number than an extremely fine mesh of first-order B-spline elements.

> Modal verbs (e.g., "can", "should", or "must") occur highly frequently in scientific articles. Decoding their function is not straightforward: they are often used for hedging, but they may also denote abilities and restrictions. Understanding their meaning is important for various NLP tasks such as writing assistance or accurate information extraction from scientific text.   To foster research on the usage of modals in this genre, we introduce the MIST (Modals In Scientific Text) dataset, which contains 3737 modal instances in five scientific domains annotated for their semantic, pragmatic, or rhetorical function. We systematically evaluate a set of competitive neural architectures on MIST. Transfer experiments reveal that leveraging non-scientific data is of limited benefit for modeling the distinctions in MIST. Our corpus analysis provides evidence that scientific communities differ in their usage of modal verbs, yet, classifiers trained on scientific data generalize to some extent to unseen scientific domains.

> We propose an approach for semantic imitation, which uses demonstrations from a source domain, e.g. human videos, to accelerate reinforcement learning (RL) in a different target domain, e.g. a robotic manipulator in a simulated kitchen. Instead of imitating low-level actions like joint velocities, our approach imitates the sequence of demonstrated semantic skills like "opening the microwave" or "turning on the stove". This allows us to transfer demonstrations across environments (e.g. real-world to simulated kitchen) and agent embodiments (e.g. bimanual human demonstration to robotic arm). We evaluate on three challenging cross-domain learning problems and match the performance of demonstration-accelerated RL approaches that require in-domain demonstrations. In a simulated kitchen environment, our approach learns long-horizon robot manipulation tasks, using less than 3 minutes of human video demonstrations from a real-world kitchen. This enables scaling robot learning via the reuse of demonstrations, e.g. collected as human videos, for learning in any number of target domains.

> Random forests are some of the most widely used machine learning models today, especially in domains that necessitate interpretability. We present an algorithm that accelerates the training of random forests and other popular tree-based learning methods. At the core of our algorithm is a novel node-splitting subroutine, dubbed MABSplit, used to efficiently find split points when constructing decision trees. Our algorithm borrows techniques from the multi-armed bandit literature to judiciously determine how to allocate samples and computational power across candidate split points. We provide theoretical guarantees that MABSplit improves the sample complexity of each node split from linear to logarithmic in the number of data points. In some settings, MABSplit leads to 100x faster training (an 99% reduction in training time) without any decrease in generalization performance. We demonstrate similar speedups when MABSplit is used across a variety of forest-based variants, such as Extremely Random Forests and Random Patches. We also show our algorithm can be used in both classification and regression tasks. Finally, we show that MABSplit outperforms existing methods in generalization performance and feature importance calculations under a fixed computational budget. All of our experimental results are reproducible via a one-line script at https://github.com/ThrunGroup/FastForest.

> This study introduces and examines the potential of an AI system to generate health awareness messages. The topic of folic acid, a vitamin that is critical during pregnancy, served as a test case. Using prompt engineering, we generated messages that could be used to raise awareness and compared them to retweeted human-generated messages via computational and human evaluation methods. The system was easy to use and prolific, and computational analyses revealed that the AI-generated messages were on par with human-generated ones in terms of sentiment, reading ease, and semantic content. Also, the human evaluation study showed that AI-generated messages ranked higher in message quality and clarity. We discuss the theoretical, practical, and ethical implications of these results.

> In this paper we propose a general approach to define a many-valued preferential interpretation of gradual argumentation semantics. The approach allows for conditional reasoning over arguments and boolean combination of arguments, with respect to a class of gradual semantics, through the verification of graded (strict or defeasible) implications over a preferential interpretation. As a proof of concept, in the finitely-valued case, an Answer set Programming approach is proposed for conditional reasoning in a many-valued argumentation semantics of weighted argumentation graphs. The paper also develops and discusses a probabilistic semantics for gradual argumentation, which builds on the many-valued conditional semantics.

> We propose a fully unsupervised method to detect bias in contextualized embeddings. The method leverages the assortative information latently encoded by social networks and combines orthogonality regularization, structured sparsity learning, and graph neural networks to find the embedding subspace capturing this information. As a concrete example, we focus on the phenomenon of ideological bias: we introduce the concept of an ideological subspace, show how it can be found by applying our method to online discussion forums, and present techniques to probe it. Our experiments suggest that the ideological subspace encodes abstract evaluative semantics and reflects changes in the political left-right spectrum during the presidency of Donald Trump.

> This paper presents the first attempt to learn semantic boundary detection using image-level class labels as supervision. Our method starts by estimating coarse areas of object classes through attentions drawn by an image classification network. Since boundaries will locate somewhere between such areas of different classes, our task is formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where pixels on a line segment connecting areas of two different classes are regarded as a bag of boundary candidates. Moreover, we design a new neural network architecture that can learn to estimate semantic boundaries reliably even with uncertain supervision given by the MIL strategy. Our network is used to generate pseudo semantic boundary labels of training images, which are in turn used to train fully supervised models. The final model trained with our pseudo labels achieves an outstanding performance on the SBD dataset, where it is as competitive as some of previous arts trained with stronger supervision.

> Lifelong learners must recognize concept vocabularies that evolve over time. A common yet underexplored scenario is learning with class labels that continually refine/expand old classes. For example, humans learn to recognize ${\tt dog}$ before dog breeds. In practical settings, dataset $\textit{versioning}$ often introduces refinement to ontologies, such as autonomous vehicle benchmarks that refine a previous ${\tt vehicle}$ class into ${\tt school-bus}$ as autonomous operations expand to new cities. This paper formalizes a protocol for studying the problem of $\textit{Learning with Evolving Class Ontology}$ (LECO). LECO requires learning classifiers in distinct time periods (TPs); each TP introduces a new ontology of "fine" labels that refines old ontologies of "coarse" labels (e.g., dog breeds that refine the previous ${\tt dog}$). LECO explores such questions as whether to annotate new data or relabel the old, how to leverage coarse labels, and whether to finetune the previous TP's model or train from scratch. To answer these questions, we leverage insights from related problems such as class-incremental learning. We validate them under the LECO protocol through the lens of image classification (CIFAR and iNaturalist) and semantic segmentation (Mapillary). Our experiments lead to surprising conclusions; while the current status quo is to relabel existing datasets with new ontologies (such as COCO-to-LVIS or Mapillary1.2-to-2.0), LECO demonstrates that a far better strategy is to annotate $\textit{new}$ data with the new ontology. However, this produces an aggregate dataset with inconsistent old-vs-new labels, complicating learning. To address this challenge, we adopt methods from semi-supervised and partial-label learning. Such strategies can surprisingly be made near-optimal, approaching an "oracle" that learns on the aggregate dataset exhaustively labeled with the newest ontology.

> Real-time video segmentation is a crucial task for many real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robot control. Since state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models are often too heavy for real-time applications despite their impressive performance, researchers have proposed lightweight architectures with speed-accuracy trade-offs, achieving real-time speed at the expense of reduced accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to speed up any architecture with skip-connections for real-time vision tasks by exploiting the temporal locality in videos. Specifically, at the arrival of each frame, we transform the features from the previous frame to reuse them at specific spatial bins. We then perform partial computation of the backbone network on the regions of the current frame that captures temporal differences between the current and previous frame. This is done by dynamically dropping out residual blocks using a gating mechanism which decides which blocks to drop based on inter-frame distortion. We validate our Spatial-Temporal Mask Generator (STMG) on video semantic segmentation benchmarks with multiple backbone networks, and show that our method largely speeds up inference with minimal loss of accuracy.

> Ports are striving for innovative technological solutions to cope with the increasing growth in demand of goods transport, while at the same time improving their environmental footprint. An emerging technology that has the potential to substantially increase the effectiveness of the multifaceted and interconnected port processes is that of digital twins. Innovation-leading ports recognizing the potential of twinning have already started working on it. However, since there is no clear consensus on what a digital twin of a complex system comprises and how it should be designed, deployed digital twin solutions for ports often differ significantly. This article addresses this issue by initially identifying three core aspect underpinning digital twins of complex systems, such as ports, and outlining five successive maturity levels based on these aspects' instantiation. These identified aspects and the derived maturity levels are then used to examine real-world cases by critically evaluating existing digital twinning solutions in the port of Singapore, the Mawan port of Shanghai, and that of Rotterdam. These being three of the world's innovation-leading ports, we naturally find in them most of the identified core aspects to be in line with their twinning implementation, which has reached, in all three, a higher level of maturity. Although, our work on maturity levels and core aspects can provide a guideline for designing and benchmarking future digital twinning solutions for ports, the capacity for innovation via twinning, even in the port domain, is highly contextual with key paragon being the availability of financial and technical resources.

> StyleGAN has achieved great progress in 2D face reconstruction and semantic editing via image inversion and latent editing. While studies over extending 2D StyleGAN to 3D faces have emerged, a corresponding generic 3D GAN inversion framework is still missing, limiting the applications of 3D face reconstruction and semantic editing. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of 3D GAN inversion where a latent code is predicted given a single face image to faithfully recover its 3D shapes and detailed textures. The problem is ill-posed: innumerable compositions of shape and texture could be rendered to the current image. Furthermore, with the limited capacity of a global latent code, 2D inversion methods cannot preserve faithful shape and texture at the same time when applied to 3D models. To solve this problem, we devise an effective self-training scheme to constrain the learning of inversion. The learning is done efficiently without any real-world 2D-3D training pairs but proxy samples generated from a 3D GAN. In addition, apart from a global latent code that captures the coarse shape and texture information, we augment the generation network with a local branch, where pixel-aligned features are added to faithfully reconstruct face details. We further consider a new pipeline to perform 3D view-consistent editing. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art inversion methods in both shape and texture reconstruction quality. Code and data will be released.

> Word embeddings are extensively used in various NLP problems as a state-of-the-art semantic feature vector representation. Despite their success on various tasks and domains, they might exhibit an undesired bias for stereotypical categories due to statistical and societal biases that exist in the dataset they are trained on. In this study, we analyze the gender bias in four different pre-trained word embeddings specifically for the depression category in the mental disorder domain. We use contextual and non-contextual embeddings that are trained on domain-independent as well as clinical domain-specific data. We observe that embeddings carry bias for depression towards different gender groups depending on the type of embeddings. Moreover, we demonstrate that these undesired correlations are transferred to the downstream task for depression phenotype recognition. We find that data augmentation by simply swapping gender words mitigates the bias significantly in the downstream task.

> A very recent trend in generative modeling is building 3D-aware generators from 2D image collections. To induce the 3D bias, such models typically rely on volumetric rendering, which is expensive to employ at high resolutions. During the past months, there appeared more than 10 works that address this scaling issue by training a separate 2D decoder to upsample a low-resolution image (or a feature tensor) produced from a pure 3D generator. But this solution comes at a cost: not only does it break multi-view consistency (i.e. shape and texture change when the camera moves), but it also learns the geometry in a low fidelity. In this work, we show that it is possible to obtain a high-resolution 3D generator with SotA image quality by following a completely different route of simply training the model patch-wise. We revisit and improve this optimization scheme in two ways. First, we design a location- and scale-aware discriminator to work on patches of different proportions and spatial positions. Second, we modify the patch sampling strategy based on an annealed beta distribution to stabilize training and accelerate the convergence. The resulted model, named EpiGRAF, is an efficient, high-resolution, pure 3D generator, and we test it on four datasets (two introduced in this work) at $256^2$ and $512^2$ resolutions. It obtains state-of-the-art image quality, high-fidelity geometry and trains ${\approx} 2.5 \times$ faster than the upsampler-based counterparts.

> With the advent of deep learning, a huge number of text-to-speech (TTS) models which produce human-like speech have emerged. Recently, by introducing syntactic and semantic information w.r.t the input text, various approaches have been proposed to enrich the naturalness and expressiveness of TTS models. Although these strategies showed impressive results, they still have some limitations in utilizing language information. First, most approaches only use graph networks to utilize syntactic and semantic information without considering linguistic features. Second, most previous works do not explicitly consider adjacent words when encoding syntactic and semantic information, even though it is obvious that adjacent words are usually meaningful when encoding the current word. To address these issues, we propose Relation-aware Word Encoding Network (RWEN), which effectively allows syntactic and semantic information based on two modules (i.e., Semantic-level Relation Encoding and Adjacent Word Relation Encoding). Experimental results show substantial improvements compared to previous works.

- `2201.10737v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10737v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10737v5)

> Transformers have made remarkable progress towards modeling long-range dependencies within the medical image analysis domain. However, current transformer-based models suffer from several disadvantages: (1) existing methods fail to capture the important features of the images due to the naive tokenization scheme; (2) the models suffer from information loss because they only consider single-scale feature representations; and (3) the segmentation label maps generated by the models are not accurate enough without considering rich semantic contexts and anatomical textures. In this work, we present CASTformer, a novel type of adversarial transformers, for 2D medical image segmentation. First, we take advantage of the pyramid structure to construct multi-scale representations and handle multi-scale variations. We then design a novel class-aware transformer module to better learn the discriminative regions of objects with semantic structures. Lastly, we utilize an adversarial training strategy that boosts segmentation accuracy and correspondingly allows a transformer-based discriminator to capture high-level semantically correlated contents and low-level anatomical features. Our experiments demonstrate that CASTformer dramatically outperforms previous state-of-the-art transformer-based approaches on three benchmarks, obtaining 2.54%-5.88% absolute improvements in Dice over previous models. Further qualitative experiments provide a more detailed picture of the model's inner workings, shed light on the challenges in improved transparency, and demonstrate that transfer learning can greatly improve performance and reduce the size of medical image datasets in training, making CASTformer a strong starting point for downstream medical image analysis tasks.

> We present a framework for video modeling based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models that produces long-duration video completions in a variety of realistic environments. We introduce a generative model that can at test-time sample any arbitrary subset of video frames conditioned on any other subset and present an architecture adapted for this purpose. Doing so allows us to efficiently compare and optimize a variety of schedules for the order in which frames in a long video are sampled and use selective sparse and long-range conditioning on previously sampled frames. We demonstrate improved video modeling over prior work on a number of datasets and sample temporally coherent videos over 25 minutes in length. We additionally release a new video modeling dataset and semantically meaningful metrics based on videos generated in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator.

- `2211.16822v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16822v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.16822v2)

> Commonsense knowledge-graphs (CKGs) are important resources towards building machines that can 'reason' on text or environmental inputs and make inferences beyond perception. While current CKGs encode world knowledge for a large number of concepts and have been effectively utilized for incorporating commonsense in neural models, they primarily encode declarative or single-condition inferential knowledge and assume all conceptual beliefs to have the same likelihood. Further, these CKGs utilize a limited set of relations shared across concepts and lack a coherent knowledge organization structure resulting in redundancies as well as sparsity across the larger knowledge graph. Consequently, today's CKGs, while useful for a first level of reasoning, do not adequately capture deeper human-level commonsense inferences which can be more nuanced and influenced by multiple contextual or situational factors.   Accordingly, in this work, we study how commonsense knowledge can be better represented by -- (i) utilizing a probabilistic logic representation scheme to model composite inferential knowledge and represent conceptual beliefs with varying likelihoods and (ii) incorporating a hierarchical conceptual ontology to identify salient concept-relevant relations and organize beliefs at different conceptual levels. Our resulting knowledge representation framework can encode a wider variety of world knowledge and represent beliefs flexibly using grounded concepts as well as free-text phrases. As a result, the framework can be utilized as both a traditional free-text knowledge graph and a grounded logic-based inference system more suitable for neuro-symbolic applications. We describe how we extend the PrimeNet knowledge base with our framework through crowd-sourcing and expert-annotation, and demonstrate its application for more interpretable passage-based semantic parsing and question answering.

> Humans are skilled in reading the interlocutor's emotion from multimodal signals, including spoken words, simultaneous speech, and facial expressions. It is still a challenge to effectively decode emotions from the complex interactions of multimodal signals. In this paper, we design three kinds of multimodal latent representations to refine the emotion analysis process and capture complex multimodal interactions from different views, including a intact three-modal integrating representation, a modality-shared representation, and three modality-individual representations. Then, a modality-semantic hierarchical fusion is proposed to reasonably incorporate these representations into a comprehensive interaction representation. The experimental results demonstrate that our EffMulti outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The compelling performance benefits from its well-designed framework with ease of implementation, lower computing complexity, and less trainable parameters.

> Script is a kind of structured knowledge extracted from texts, which contains a sequence of events. Based on such knowledge, script event prediction aims to predict the subsequent event. To do so, two aspects should be considered for events, namely, event description (i.e., what the events should contain) and event encoding (i.e., how they should be encoded). Most existing methods describe an event by a verb together with only a few core arguments (i.e., subject, object, and indirect object), which are not precise. In addition, existing event encoders are limited to a fixed number of arguments, which are not flexible to deal with extra information. Thus, in this paper, we propose the Rich Event Prediction (REP) framework for script event prediction. Fundamentally, it is based on the proposed rich event description, which enriches the existing ones with three kinds of important information, namely, the senses of verbs, extra semantic roles, and types of participants. REP contains an event extractor to extract such information from texts. Based on the extracted rich information, a predictor then selects the most probable subsequent event. The core component of the predictor is a transformer-based event encoder to flexibly deal with an arbitrary number of arguments. Experimental results on the widely used Gigaword Corpus show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

> Adversarial patch attacks create adversarial examples by injecting arbitrary distortions within a bounded region of the input to fool deep neural networks (DNNs). These attacks are robust (i.e., physically-realizable) and universally malicious, and hence represent a severe security threat to real-world DNN-based systems.   We propose Jujutsu, a two-stage technique to detect and mitigate robust and universal adversarial patch attacks. We first observe that adversarial patches are crafted as localized features that yield large influence on the prediction output, and continue to dominate the prediction on any input. Jujutsu leverages this observation for accurate attack detection with low false positives. Patch attacks corrupt only a localized region of the input, while the majority of the input remains unperturbed. Therefore, Jujutsu leverages generative adversarial networks (GAN) to perform localized attack recovery by synthesizing the semantic contents of the input that are corrupted by the attacks, and reconstructs a ``clean'' input for correct prediction.   We evaluate Jujutsu on four diverse datasets spanning 8 different DNN models, and find that it achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms four existing defenses. We further evaluate Jujutsu against physical-world attacks, as well as adaptive attacks.

> Background samples provide key contextual information for segmenting regions of interest (ROIs). However, they always cover a diverse set of structures, causing difficulties for the segmentation model to learn good decision boundaries with high sensitivity and precision. The issue concerns the highly heterogeneous nature of the background class, resulting in multi-modal distributions. Empirically, we find that neural networks trained with heterogeneous background struggle to map the corresponding contextual samples to compact clusters in feature space. As a result, the distribution over background logit activations may shift across the decision boundary, leading to systematic over-segmentation across different datasets and tasks. In this study, we propose context label learning (CoLab) to improve the context representations by decomposing the background class into several subclasses. Specifically, we train an auxiliary network as a task generator, along with the primary segmentation model, to automatically generate context labels that positively affect the ROI segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging segmentation tasks and datasets. The results demonstrate that CoLab can guide the segmentation model to map the logits of background samples away from the decision boundary, resulting in significantly improved segmentation accuracy. Code is available.

> An important component of an automated fact-checking system is the claim check-worthiness detection system, which ranks sentences by prioritising them based on their need to be checked. Despite a body of research tackling the task, previous research has overlooked the challenging nature of identifying check-worthy claims across different topics. In this paper, we assess and quantify the challenge of detecting check-worthy claims for new, unseen topics. After highlighting the problem, we propose the AraCWA model to mitigate the performance deterioration when detecting check-worthy claims across topics. The AraCWA model enables boosting the performance for new topics by incorporating two components for few-shot learning and data augmentation. Using a publicly available dataset of Arabic tweets consisting of 14 different topics, we demonstrate that our proposed data augmentation strategy achieves substantial improvements across topics overall, where the extent of the improvement varies across topics. Further, we analyse the semantic similarities between topics, suggesting that the similarity metric could be used as a proxy to determine the difficulty level of an unseen topic prior to undertaking the task of labelling the underlying sentences.

> Prompting large language models has enabled significant recent progress in multi-step reasoning over text. However, when applied to text generation from semi-structured data (e.g., graphs or tables), these methods typically suffer from low semantic coverage, hallucination, and logical inconsistency. We propose MURMUR, a neuro-symbolic modular approach to text generation from semi-structured data with multi-step reasoning. MURMUR is a best-first search method that generates reasoning paths using: (1) neural and symbolic modules with specific linguistic and logical skills, (2) a grammar whose production rules define valid compositions of modules, and (3) value functions that assess the quality of each reasoning step. We conduct experiments on two diverse data-to-text generation tasks like WebNLG and LogicNLG. These tasks differ in their data representations (graphs and tables) and span multiple linguistic and logical skills. MURMUR obtains significant improvements over recent few-shot baselines like direct prompting and chain-of-thought prompting, while also achieving comparable performance to fine-tuned GPT-2 on out-of-domain data. Moreover, human evaluation shows that MURMUR generates highly faithful and correct reasoning paths that lead to 26% more logically consistent summaries on LogicNLG, compared to direct prompting.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been the subject of active research, significantly advancing the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). From BERT to BLOOM, LLMs have surpassed state-of-the-art results in various natural language tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text generation. Many ongoing efforts focus on understanding LLMs' capabilities, including their knowledge of the world, syntax, and semantics. However, extending the textual prowess of LLMs to symbolic reasoning has been slow and predominantly focused on tackling problems related to the mathematical field. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automated planning - a branch of AI concerned with the realization of action sequences (plans) to achieve a goal, typically executed by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and unmanned vehicles. We introduce Plansformer; an LLM fine-tuned on planning problems and capable of generating plans with favorable behavior in terms of correctness and length with reduced knowledge-engineering efforts. We also demonstrate the adaptability of Plansformer in solving different planning domains with varying complexities, owing to the transfer learning abilities of LLMs. For one configuration of Plansformer, we achieve ~97% valid plans, out of which ~95% are optimal for Towers of Hanoi - a puzzle-solving domain.

> There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to process and interpret electronic health records (EHRs). Natural language processing (NLP) powered by pretrained language models is the key technology for medical AI systems utilizing clinical narratives. However, there are few clinical language models, the largest of which trained in the clinical domain is comparatively small at 110 million parameters (compared with billions of parameters in the general domain). It is not clear how large clinical language models with billions of parameters can help medical AI systems utilize unstructured EHRs. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical language model - GatorTron - using >90 billion words of text (including >82 billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on 5 clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and medical question answering (MQA). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these NLP tasks. GatorTron models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve 5 clinical NLP tasks (e.g., 9.6% and 9.5% improvement in accuracy for NLI and MQA), which can be applied to medical AI systems to improve healthcare delivery.

> Recently, there has been increasing interest in synthesizing data to improve downstream text-to-SQL tasks. In this paper, we first examined the existing synthesized datasets and discovered that state-of-the-art text-to-SQL algorithms did not further improve on popular benchmarks when trained with augmented synthetic data. We observed two shortcomings: illogical synthetic SQL queries from independent column sampling and arbitrary table joins. To address these issues, we propose a novel synthesis framework that incorporates key relationships from schema, imposes strong typing, and conducts schema-distance-weighted column sampling. We also adopt an intermediate representation (IR) for the SQL-to-text task to further improve the quality of the generated natural language questions. When existing powerful semantic parsers are pre-finetuned on our high-quality synthesized data, our experiments show that these models have significant accuracy boosts on popular benchmarks, including new state-of-the-art performance on Spider.

> In the last decade, several studies have explored automated techniques to estimate the effort of agile software development. We perform a close replication and extension of a seminal work proposing the use of Deep Learning for Agile Effort Estimation (namely Deep-SE), which has set the state-of-the-art since. Specifically, we replicate three of the original research questions aiming at investigating the effectiveness of Deep-SE for both within-project and cross-project effort estimation. We benchmark Deep-SE against three baselines (i.e., Random, Mean and Median effort estimators) and a previously proposed method to estimate agile software project development effort (dubbed TF/IDF-SVM), as done in the original study. To this end, we use the data from the original study and an additional dataset of 31,960 issues mined from TAWOS, as using more data allows us to strengthen the confidence in the results, and to further mitigate external validity threats. The results of our replication show that Deep-SE outperforms the Median baseline estimator and TF/IDF-SVM in only very few cases with statistical significance (8/42 and 9/32 cases, respectively), thus confounding previous findings on the efficacy of Deep-SE. The two additional RQs revealed that neither augmenting the training set nor pre-training Deep-SE play lead to an improvement of its accuracy and convergence speed. These results suggest that using semantic similarity is not enough to differentiate user stories with respect to their story points; thus, future work has yet to explore and find new techniques and features that obtain accurate agile software development estimates.

> End-to-end (E2E) task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are prone to fall into the so-called "likelihood trap", resulting in generated responses which are dull, repetitive, and often inconsistent with dialogue history. Comparing ranked lists of multiple generated responses against the "gold response" (from evaluation data) reveals a wide diversity in response quality, with many good responses placed lower in the ranked list. The main challenge, addressed in this work, is then how to reach beyond greedily generated system responses, that is, how to obtain and select such high-quality responses from the list of overgenerated responses at inference without availability of the gold response. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method which aims to select high-quality items from the lists of responses initially overgenerated by the system. The idea is to use any sequence-level (similarity) scoring function to divide the semantic space of responses into high-scoring versus low-scoring partitions. At training, the high-scoring partition comprises all generated responses whose similarity to the gold response is higher than the similarity of the greedy response to the gold response. At inference, the aim is to estimate the probability that each overgenerated response belongs to the high-scoring partition, given only previous dialogue history. We validate the robustness and versatility of our proposed method on the standard MultiWOZ dataset: our methods improve a state-of-the-art E2E ToD system by 2.0 BLEU, 1.6 ROUGE, and 1.3 METEOR scores, achieving new peak results. Additional experiments on the BiTOD dataset and human evaluation further ascertain the generalisability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

> Most recent semantic frame parsing systems for spoken language understanding (SLU) are designed based on recurrent neural networks. These systems display decent performance on benchmark SLU datasets such as ATIS or SNIPS, which contain short utterances with relatively simple patterns. However, the current semantic frame parsing models lack a mechanism to handle out-of-distribution (\emph{OOD}) patterns and out-of-vocabulary (\emph{OOV}) tokens. In this paper, we introduce a robust semantic frame parsing pipeline that can handle both \emph{OOD} patterns and \emph{OOV} tokens in conjunction with a new complex Twitter dataset that contains long tweets with more \emph{OOD} patterns and \emph{OOV} tokens. The new pipeline demonstrates much better results in comparison to state-of-the-art baseline SLU models on both the SNIPS dataset and the new Twitter dataset (Our new Twitter dataset can be downloaded from https://1drv.ms/u/s!AroHb-W6_OAlavK4begsDsMALfE?e=c8f2XX ). Finally, we also build an E2E application to demo the feasibility of our algorithm and show why it is useful in real application.

> Video captioning aims to generate natural language sentences that describe the given video accurately. Existing methods obtain favorable generation by exploring richer visual representations in encode phase or improving the decoding ability. However, the long-tailed problem hinders these attempts at low-frequency tokens, which rarely occur but carry critical semantics, playing a vital role in the detailed generation. In this paper, we introduce a novel Refined Semantic enhancement method towards Frequency Diffusion (RSFD), a captioning model that constantly perceives the linguistic representation of the infrequent tokens. Concretely, a Frequency-Aware Diffusion (FAD) module is proposed to comprehend the semantics of low-frequency tokens to break through generation limitations. In this way, the caption is refined by promoting the absorption of tokens with insufficient occurrence. Based on FAD, we design a Divergent Semantic Supervisor (DSS) module to compensate for the information loss of high-frequency tokens brought by the diffusion process, where the semantics of low-frequency tokens is further emphasized to alleviate the long-tailed problem. Extensive experiments indicate that RSFD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate that the enhancement of low-frequency tokens semantics can obtain a competitive generation effect. Code is available at https://github.com/lzp870/RSFD.

> The emergence of neural networks has revolutionized the field of motion synthesis. Yet, learning to unconditionally synthesize motions from a given distribution remains challenging, especially when the motions are highly diverse. In this work, we present MoDi -- a generative model trained in an unsupervised setting from an extremely diverse, unstructured and unlabeled dataset. During inference, MoDi can synthesize high-quality, diverse motions. Despite the lack of any structure in the dataset, our model yields a well-behaved and highly structured latent space, which can be semantically clustered, constituting a strong motion prior that facilitates various applications including semantic editing and crowd simulation. In addition, we present an encoder that inverts real motions into MoDi's natural motion manifold, issuing solutions to various ill-posed challenges such as completion from prefix and spatial editing. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments achieve state-of-the-art results that outperform recent SOTA techniques. Code and trained models are available at https://sigal-raab.github.io/MoDi.

> The massive growth of self-supervised learning (SSL) has been witnessed in language, vision, speech, and audio domains over the past few years. While discrete label prediction is widely adopted for other modalities, the state-of-the-art audio SSL models still employ reconstruction loss for pre-training. Compared with reconstruction loss, semantic-rich discrete label prediction encourages the SSL model to abstract the high-level audio semantics and discard the redundant details as in human perception. However, a semantic-rich acoustic tokenizer for general audio pre-training is usually not straightforward to obtain, due to the continuous property of audio and unavailable phoneme sequences like speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose BEATs, an iterative audio pre-training framework to learn Bidirectional Encoder representation from Audio Transformers, where an acoustic tokenizer and an audio SSL model are optimized by iterations. In the first iteration, we use random projection as the acoustic tokenizer to train an audio SSL model in a mask and label prediction manner. Then, we train an acoustic tokenizer for the next iteration by distilling the semantic knowledge from the pre-trained or fine-tuned audio SSL model. The iteration is repeated with the hope of mutual promotion of the acoustic tokenizer and audio SSL model. The experimental results demonstrate our acoustic tokenizers can generate discrete labels with rich audio semantics and our audio SSL models achieve state-of-the-art results across various audio classification benchmarks, even outperforming previous models that use more training data and model parameters significantly. Specifically, we set a new state-of-the-art mAP 50.6% on AudioSet-2M for audio-only models without using any external data, and 98.1% accuracy on ESC-50. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://aka.ms/beats.

> Achieving artificially intelligent-native wireless networks is necessary for the operation of future 6G applications such as the metaverse. Nonetheless, current communication schemes are, at heart, a mere reconstruction process that lacks reasoning. One key solution that enables evolving wireless communication to a human-like conversation is semantic communications. In this paper, a novel machine reasoning framework is proposed to pre-process and disentangle source data so as to make it semantic-ready. In particular, a novel contrastive learning framework is proposed, whereby instance and cluster discrimination are performed on the data. These two tasks enable increasing the cohesiveness between data points mapping to semantically similar content elements and disentangling data points of semantically different content elements. Subsequently, the semantic deep clusters formed are ranked according to their level of confidence. Deep semantic clusters of highest confidence are considered learnable, semantic-rich data, i.e., data that can be used to build a language in a semantic communications system. The least confident ones are considered, random, semantic-poor, and memorizable data that must be transmitted classically. Our simulation results showcase the superiority of our contrastive learning approach in terms of semantic impact and minimalism. In fact, the length of the semantic representation achieved is minimized by 57.22% compared to vanilla semantic communication systems, thus achieving minimalist semantic representations.

> Self-supervised representation learning (SSL) on biomedical networks provides new opportunities for drug discovery. However, how to effectively combine multiple SSL models is still challenging and has been rarely explored. Therefore, we propose multi-task joint strategies of self-supervised representation learning on biomedical networks for drug discovery, named MSSL2drug. We design six basic SSL tasks inspired by various modality features including structures, semantics, and attributes in heterogeneous biomedical networks. Importantly, fifteen combinations of multiple tasks are evaluated by a graph attention-based multi-task adversarial learning framework in two drug discovery scenarios. The results suggest two important findings. (1) Combinations of multimodal tasks achieve the best performance compared to other multi-task joint models. (2) The local-global combination models yield higher performance than random two-task combinations when there are the same size of modalities. Therefore, we conjecture that the multimodal and local-global combination strategies can be treated as the guideline of multi-task SSL for drug discovery.

> A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to learn new concepts purely from language. Several recent approaches have explored training machine learning models via natural language supervision. However, these approaches fall short in leveraging linguistic quantifiers (such as 'always' or 'rarely') and mimicking humans in compositionally learning complex tasks. Here, we present LaSQuE, a method that can learn zero-shot classifiers from language explanations by using three new strategies - (1) modeling the semantics of linguistic quantifiers in explanations (including exploiting ordinal strength relationships, such as 'always' > 'likely'), (2) aggregating information from multiple explanations using an attention-based mechanism, and (3) model training via curriculum learning. With these strategies, LaSQuE outperforms prior work, showing an absolute gain of up to 7% in generalizing to unseen real-world classification tasks.

> Natural Language Understanding has seen an increasing number of publications in the last few years, especially after robust word embeddings models became prominent, when they proved themselves able to capture and represent semantic relationships from massive amounts of data. Nevertheless, traditional models often fall short in intrinsic issues of linguistics, such as polysemy and homonymy. Any expert system that makes use of natural language in its core, can be affected by a weak semantic representation of text, resulting in inaccurate outcomes based on poor decisions. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel approach called Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA), that disambiguates and annotates each word by its specific sense, considering the semantic effects of its context. Our approach brings three main contributions to the semantic representation scenario: (i) an unsupervised technique that disambiguates and annotates words by their senses, (ii) a multi-sense embeddings model that can be extended to any traditional word embeddings algorithm, and (iii) a recurrent methodology that allows our models to be re-used and their representations refined. We test our approach on six different benchmarks for the word similarity task, showing that our approach can produce state-of-the-art results and outperforms several more complex state-of-the-art systems.

> The relationship between words in a sentence often tells us more about the underlying semantic content of a document than its actual words, individually. In this work, we propose two novel algorithms, called Flexible Lexical Chain II and Fixed Lexical Chain II. These algorithms combine the semantic relations derived from lexical chains, prior knowledge from lexical databases, and the robustness of the distributional hypothesis in word embeddings as building blocks forming a single system. In short, our approach has three main contributions: (i) a set of techniques that fully integrate word embeddings and lexical chains; (ii) a more robust semantic representation that considers the latent relation between words in a document; and (iii) lightweight word embeddings models that can be extended to any natural language task. We intend to assess the knowledge of pre-trained models to evaluate their robustness in the document classification task. The proposed techniques are tested against seven word embeddings algorithms using five different machine learning classifiers over six scenarios in the document classification task. Our results show the integration between lexical chains and word embeddings representations sustain state-of-the-art results, even against more complex systems.

> Large language models have demonstrated the ability to generate both natural language and programming language text. Such models open up the possibility of multi-language code generation: could code generation models generalize knowledge from one language to another? Although contemporary code generation models can generate semantically correct Python code, little is known about their abilities with other languages. We propose MultiPL-E, a system for translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages. We create the first massively multilingual code generation benchmark by using MultiPL-E to translate two popular Python code generation benchmarks to 18 additional programming languages.   We use MultiPL-E to extend the HumanEval benchmark and MBPP benchmark to 18 languages that encompass a range of programming paradigms and popularity. Using these new parallel benchmarks, we evaluate the multi-language performance of three state-of-the-art code generation models: Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder. We find that Codex matches or even exceeds its performance on Python for several other languages. The range of programming languages represented in MultiPL-E allow us to explore the impact of language frequency and language features on model performance. Finally, the MultiPL-E approach of compiling code generation benchmarks to new programming languages is both scalable and extensible, making it straightforward to evaluate new models, benchmarks, and languages.

> Segmentation of lidar data is a task that provides rich, point-wise information about the environment of robots or autonomous vehicles. Currently best performing neural networks for lidar segmentation are fine-tuned to specific datasets. Switching the lidar sensor without retraining on a big set of annotated data from the new sensor creates a domain shift, which causes the network performance to drop drastically. In this work we propose a new method for lidar domain adaption, in which we use annotated panoptic lidar datasets and recreate the recorded scenes in the structure of a different lidar sensor. We narrow the domain gap to the target data by recreating panoptic data from one domain in another and mixing the generated data with parts of (pseudo) labeled target domain data. Our method improves the nuScenes to SemanticKITTI unsupervised domain adaptation performance by 15.2 mean Intersection over Union points (mIoU) and by 48.3 mIoU in our semi-supervised approach. We demonstrate a similar improvement for the SemanticKITTI to nuScenes domain adaptation by 21.8 mIoU and 51.5 mIoU, respectively. We compare our method with two state of the art approaches for semantic lidar segmentation domain adaptation with a significant improvement for unsupervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation. Furthermore we successfully apply our proposed method to two entirely unlabeled datasets of two state of the art lidar sensors Velodyne Alpha Prime and InnovizTwo, and train well performing semantic segmentation networks for both.

> Automatic anatomical landmark localization has made great strides by leveraging deep learning methods in recent years. The ability to quantify the uncertainty of these predictions is a vital component needed for these methods to be adopted in clinical settings, where it is imperative that erroneous predictions are caught and corrected. We propose Quantile Binning, a data-driven method to categorize predictions by uncertainty with estimated error bounds. Our framework can be applied to any continuous uncertainty measure, allowing straightforward identification of the best subset of predictions with accompanying estimated error bounds. We facilitate easy comparison between uncertainty measures by constructing two evaluation metrics derived from Quantile Binning. We compare and contrast three epistemic uncertainty measures (two baselines, and a proposed method combining aspects of the two), derived from two heatmap-based landmark localization model paradigms (U-Net and patch-based). We show results across three datasets, including a publicly available Cephalometric dataset. We illustrate how filtering out gross mispredictions caught in our Quantile Bins significantly improves the proportion of predictions under an acceptable error threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that Quantile Binning remains effective on landmarks with high aleatoric uncertainty caused by inherent landmark ambiguity, and offer recommendations on which uncertainty measure to use and how to use it. The code and data are available at https://github.com/schobs/qbin.

> Unsupervised pre-training on millions of digital-born or scanned documents has shown promising advances in visual document understanding~(VDU). While various vision-language pre-training objectives are studied in existing solutions, the document textline, as an intrinsic granularity in VDU, has seldom been explored so far. A document textline usually contains words that are spatially and semantically correlated, which can be easily obtained from OCR engines. In this paper, we propose Wukong-Reader, trained with new pre-training objectives to leverage the structural knowledge nested in document textlines. We introduce textline-region contrastive learning to achieve fine-grained alignment between the visual regions and texts of document textlines. Furthermore, masked region modeling and textline-grid matching are also designed to enhance the visual and layout representations of textlines. Experiments show that our Wukong-Reader has superior performance on various VDU tasks such as information extraction. The fine-grained alignment over textlines also empowers Wukong-Reader with promising localization ability.

> In the past few decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available data produced from various sources with different topics. The availability of this enormous data necessitates us to adopt effective computational tools to explore the data. This leads to an intense growing interest in the research community to develop computational methods focused on processing this text data. A line of study focused on condensing the text so that we are able to get a higher level of understanding in a shorter time. The two important tasks to do this are keyword extraction and text summarization. In keyword extraction, we are interested in finding the key important words from a text. This makes us familiar with the general topic of a text. In text summarization, we are interested in producing a short-length text which includes important information about the document. The TextRank algorithm, an unsupervised learning method that is an extension of the PageRank (algorithm which is the base algorithm of Google search engine for searching pages and ranking them) has shown its efficacy in large-scale text mining, especially for text summarization and keyword extraction. this algorithm can automatically extract the important parts of a text (keywords or sentences) and declare them as the result. However, this algorithm neglects the semantic similarity between the different parts. In this work, we improved the results of the TextRank algorithm by incorporating the semantic similarity between parts of the text. Aside from keyword extraction and text summarization, we develop a topic clustering algorithm based on our framework which can be used individually or as a part of generating the summary to overcome coverage problems.

> This paper investigates the problem of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extreme low-resource languages with only a few hundred tagged data samples. NER is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). A critical driver accelerating NER systems' progress is the existence of large-scale language corpora that enable NER systems to achieve outstanding performance in languages such as English and French with abundant training data. However, NER for low-resource languages remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Mask Augmented Named Entity Recognition (MANER), a new methodology that leverages the distributional hypothesis of pre-trained masked language models (MLMs) for NER. The <mask> token in pre-trained MLMs encodes valuable semantic contextual information. MANER re-purposes the <mask> token for NER prediction. Specifically, we prepend the <mask> token to every word in a sentence for which we would like to predict the named entity tag. During training, we jointly fine-tune the MLM and a new NER prediction head attached to each <mask> token. We demonstrate that MANER is well-suited for NER in low-resource languages; our experiments show that for 100 languages with as few as 100 training examples, it improves on state-of-the-art methods by up to 48% and by 12% on average on F1 score. We also perform detailed analyses and ablation studies to understand the scenarios that are best-suited to MANER.

> Self-attention based transformer models have been dominating many computer vision tasks in the past few years. Their superb model qualities heavily depend on the excessively large labeled image datasets. In order to reduce the reliance on large labeled datasets, reconstruction based masked autoencoders are gaining popularity, which learn high quality transferable representations from unlabeled images. For the same purpose, recent weakly supervised image pretraining methods explore language supervision from text captions accompanying the images. In this work, we propose masked image pretraining on language assisted representation, dubbed as MILAN. Instead of predicting raw pixels or low level features, our pretraining objective is to reconstruct the image features with substantial semantic signals that are obtained using caption supervision. Moreover, to accommodate our reconstruction target, we propose a more effective prompting decoder architecture and a semantic aware mask sampling mechanism, which further advance the transfer performance of the pretrained model. Experimental results demonstrate that MILAN delivers higher accuracy than the previous works. When the masked autoencoder is pretrained and finetuned on ImageNet-1K dataset with an input resolution of 224x224, MILAN achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% on ViT-Base, surpassing previous state-of-the-arts by 1%. In the downstream semantic segmentation task, MILAN achieves 52.7 mIoU using ViT-Base on ADE20K dataset, outperforming previous masked pretraining results by 4 points.

> In this paper we present our contribution to the TSAR-2022 Shared Task on Lexical Simplification of the EMNLP 2022 Workshop on Text Simplification, Accessibility, and Readability. Our approach builds on and extends the unsupervised lexical simplification system with pretrained encoders (LSBert) system in the following ways: For the subtask of simplification candidate selection, it utilizes a RoBERTa transformer language model and expands the size of the generated candidate list. For subsequent substitution ranking, it introduces a new feature weighting scheme and adopts a candidate filtering method based on textual entailment to maximize semantic similarity between the target word and its simplification. Our best-performing system improves LSBert by 5.9% accuracy and achieves second place out of 33 ranked solutions.

> We introduce a new image segmentation task, called Entity Segmentation (ES), which aims to segment all visual entities (objects and stuffs) in an image without predicting their semantic labels. By removing the need of class label prediction, the models trained for such task can focus more on improving segmentation quality. It has many practical applications such as image manipulation and editing where the quality of segmentation masks is crucial but class labels are less important. We conduct the first-ever study to investigate the feasibility of convolutional center-based representation to segment things and stuffs in a unified manner, and show that such representation fits exceptionally well in the context of ES. More specifically, we propose a CondInst-like fully-convolutional architecture with two novel modules specifically designed to exploit the class-agnostic and non-overlapping requirements of ES. Experiments show that the models designed and trained for ES significantly outperforms popular class-specific panoptic segmentation models in terms of segmentation quality. Moreover, an ES model can be easily trained on a combination of multiple datasets without the need to resolve label conflicts in dataset merging, and the model trained for ES on one or more datasets can generalize very well to other test datasets of unseen domains. The code has been released at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Entity/.

> Making sense of multiple modalities can yield a more comprehensive description of real-world phenomena. However, learning the co-representation of diverse modalities is still a long-standing endeavor in emerging machine learning applications and research. Previous generative approaches for multimodal input approximate a joint-modality posterior by uni-modality posteriors as product-of-experts (PoE) or mixture-of-experts (MoE). We argue that these approximations lead to a defective bound for the optimization process and loss of semantic connection among modalities. This paper presents a novel variational method on sets called the Set Multimodal VAE (SMVAE) for learning a multimodal latent space while handling the missing modality problem. By modeling the joint-modality posterior distribution directly, the proposed SMVAE learns to exchange information between multiple modalities and compensate for the drawbacks caused by factorization. In public datasets of various domains, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable to order-agnostic cross-modal generation while achieving outstanding performance compared to the state-of-the-art multimodal methods. The source code for our method is available online https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SMVAE-9B3C/.

> Functionality and dialogue experience are two important factors of task-oriented dialogue systems. Conventional approaches with closed schema (e.g., conversational semantic parsing) often fail as both the functionality and dialogue experience are strongly constrained by the underlying schema. We introduce a new paradigm for task-oriented dialogue - Dialog2API - to greatly expand the functionality and provide seamless dialogue experience. The conversational model interacts with the environment by generating and executing programs triggering a set of pre-defined APIs. The model also manages the dialogue policy and interact with the user through generating appropriate natural language responses. By allowing generating free-form programs, Dialog2API supports composite goals by combining different APIs, whereas unrestricted program revision provides natural and robust dialogue experience. To facilitate Dialog2API, the core model is provided with API documents, an execution environment and optionally some example dialogues annotated with programs. We propose an approach tailored for the Dialog2API, where the dialogue states are represented by a stack of programs, with most recently mentioned program on the top of the stack. Dialog2API can work with many application scenarios such as software automation and customer service. In this paper, we construct a dataset for AWS S3 APIs and present evaluation results of in-context learning baselines.

> The abductive natural language inference task ($\alpha$NLI) is proposed to infer the most plausible explanation between the cause and the event. In the $\alpha$NLI task, two observations are given, and the most plausible hypothesis is asked to pick out from the candidates. Existing methods model the relation between each candidate hypothesis separately and penalize the inference network uniformly. In this paper, we argue that it is unnecessary to distinguish the reasoning abilities among correct hypotheses; and similarly, all wrong hypotheses contribute the same when explaining the reasons of the observations. Therefore, we propose to group instead of ranking the hypotheses and design a structural loss called ``joint softmax focal loss'' in this paper. Based on the observation that the hypotheses are generally semantically related, we have designed a novel interactive language model aiming at exploiting the rich interaction among competing hypotheses. We name this new model for $\alpha$NLI: Interactive Model with Structural Loss (IMSL). The experimental results show that our IMSL has achieved the highest performance on the RoBERTa-large pretrained model, with ACC and AUC results increased by about 1\% and 5\% respectively.

> Document-level relation extraction faces two overlooked challenges: long-tail problem and multi-label problem. Previous work focuses mainly on obtaining better contextual representations for entity pairs, hardly address the above challenges. In this paper, we analyze the co-occurrence correlation of relations, and introduce it into DocRE task for the first time. We argue that the correlations can not only transfer knowledge between data-rich relations and data-scarce ones to assist in the training of tailed relations, but also reflect semantic distance guiding the classifier to identify semantically close relations for multi-label entity pairs. Specifically, we use relation embedding as a medium, and propose two co-occurrence prediction sub-tasks from both coarse- and fine-grained perspectives to capture relation correlations. Finally, the learned correlation-aware embeddings are used to guide the extraction of relational facts. Substantial experiments on two popular DocRE datasets are conducted, and our method achieves superior results compared to baselines. Insightful analysis also demonstrates the potential of relation correlations to address the above challenges.

> Online learning platforms provide diverse questions to gauge the learners' understanding of different concepts. The repository of questions has to be constantly updated to ensure a diverse pool of questions to conduct assessments for learners. However, it is impossible for the academician to manually skim through the large repository of questions to check for duplicates when onboarding new questions from external sources. Hence, we propose a tool QDup in this paper that can surface near-duplicate and semantically related questions without any supervised data. The proposed tool follows an unsupervised hybrid pipeline of statistical and neural approaches for incorporating different nuances in similarity for the task of question duplicate detection. We demonstrate that QDup can detect near-duplicate questions and also suggest related questions for practice with remarkable accuracy and speed from a large repository of questions.

> Code generation models have achieved impressive performance. However, they tend to be brittle as slight edits to a prompt could lead to very different generations; these robustness properties, critical for user experience when deployed in real-life applications, are not well understood. Most existing works on robustness in text or code tasks have focused on classification, while robustness in generation tasks is an uncharted area and to date there is no comprehensive benchmark for robustness in code generation. In this paper, we propose ReCode, a comprehensive robustness evaluation benchmark for code generation models. We customize over 30 transformations specifically for code on docstrings, function and variable names, code syntax, and code format. They are carefully designed to be natural in real-life coding practice, preserve the original semantic meaning, and thus provide multifaceted assessments of a model's robustness performance. With human annotators, we verified that over 90% of the perturbed prompts do not alter the semantic meaning of the original prompt. In addition, we define robustness metrics for code generation models considering the worst-case behavior under each type of perturbation, taking advantage of the fact that executing the generated code can serve as objective evaluation. We demonstrate ReCode on SOTA models using HumanEval, MBPP, as well as function completion tasks derived from them. Interesting observations include: better robustness for CodeGen over InCoder and GPT-J; models are most sensitive to syntax perturbations; more challenging robustness evaluation on MBPP over HumanEval.

> Memes are powerful means for effective communication on social media. Their effortless amalgamation of viral visuals and compelling messages can have far-reaching implications with proper marketing. Previous research on memes has primarily focused on characterizing their affective spectrum and detecting whether the meme's message insinuates any intended harm, such as hate, offense, racism, etc. However, memes often use abstraction, which can be elusive. Here, we introduce a novel task - EXCLAIM, generating explanations for visual semantic role labeling in memes. To this end, we curate ExHVV, a novel dataset that offers natural language explanations of connotative roles for three types of entities - heroes, villains, and victims, encompassing 4,680 entities present in 3K memes. We also benchmark ExHVV with several strong unimodal and multimodal baselines. Moreover, we posit LUMEN, a novel multimodal, multi-task learning framework that endeavors to address EXCLAIM optimally by jointly learning to predict the correct semantic roles and correspondingly to generate suitable natural language explanations. LUMEN distinctly outperforms the best baseline across 18 standard natural language generation evaluation metrics. Our systematic evaluation and analyses demonstrate that characteristic multimodal cues required for adjudicating semantic roles are also helpful for generating suitable explanations.

> Semantic communications seeks to transfer information from a source while conveying a desired meaning to its destination. We model the transmitter-receiver functionalities as an autoencoder followed by a task classifier that evaluates the meaning of the information conveyed to the receiver. The autoencoder consists of an encoder at the transmitter to jointly model source coding, channel coding, and modulation, and a decoder at the receiver to jointly model demodulation, channel decoding and source decoding. By augmenting the reconstruction loss with a semantic loss, the two deep neural networks (DNNs) of this encoder-decoder pair are interactively trained with the DNN of the semantic task classifier. This approach effectively captures the latent feature space and reliably transfers compressed feature vectors with a small number of channel uses while keeping the semantic loss low. We identify the multi-domain security vulnerabilities of using the DNNs for semantic communications. Based on adversarial machine learning, we introduce test-time (targeted and non-targeted) adversarial attacks on the DNNs by manipulating their inputs at different stages of semantic communications. As a computer vision attack, small perturbations are injected to the images at the input of the transmitter's encoder. As a wireless attack, small perturbations signals are transmitted to interfere with the input of the receiver's decoder. By launching these stealth attacks individually or more effectively in a combined form as a multi-domain attack, we show that it is possible to change the semantics of the transferred information even when the reconstruction loss remains low. These multi-domain adversarial attacks pose as a serious threat to the semantics of information transfer (with larger impact than conventional jamming) and raise the need of defense methods for the safe adoption of semantic communications.

> State-of-the-art automatic augmentation methods (e.g., AutoAugment and RandAugment) for visual recognition tasks diversify training data using a large set of augmentation operations. The range of magnitudes of many augmentation operations (e.g., brightness and contrast) is continuous. Therefore, to make search computationally tractable, these methods use fixed and manually-defined magnitude ranges for each operation, which may lead to sub-optimal policies. To answer the open question on the importance of magnitude ranges for each augmentation operation, we introduce RangeAugment that allows us to efficiently learn the range of magnitudes for individual as well as composite augmentation operations. RangeAugment uses an auxiliary loss based on image similarity as a measure to control the range of magnitudes of augmentation operations. As a result, RangeAugment has a single scalar parameter for search, image similarity, which we simply optimize via linear search. RangeAugment integrates seamlessly with any model and learns model- and task-specific augmentation policies. With extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset across different networks, we show that RangeAugment achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art automatic augmentation methods with 4-5 times fewer augmentation operations. Experimental results on semantic segmentation, object detection, foundation models, and knowledge distillation further shows RangeAugment's effectiveness.

> While deep learning succeeds in a wide range of tasks, it highly depends on the massive collection of annotated data which is expensive and time-consuming. To lower the cost of data annotation, active learning has been proposed to interactively query an oracle to annotate a small proportion of informative samples in an unlabeled dataset. Inspired by the fact that the samples with higher loss are usually more informative to the model than the samples with lower loss, in this paper we present a novel deep active learning approach that queries the oracle for data annotation when the unlabeled sample is believed to incorporate high loss. The core of our approach is a measurement Temporal Output Discrepancy (TOD) that estimates the sample loss by evaluating the discrepancy of outputs given by models at different optimization steps. Our theoretical investigation shows that TOD lower-bounds the accumulated sample loss thus it can be used to select informative unlabeled samples. On basis of TOD, we further develop an effective unlabeled data sampling strategy as well as an unsupervised learning criterion for active learning. Due to the simplicity of TOD, our methods are efficient, flexible, and task-agnostic. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performances than the state-of-the-art active learning methods on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. In addition, we show that TOD can be utilized to select the best model of potentially the highest testing accuracy from a pool of candidate models.

PINN models aim to combine the knowledge of physical systems and data-driven machine learning models. This is done by training a neural network to minimize the residuals of the governing equations in sample points. In this work, our flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations with some approximations. There are two main novelties in this paper. First, we design our model to assume that the flow is periodic in time, which is not feasible in conventional simulation methods. Second, we evaluate the benefit of resampling the function evaluation points during training, which has a near zero computational cost and has been verified to improve the final model, especially for small batch sizes. Finally, we discuss some limitations of the approximations used in the Navier-Stokes equations regarding the modeling of turbulence and how it interacts with PINNs.

> When a human communicates with a machine using natural language on the web and online, how can it understand the human's intention and semantic context of their talk? This is an important AI task as it enables the machine to construct a sensible answer or perform a useful action for the human. Meaning is represented at the sentence level, identification of which is known as intent detection, and at the word level, a labelling task called slot filling. This dual-level joint task requires innovative thinking about natural language and deep learning network design, and as a result, many approaches and models have been proposed and applied.   This tutorial will discuss how the joint task is set up and introduce Spoken Language Understanding/Natural Language Understanding (SLU/NLU) with Deep Learning techniques. We will cover the datasets, experiments and metrics used in the field. We will describe how the machine uses the latest NLP and Deep Learning techniques to address the joint task, including recurrent and attention-based Transformer networks and pre-trained models (e.g. BERT). We will then look in detail at a network that allows the two levels of the task, intent classification and slot filling, to interact to boost performance explicitly.

> The Internet of Senses (IoS) holds the promise of flawless telepresence-style communication for all human `receptors' and therefore blurs the difference of virtual and real environments. We commence by highlighting the compelling use cases empowered by the IoS and also the key network requirements. We then elaborate on how the emerging semantic communications and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) paradigms along with 6G technologies may satisfy the requirements of IoS use cases. On one hand, semantic communications can be applied for extracting meaningful and significant information and hence efficiently exploit the resources and for harnessing a priori information at the receiver to satisfy IoS requirements. On the other hand, AI/ML facilitates frugal network resource management by making use of the enormous amount of data generated in IoS edge nodes and devices, as well as by optimizing the IoS performance via intelligent agents. However, the intelligent agents deployed at the edge are not completely aware of each others' decisions and the environments of each other, hence they operate in a partially rather than fully observable environment. Therefore, we present a case study of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) for improving the User Equipment (UE) throughput and energy consumption, as they are imperative for IoS use cases, using Reinforcement Learning for astutely activating and deactivating the component carriers in carrier aggregation. Finally, we outline the challenges and open issues of IoS implementations and employing semantic communications, edge intelligence as well as learning under partial observability in the IoS context.

> Large language models have ushered in a golden age of semantic parsing. The seq2seq paradigm allows for open-schema and abstractive attribute and relation extraction given only small amounts of finetuning data. Language model pretraining has simultaneously enabled great strides in natural language inference, reasoning about entailment and implication in free text. These advances motivate us to construct ImPaKT, a dataset for open-schema information extraction, consisting of around 2500 text snippets from the C4 corpus, in the shopping domain (product buying guides), professionally annotated with extracted attributes, types, attribute summaries (attribute schema discovery from idiosyncratic text), many-to-one relations between compound and atomic attributes, and implication relations. We release this data in hope that it will be useful in fine tuning semantic parsers for information extraction and knowledge base construction across a variety of domains. We evaluate the power of this approach by fine-tuning the open source UL2 language model on a subset of the dataset, extracting a set of implication relations from a corpus of product buying guides, and conducting human evaluations of the resulting predictions.

> We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot semantic parsing. Semantic parsing involves mapping natural language utterances to task-specific meaning representations. Language models are generally trained on the publicly available text and code and cannot be expected to directly generalize to domain-specific parsing tasks in a zero-shot setting. In this work, we propose ZEROTOP, a zero-shot task-oriented parsing method that decomposes a semantic parsing problem into a set of abstractive and extractive question-answering (QA) problems, enabling us to leverage the ability of LLMs to zero-shot answer reading comprehension questions. For each utterance, we prompt the LLM with questions corresponding to its top-level intent and a set of slots and use the LLM generations to construct the target meaning representation. We observe that current LLMs fail to detect unanswerable questions; and as a result, cannot handle questions corresponding to missing slots. To address this problem, we fine-tune a language model on public QA datasets using synthetic negative samples. Experimental results show that our QA-based decomposition paired with the fine-tuned LLM can correctly parse ~16% of utterances in the MTOP dataset without requiring any annotated data.

Though effective for various tasks, in this paper, we show that they are potentially a problematic factor underlying all GNN models for learning on certain datasets, as they force the node representations similar, making the nodes gradually lose their identity and become indistinguishable. Hence, we augment the aggregation operations with their dual, i.e. diversification operators that make the node more distinct and preserve the identity. Such augmentation replaces the aggregation with a two-channel filtering process that, in theory, is beneficial for enriching the node representations. In practice, the proposed two-channel filters can be easily patched on existing GNN methods with diverse training strategies, including spectral and spatial (message passing) methods. In the experiments, we observe desired characteristics of the models and significant performance boost upon the baselines on 9 node classification tasks.

> Semantic communication is not focused on improving the accuracy of transmitted symbols, but is concerned with expressing the expected meaning that the symbol sequence exactly carries. However, the measurement of semantic messages and their corresponding codebook generation are still open issues. Expansion, which integrates simple things into a complex system and even generates intelligence, is truly consistent with the evolution of the human language system. We apply this idea to the semantic communication system, quantifying semantic transmission by symbol sequences and investigating the semantic information system in a similar way as Shannon's method for digital communication systems. This work is the first to discuss semantic expansion and knowledge collision in the semantic information framework. Some important theoretical results are presented, including the relationship between semantic expansion and the transmission information rate. We believe such a semantic information framework may provide a new paradigm for semantic communications, and semantic expansion and knowledge collision will be the cornerstone of semantic information theory.

> Candidate axiom scoring is the task of assessing the acceptability of a candidate axiom against the evidence provided by known facts or data. The ability to score candidate axioms reliably is required for automated schema or ontology induction, but it can also be valuable for ontology and/or knowledge graph validation. Accurate axiom scoring heuristics are often computationally expensive, which is an issue if you wish to use them in iterative search techniques like level-wise generate-and-test or evolutionary algorithms, which require scoring a large number of candidate axioms. We address the problem of developing a predictive model as a substitute for reasoning that predicts the possibility score of candidate class axioms and is quick enough to be employed in such situations. We use a semantic similarity measure taken from an ontology's subsumption structure for this purpose. We show that the approach provided in this work can accurately learn the possibility scores of candidate OWL class axioms and that it can do so for a variety of OWL class axioms.

> Biometric data privacy is becoming a major concern for many organizations in the age of big data, particularly in the ICT sector, because it may be easily exploited in apps. Most apps utilize biometrics by accessing common application programming interfaces (APIs); hence, we aim to categorize their usage. The categorization based on behavior may be closely correlated with the sensitive processing of a user's biometric data, hence highlighting crucial biometric data privacy assessment concerns. We propose PABAU, Privacy Analysis of Biometric API Usage. PABAU learns semantic features of methods in biometric APIs and uses them to detect and categorize the usage of biometric API implementation in the software according to their privacy-related behaviors. This technique bridges the communication and background knowledge gap between technical and non-technical individuals in organizations by providing an automated method for both parties to acquire a rapid understanding of the essential behaviors of biometric API in apps, as well as future support to data protection officers (DPO) with legal documentation, such as conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

> A critical step in sharing semantic content online is to map the structural data source to a public domain ontology. This problem is denoted as the Relational-To-Ontology Mapping Problem (Rel2Onto). A huge effort and expertise are required for manually modeling the semantics of data. Therefore, an automatic approach for learning the semantics of a data source is desirable. Most of the existing work studies the semantic annotation of source attributes. However, although critical, the research for automatically inferring the relationships between attributes is very limited. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semantically annotating structured data sources using machine learning, graph matching and modified frequent subgraph mining to amend the candidate model. In our work, Knowledge graph is used as prior knowledge. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms two state-of-the-art solutions in tricky cases where only a few semantic models are known.

> Spectral geometric methods have brought revolutionary changes to the field of geometry processing. Of particular interest is the study of the Laplacian spectrum as a compact, isometry and permutation-invariant representation of a shape. Some recent works show how the intrinsic geometry of a full shape can be recovered from its spectrum, but there are approaches that consider the more challenging problem of recovering the geometry from the spectral information of partial shapes. In this paper, we propose a possible way to fill this gap. We introduce a learning-based method to estimate the Laplacian spectrum of the union of partial non-rigid 3D shapes, without actually computing the 3D geometry of the union or any correspondence between those partial shapes. We do so by operating purely in the spectral domain and by defining the union operation between short sequences of eigenvalues. We show that the approximated union spectrum can be used as-is to reconstruct the complete geometry [MRC*19], perform region localization on a template [RTO*19] and retrieve shapes from a database, generalizing ShapeDNA [RWP06] to work with partialities. Working with eigenvalues allows us to deal with unknown correspondence, different sampling, and different discretizations (point clouds and meshes alike), making this operation especially robust and general. Our approach is data-driven and can generalize to isometric and non-isometric deformations of the surface, as long as these stay within the same semantic class (e.g., human bodies or horses), as well as to partiality artifacts not seen at training time.

> This paper presents an open and comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art contributions to self-supervised monocular depth estimation. This includes pretraining, backbone, architectural design choices and loss functions. Many papers in this field claim novelty in either architecture design or loss formulation. However, simply updating the backbone of historical systems results in relative improvements of 25%, allowing them to outperform the majority of existing systems. A systematic evaluation of papers in this field was not straightforward. The need to compare like-with-like in previous papers means that longstanding errors in the evaluation protocol are ubiquitous in the field. It is likely that many papers were not only optimized for particular datasets, but also for errors in the data and evaluation criteria. To aid future research in this area, we release a modular codebase (https://github.com/jspenmar/monodepth_benchmark), allowing for easy evaluation of alternate design decisions against corrected data and evaluation criteria. We re-implement, validate and re-evaluate 16 state-of-the-art contributions and introduce a new dataset (SYNS-Patches) containing dense outdoor depth maps in a variety of both natural and urban scenes. This allows for the computation of informative metrics in complex regions such as depth boundaries.

> Fuzz testing is often automated, but also frequently augmented by experts who insert themselves into the workflow in a greedy search for bugs. In this paper, we propose Homo in Machina, or HM-fuzzing, in which analyses guide the manual efforts, maximizing benefit. As one example of this paradigm, we introduce compartment analysis. Compartment analysis uses a whole-program dominator analysis to estimate the utility of reaching new code, and combines this with a dynamic analysis indicating drastically under-covered edges guarding that code. This results in a prioritized list of compartments, i.e., large, uncovered parts of the program semantically partitioned and largely unreachable given the current corpus of inputs under consideration. A human can use this categorization and ranking of compartments directly to focus manual effort, finding or fashioning inputs that make the compartments available for future fuzzing. We evaluate the effect of compartment analysis on seven projects within the OSS-Fuzz corpus where we see coverage improvements over AFL++ as high as 94%, with a median of 13%. We further observe that the determination of compartments is highly stable and thus can be done early in a fuzzing campaign, maximizing the potential for impact.

> Contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective self-supervised learning method for images and videos. Most successful approaches are based on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and use different views of an instance as positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives, that are considered as noise. However, several instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. A good data representation should contain relations between the instances, or semantic similarity and dissimilarity, that contrastive learning harms by considering all negatives as noise. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive one that brings the positives closer and estimates a continuous distribution to push or pull negative instances based on their learned similarities. We validate empirically our approach on both image and video representation learning. We show that SCE performs competitively with the state of the art on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol for fewer pretraining epochs and that it generalizes to several downstream image tasks. We also show that SCE reaches state-of-the-art results for pretraining video representation and that the learned representation can generalize to video downstream tasks.

- `2212.11205v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11205v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11205v1)

> This paper highlights vulnerabilities of deep learning-driven semantic communications to backdoor (Trojan) attacks. Semantic communications aims to convey a desired meaning while transferring information from a transmitter to its receiver. An encoder-decoder pair that is represented by two deep neural networks (DNNs) as part of an autoencoder is trained to reconstruct signals such as images at the receiver by transmitting latent features of small size over a limited number of channel uses. In the meantime, another DNN of a semantic task classifier at the receiver is jointly trained with the autoencoder to check the meaning conveyed to the receiver. The complex decision space of the DNNs makes semantic communications susceptible to adversarial manipulations. In a backdoor (Trojan) attack, the adversary adds triggers to a small portion of training samples and changes the label to a target label. When the transfer of images is considered, the triggers can be added to the images or equivalently to the corresponding transmitted or received signals. In test time, the adversary activates these triggers by providing poisoned samples as input to the encoder (or decoder) of semantic communications. The backdoor attack can effectively change the semantic information transferred for the poisoned input samples to a target meaning. As the performance of semantic communications improves with the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of channel uses, the success of the backdoor attack increases as well. Also, increasing the Trojan ratio in training data makes the attack more successful. In the meantime, the effect of this attack on the unpoisoned input samples remains limited. Overall, this paper shows that the backdoor attack poses a serious threat to semantic communications and presents novel design guidelines to preserve the meaning of transferred information in the presence of backdoor attacks.

> We consider the problem of embedding character-entity relationships from the reduced semantic space of narratives, proposing and evaluating the assumption that these relationships hold under a reflection operation. We analyze this assumption and compare the approach to a baseline state-of-the-art model with a unique evaluation that simulates efficacy on a downstream clustering task with human-created labels. Although our model creates clusters that achieve Silhouette scores of -.084, outperforming the baseline -.227, our analysis reveals that the models approach the task much differently and perform well on very different examples. We conclude that our assumption might be useful for specific types of data and should be evaluated on a wider range of tasks.

> We present X-Decoder, a generalized decoding model that can predict pixel-level segmentation and language tokens seamlessly. X-Decodert takes as input two types of queries: (i) generic non-semantic queries and (ii) semantic queries induced from text inputs, to decode different pixel-level and token-level outputs in the same semantic space. With such a novel design, X-Decoder is the first work that provides a unified way to support all types of image segmentation and a variety of vision-language (VL) tasks. Further, our design enables seamless interactions across tasks at different granularities and brings mutual benefits by learning a common and rich pixel-level visual-semantic understanding space, without any pseudo-labeling. After pretraining on a mixed set of a limited amount of segmentation data and millions of image-text pairs, X-Decoder exhibits strong transferability to a wide range of downstream tasks in both zero-shot and finetuning settings. Notably, it achieves (1) state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary segmentation and referring segmentation on eight datasets; (2) better or competitive finetuned performance to other generalist and specialist models on segmentation and VL tasks; and (3) flexibility for efficient finetuning and novel task composition (e.g., referring captioning and image editing).

> Deep learning techniques have made considerable progress in image inpainting, restoration, and reconstruction in the last few years. Image outpainting, also known as image extrapolation, lacks attention and practical approaches to be fulfilled, owing to difficulties caused by large-scale area loss and less legitimate neighboring information. These difficulties have made outpainted images handled by most of the existing models unrealistic to human eyes and spatially inconsistent. When upsampling through deconvolution to generate fake content, the naive generation methods may lead to results lacking high-frequency details and structural authenticity. Therefore, as our novelties to handle image outpainting problems, we introduce structural prior as a condition to optimize the generation quality and a new semantic embedding term to enhance perceptual sanity. we propose a deep learning method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and condition edges as structural prior in order to assist the generation. We use a multi-phase adversarial training scheme that comprises edge inference training, contents inpainting training, and joint training. The newly added semantic embedding loss is proved effective in practice.

> Generalisation to unseen contexts remains a challenge for embodied navigation agents. In the context of semantic audio-visual navigation (SAVi) tasks, the notion of generalisation should include both generalising to unseen indoor visual scenes as well as generalising to unheard sounding objects. However, previous SAVi task definitions do not include evaluation conditions on truly novel sounding objects, resorting instead to evaluating agents on unheard sound clips of known objects; meanwhile, previous SAVi methods do not include explicit mechanisms for incorporating domain knowledge about object and region semantics. These weaknesses limit the development and assessment of models' abilities to generalise their learned experience. In this work, we introduce the use of knowledge-driven scene priors in the semantic audio-visual embodied navigation task: we combine semantic information from our novel knowledge graph that encodes object-region relations, spatial knowledge from dual Graph Encoder Networks, and background knowledge from a series of pre-training tasks -- all within a reinforcement learning framework for audio-visual navigation. We also define a new audio-visual navigation sub-task, where agents are evaluated on novel sounding objects, as opposed to unheard clips of known objects. We show improvements over strong baselines in generalisation to unseen regions and novel sounding objects, within the Habitat-Matterport3D simulation environment, under the SoundSpaces task.

> Traditional approaches to RL have focused on learning decision policies directly from episodic decisions, while slowly and implicitly learning the semantics of compositional representations needed for generalization. While some approaches have been adopted to refine representations via auxiliary self-supervised losses while simultaneously learning decision policies, learning compositional representations from hand-designed and context-independent self-supervised losses (multi-view) still adapts relatively slowly to the real world, which contains many non-IID subspaces requiring rapid distribution shift in both time and spatial attention patterns at varying levels of abstraction. In contrast, supervised language model cascades have shown the flexibility to adapt to many diverse manifolds, and hints of self-learning needed for autonomous task transfer. However, to date, transfer methods for language models like few-shot learning and fine-tuning still require human supervision and transfer learning using self-learning methods has been underexplored. We propose a self-supervised loss policy called contrastive distillation which manifests latent variables with high mutual information with both source and target tasks from weights to tokens. We show how this outperforms common methods of transfer learning and suggests a useful design axis of trading off compute for generalizability for online transfer. Contrastive distillation is improved through sampling from memory and suggests a simple algorithm for more efficiently sampling negative examples for contrastive losses than random sampling.

> Although homomorphic encryption can be incorporated into neural network layers for securing machine learning tasks, such as confidential inference over encrypted data samples and encrypted local models in federated learning, the computational overhead has been an Achilles heel. This paper proposes a caching protocol, namely CHEM, such that tensor ciphertexts can be constructed from a pool of cached radixes rather than carrying out expensive encryption operations. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that CHEM is semantically secure and can be parameterized with straightforward analysis under practical assumptions. Experimental results on three popular public data sets show that adopting CHEM only incurs sub-second overhead and yet reduces the encryption cost by 48%--89% for encoding input data samples in confidential inference and 67%--87% for encoding local models in federated learning, respectively.

> We describe a tracking technique for Linux devices, exploiting a new TCP source port generation mechanism recently introduced to the Linux kernel. This mechanism is based on an algorithm, standardized in RFC 6056, for boosting security by better randomizing port selection. Our technique detects collisions in a hash function used in the said algorithm, based on sampling TCP source ports generated in an attacker-prescribed manner. These hash collisions depend solely on a per-device key, and thus the set of collisions forms a device ID that allows tracking devices across browsers, browser privacy modes, containers, and IPv4/IPv6 networks (including some VPNs). It can distinguish among devices with identical hardware and software, and lasts until the device restarts.   We implemented this technique and then tested it using tracking servers in two different locations and with Linux devices on various networks. We also tested it on an Android device that we patched to introduce the new port selection algorithm. The tracking technique works in real-life conditions, and we report detailed findings about it, including its dwell time, scalability, and success rate in different network types. We worked with the Linux kernel team to mitigate the exploit, resulting in a security patch introduced in May 2022 to the Linux kernel, and we provide recommendations for better securing the port selection algorithm in the paper.

> The rapid development of cyber-physical systems creates an increasing demand for a general approach to risk, especially considering how physical and digital components affect the processes of the system itself. In risk analytics and management, risk propagation is a central technique, which allows the calculation of the cascading effect of risk within a system and supports risk mitigation activities. However, one open challenge is to devise a process-aware risk propagation solution that can be used to assess the impact of risk at different levels of abstraction, accounting for actors, processes, physical-digital objects, and their interrelations. To address this challenge, we propose a process-aware risk propagation approach that builds on two main components: i. an ontology, which supports functionalities typical of Semantic Web technologies (SWT), and semantics-based intelligent systems, representing a system with processes and objects having different levels of abstraction, and ii. a method to calculate the propagation of risk within the given system. We implemented our approach in a proof-of-concept tool, which was validated and demonstrated in the cybersecurity domain.

> We propose an end-to-end framework to measure people's vital signs including Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) and Blood Pressure (BP) based on the rPPG methodology from the video of a user's face captured with a smartphone camera. We extract face landmarks with a deep learning-based neural network model in real-time. Multiple face patches also called Regions-of-Interest (RoIs) are extracted by using the predicted face landmarks. Several filters are applied to reduce the noise from the RoIs in the extracted cardiac signals called Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signal. The measurements of HR, HRV and SpO2 are validated on two public rPPG datasets namely the TokyoTech rPPG and the Pulse Rate Detection (PURE) datasets, on which our models achieved the following Mean Absolute Errors (MAE): a) for HR, 1.73Beats-Per-Minute (bpm) and 3.95bpm respectively; b) for HRV, 18.55ms and 25.03ms respectively, and c) for SpO2, an MAE of 1.64% on the PURE dataset. We validated our end-to-end rPPG framework, ReViSe, in daily living environment, and thereby created the Video-HR dataset. Our HR estimation model achieved an MAE of 2.49bpm on this dataset. Since no publicly available rPPG datasets existed for BP measurement with face videos, we used a dataset with signals from fingertip sensor to train our deep learning-based BP estimation model and also created our own video dataset, Video-BP. On our Video-BP dataset, our BP estimation model achieved an MAE of 6.7mmHg for Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and an MAE of 9.6mmHg for Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP). ReViSe framework has been validated on datasets with videos recorded in daily living environment as opposed to less noisy laboratory environment as reported by most state-of-the-art techniques.

> Large-scale pretraining instills large amounts of knowledge in deep neural networks. This, in turn, improves the generalization behavior of these models in downstream tasks. What exactly are the limits to the generalization benefits of large-scale pretraining? Here, we report observations from some simple experiments aimed at addressing this question in the context of two semantic parsing tasks involving natural language, SCAN and COGS. We show that language models pretrained exclusively with non-English corpora, or even with programming language corpora, significantly improve out-of-distribution generalization in these benchmarks, compared with models trained from scratch, even though both benchmarks are English-based. This demonstrates the surprisingly broad transferability of pretrained representations and knowledge. Pretraining with a large-scale protein sequence prediction task, on the other hand, mostly deteriorates the generalization performance in SCAN and COGS, suggesting that pretrained representations do not transfer universally and that there are constraints on the similarity between the pretraining and downstream domains for successful transfer. Finally, we show that larger models are harder to train from scratch and their generalization accuracy is lower when trained up to convergence on the relatively small SCAN and COGS datasets, but the benefits of large-scale pretraining become much clearer with larger models.

> Finding an initial noise vector that produces an input image when fed into the diffusion process (known as inversion) is an important problem in denoising diffusion models (DDMs), with applications for real image editing. The state-of-the-art approach for real image editing with inversion uses denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) to deterministically noise the image to the intermediate state along the path that the denoising would follow given the original conditioning. However, DDIM inversion for real images is unstable as it relies on local linearization assumptions, which result in the propagation of errors, leading to incorrect image reconstruction and loss of content. To alleviate these problems, we propose Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT), an inversion method that draws inspiration from affine coupling layers. EDICT enables mathematically exact inversion of real and model-generated images by maintaining two coupled noise vectors which are used to invert each other in an alternating fashion. Using Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, we demonstrate that EDICT successfully reconstructs real images with high fidelity. On complex image datasets like MS-COCO, EDICT reconstruction significantly outperforms DDIM, improving the mean square error of reconstruction by a factor of two. Using noise vectors inverted from real images, EDICT enables a wide range of image edits--from local and global semantic edits to image stylization--while maintaining fidelity to the original image structure. EDICT requires no model training/finetuning, prompt tuning, or extra data and can be combined with any pretrained DDM. Code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/EDICT.

> Many applications of representation learning, such as privacy preservation, algorithmic fairness, and domain adaptation, desire explicit control over semantic information being discarded. This goal is formulated as satisfying two objectives: maximizing utility for predicting a target attribute while simultaneously being invariant (independent) to a known semantic attribute. Solutions to invariant representation learning (IRepL) problems lead to a trade-off between utility and invariance when they are competing. While existing works study bounds on this trade-off, two questions remain outstanding: 1) What is the exact trade-off between utility and invariance? and 2) What are the encoders (mapping the data to a representation) that achieve the trade-off, and how can we estimate it from training data? This paper addresses these questions for IRepLs in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)s. Under the assumption that the distribution of a low-dimensional projection of high-dimensional data is approximately normal, we derive a closed-form solution for the global optima of the underlying optimization problem for encoders in RKHSs. This yields closed formulae for a near-optimal trade-off, corresponding optimal representation dimensionality, and the corresponding encoder(s). We also numerically quantify the trade-off on representative problems and compare them to those achieved by baseline IRepL algorithms.

> The availability of frequent and cost-free satellite images is in growing demand in the research world. Such satellite constellations as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 provide a massive amount of valuable data daily. However, the discrepancy in the sensors' characteristics of these satellites makes it senseless to use a segmentation model trained on either dataset and applied to another, which is why domain adaptation techniques have recently become an active research area in remote sensing. In this paper, an experiment of domain adaptation through style-transferring is conducted using the HRSemI2I model to narrow the sensor discrepancy between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. This paper's main contribution is analyzing the expediency of that approach by comparing the results of segmentation using domain-adapted images with those without adaptation. The HRSemI2I model, adjusted to work with 6-band imagery, shows significant intersection-over-union performance improvement for both mean and per class metrics. A second contribution is providing different schemes of generalization between two label schemes - NALCMS 2015 and CORINE. The first scheme is standardization through higher-level land cover classes, and the second is through harmonization validation in the field.

> An important problem with machine learning is that when label number n>2, it is very difficult to construct and optimize a group of learning functions, and we wish that optimized learning functions are still useful when prior distribution P(x) (where x is an instance) is changed. To resolve this problem, the semantic information G theory, Logical Bayesian Inference (LBI), and a group of Channel Matching (CM) algorithms together form a systematic solution. A semantic channel in the G theory consists of a group of truth functions or membership functions. In comparison with likelihood functions, Bayesian posteriors, and Logistic functions used by popular methods, membership functions can be more conveniently used as learning functions without the above problem. In Logical Bayesian Inference (LBI), every label's learning is independent. For Multilabel learning, we can directly obtain a group of optimized membership functions from a big enough sample with labels, without preparing different samples for different labels. A group of Channel Matching (CM) algorithms is developed for machine learning. For the Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) classification of three classes with Gaussian distributions on a two-dimensional feature space, 2-3 iterations can make mutual information between three classes and three labels surpass 99% of the MMI for most initial partitions. For mixture models, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is improved and becomes the CM-EM algorithm, which can outperform the EM algorithm when mixture ratios are imbalanced, or local convergence exists. The CM iteration algorithm needs to combine neural networks for MMI classifications on high-dimensional feature spaces. LBI needs further studies for the unification of statistics and logic.

> Medical image segmentation methods typically rely on numerous dense annotated images for model training, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to collect. To alleviate this burden, weakly supervised techniques have been exploited to train segmentation models with less expensive annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel point-supervised contrastive variance method (PSCV) for medical image semantic segmentation, which only requires one pixel-point from each organ category to be annotated. The proposed method trains the base segmentation network by using a novel contrastive variance (CV) loss to exploit the unlabeled pixels and a partial cross-entropy loss on the labeled pixels. The CV loss function is designed to exploit the statistical spatial distribution properties of organs in medical images and their variance distribution map representations to enforce discriminative predictions over the unlabeled pixels. Experimental results on two standard medical image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on point-supervised medical image semantic segmentation tasks.

> We investigate how humans perform the task of dubbing video content from one language into another, leveraging a novel corpus of 319.57 hours of video from 54 professionally produced titles. This is the first such large-scale study we are aware of. The results challenge a number of assumptions commonly made in both qualitative literature on human dubbing and machine-learning literature on automatic dubbing, arguing for the importance of vocal naturalness and translation quality over commonly emphasized isometric (character length) and lip-sync constraints, and for a more qualified view of the importance of isochronic (timing) constraints. We also find substantial influence of the source-side audio on human dubs through channels other than the words of the translation, pointing to the need for research on ways to preserve speech characteristics, as well as semantic transfer such as emphasis/emotion, in automatic dubbing systems.

> Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often utilize external knowledge graphs (KGs) to introduce rich semantic information and recommend relevant items through natural language dialogues. However, original KGs employed in existing CRSs are often incomplete and sparse, which limits the reasoning capability in recommendation. Moreover, only few of existing studies exploit the dialogue context to dynamically refine knowledge from KGs for better recommendation. To address the above issues, we propose the Variational Reasoning over Incomplete KGs Conversational Recommender (VRICR). Our key idea is to incorporate the large dialogue corpus naturally accompanied with CRSs to enhance the incomplete KGs; and perform dynamic knowledge reasoning conditioned on the dialogue context. Specifically, we denote the dialogue-specific subgraphs of KGs as latent variables with categorical priors for adaptive knowledge graphs refactor. We propose a variational Bayesian method to approximate posterior distributions over dialogue-specific subgraphs, which not only leverages the dialogue corpus for restructuring missing entity relations but also dynamically selects knowledge based on the dialogue context. Finally, we infuse the dialogue-specific subgraphs to decode the recommendation and responses. We conduct experiments on two benchmark CRSs datasets. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.

> Incorrect placement of methods within classes is a typical code smell called Feature Envy, which causes additional maintenance and cost during evolution. To remove this design flaw, several Move Method refactoring tools have been proposed. To the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art related techniques can be broadly divided into two categories: the first line is non-machine-learning-based approaches built on software measurement, while the selection and thresholds of software metrics heavily rely on expert knowledge. The second line is machine learning-based approaches, which suggest Move Method refactoring by learning to extract features from code information. However, most approaches in this line treat different forms of code information identically, disregarding their significant variation on data analysis. In this paper, we propose an approach to recommend Move Method refactoring named RMove by automatically learning structural and semantic representation from code fragment respectively. We concatenate these representations together and further train the machine learning classifiers to guide the movement of method to suitable classes. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets. The results show that our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art refactoring tools including PathMove, JDeodorant, and JMove in effectiveness and usefulness. The results also unveil useful findings and provide new insights that benefit other types of feature envy refactoring techniques.

> Overfitting is a problem in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that causes poor generalization of models on unseen data. To remediate this problem, many new and diverse data augmentation methods (DA) have been proposed to supplement or generate more training data, and thereby increase its quality. In this work, we propose a new data augmentation algorithm: VoronoiPatches (VP). We primarily utilize non-linear recombination of information within an image, fragmenting and occluding small information patches. Unlike other DA methods, VP uses small convex polygon-shaped patches in a random layout to transport information around within an image. Sudden transitions created between patches and the original image can, optionally, be smoothed. In our experiments, VP outperformed current DA methods regarding model variance and overfitting tendencies. We demonstrate data augmentation utilizing non-linear re-combination of information within images, and non-orthogonal shapes and structures improves CNN model robustness on unseen data.

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the semi-supervised node classification task, where a key point lies in how to sufficiently leverage the limited but valuable label information. Most of the classical GNNs solely use the known labels for computing the classification loss at the output. In recent years, several methods have been designed to additionally utilize the labels at the input. One part of the methods augment the node features via concatenating or adding them with the one-hot encodings of labels, while other methods optimize the graph structure by assuming neighboring nodes tend to have the same label. To bring into full play the rich information of labels, in this paper, we present a label-enhanced learning framework for GNNs, which first models each label as a virtual center for intra-class nodes and then jointly learns the representations of both nodes and labels. Our approach could not only smooth the representations of nodes belonging to the same class, but also explicitly encode the label semantics into the learning process of GNNs. Moreover, a training node selection technique is provided to eliminate the potential label leakage issue and guarantee the model generalization ability. Finally, an adaptive self-training strategy is proposed to iteratively enlarge the training set with more reliable pseudo labels and distinguish the importance of each pseudo-labeled node during the model training process. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate our approach can not only consistently outperform the state-of-the-arts, but also effectively smooth the representations of intra-class nodes.

> Several works have proven that finetuning is an applicable approach for debiasing contextualized word embeddings. Similarly, discrete prompts with semantic meanings have shown to be effective in debiasing tasks. With unfixed mathematical representation at the token level, continuous prompts usually surpass discrete ones at providing a pre-trained language model (PLM) with additional task-specific information. Despite this, relatively few efforts have been made to debias PLMs by prompt tuning with continuous prompts compared to its discrete counterpart. Furthermore, for most debiasing methods that alter a PLM's original parameters, a major problem is the need to not only decrease the bias in the PLM but also to ensure that the PLM does not lose its representation ability. Finetuning methods typically have a hard time maintaining this balance, as they tend to violently remove meanings of attribute words. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, a method to debias PLMs using prompt tuning while maintaining the delicate balance between removing biases and ensuring representation ability. To achieve this, we propose a new training criterion inspired by manifold learning and equip it with an explicit debiasing term to optimize prompt tuning. In addition, we conduct several experiments with regard to the reliability, quality, and quantity of a previously proposed attribute training corpus in order to obtain a clearer prototype of a certain attribute, which indicates the attribute's position and relative distances to other words on the manifold. We evaluate ADEPT on several widely acknowledged debiasing benchmarks and downstream tasks, and find that it achieves competitive results while maintaining (and in some cases even improving) the PLM's representation ability. We further visualize words' correlation before and after debiasing a PLM, and give some possible explanations for the visible effects.

> Vision Transformers have shown great promise recently for many vision tasks due to the insightful architecture design and attention mechanism. By revisiting the self-attention responses in Transformers, we empirically observe two interesting issues. First, Vision Transformers present a queryirrelevant behavior at deep layers, where the attention maps exhibit nearly consistent contexts in global scope, regardless of the query patch position (also head-irrelevant). Second, the attention maps are intrinsically sparse, few tokens dominate the attention weights; introducing the knowledge from ConvNets would largely smooth the attention and enhance the performance. Motivated by above observations, we generalize self-attention formulation to abstract a queryirrelevant global context directly and further integrate the global context into convolutions. The resulting model, a Fully Convolutional Vision Transformer (i.e., FCViT), purely consists of convolutional layers and firmly inherits the merits of both attention mechanism and convolutions, including dynamic property, weight sharing, and short- and long-range feature modeling, etc. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FCViT. With less than 14M parameters, our FCViT-S12 outperforms related work ResT-Lite by 3.7% top1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. When scaling FCViT to larger models, we still perform better than previous state-of-the-art ConvNeXt with even fewer parameters. FCViT-based models also demonstrate promising transferability to downstream tasks, like object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

> In order for artificial neural networks to begin accurately mimicking biological ones, they must be able to adapt to new exigencies without forgetting what they have learned from previous training. Lifelong learning approaches to artificial neural networks attempt to strive towards this goal, yet have not progressed far enough to be realistically deployed for natural language processing tasks. The proverbial roadblock of catastrophic forgetting still gate-keeps researchers from an adequate lifelong learning model. While efforts are being made to quell catastrophic forgetting, there is a lack of research that looks into the importance of class ordering when training on new classes for incremental learning. This is surprising as the ordering of "classes" that humans learn is heavily monitored and incredibly important. While heuristics to develop an ideal class order have been researched, this paper examines class ordering as it relates to priming as a scheme for incremental class learning. By examining the connections between various methods of priming found in humans and how those are mimicked yet remain unexplained in life-long machine learning, this paper provides a better understanding of the similarities between our biological systems and the synthetic systems while simultaneously improving current practices to combat catastrophic forgetting. Through the merging of psychological priming practices with class ordering, this paper is able to identify a generalizable method for class ordering in NLP incremental learning tasks that consistently outperforms random class ordering.

> Name ambiguity is common in academic digital libraries, such as multiple authors having the same name. This creates challenges for academic data management and analysis, thus name disambiguation becomes necessary. The procedure of name disambiguation is to divide publications with the same name into different groups, each group belonging to a unique author. A large amount of attribute information in publications makes traditional methods fall into the quagmire of feature selection. These methods always select attributes artificially and equally, which usually causes a negative impact on accuracy. The proposed method is mainly based on representation learning for heterogeneous networks and clustering and exploits the self-attention technology to solve the problem. The presentation of publications is a synthesis of structural and semantic representations. The structural representation is obtained by meta-path-based sampling and a skip-gram-based embedding method, and meta-path level attention is introduced to automatically learn the weight of each feature. The semantic representation is generated using NLP tools. Our proposal performs better in terms of name disambiguation accuracy compared with baselines and the ablation experiments demonstrate the improvement by feature selection and the meta-path level attention in our method. The experimental results show the superiority of our new method for capturing the most attributes from publications and reducing the impact of redundant information.

> Objective. The impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on patients' healthcare quality and the disparity is well-known. Many SDoH items are not coded in structured forms in electronic health records. These items are often captured in free-text clinical notes, but there are limited methods for automatically extracting them. We explore a multi-stage pipeline involving named entity recognition (NER), relation classification (RC), and text classification methods to extract SDoH information from clinical notes automatically.   Materials and Methods. The study uses the N2C2 Shared Task data, which was collected from two sources of clinical notes: MIMIC-III and University of Washington Harborview Medical Centers. It contains 4480 social history sections with full annotation for twelve SDoHs. In order to handle the issue of overlapping entities, we developed a novel marker-based NER model. We used it in a multi-stage pipeline to extract SDoH information from clinical notes.   Results. Our marker-based system outperformed the state-of-the-art span-based models at handling overlapping entities based on the overall Micro-F1 score performance. It also achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to the shared task methods.   Conclusion. The major finding of this study is that the multi-stage pipeline effectively extracts SDoH information from clinical notes. This approach can potentially improve the understanding and tracking of SDoHs in clinical settings. However, error propagation may be an issue, and further research is needed to improve the extraction of entities with complex semantic meanings and low-resource entities using external knowledge.

> Learning with noisy labels is a vital topic for practical deep learning as models should be robust to noisy open-world datasets in the wild. The state-of-the-art noisy label learning approach JoCoR fails when faced with a large ratio of noisy labels. Moreover, selecting small-loss samples can also cause error accumulation as once the noisy samples are mistakenly selected as small-loss samples, they are more likely to be selected again. In this paper, we try to deal with error accumulation in noisy label learning from both model and data perspectives. We introduce mean point ensemble to utilize a more robust loss function and more information from unselected samples to reduce error accumulation from the model perspective. Furthermore, as the flip images have the same semantic meaning as the original images, we select small-loss samples according to the loss values of flip images instead of the original ones to reduce error accumulation from the data perspective. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and large-scale Clothing1M show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art noisy label learning methods with different levels of label noise. Our method can also be seamlessly combined with other noisy label learning methods to further improve their performance and generalize well to other tasks.

> Document summarization aims to create a precise and coherent summary of a text document. Many deep learning summarization models are developed mainly for English, often requiring a large training corpus and efficient pre-trained language models and tools. However, English summarization models for low-resource Indian languages are often limited by rich morphological variation, syntax, and semantic differences. In this paper, we propose GAE-ISumm, an unsupervised Indic summarization model that extracts summaries from text documents. In particular, our proposed model, GAE-ISumm uses Graph Autoencoder (GAE) to learn text representations and a document summary jointly. We also provide a manually-annotated Telugu summarization dataset TELSUM, to experiment with our model GAE-ISumm. Further, we experiment with the most publicly available Indian language summarization datasets to investigate the effectiveness of GAE-ISumm on other Indian languages. Our experiments of GAE-ISumm in seven languages make the following observations: (i) it is competitive or better than state-of-the-art results on all datasets, (ii) it reports benchmark results on TELSUM, and (iii) the inclusion of positional and cluster information in the proposed model improved the performance of summaries.

> Adversarial patch is an important form of real-world adversarial attack that brings serious risks to the robustness of deep neural networks. Previous methods generate adversarial patches by either optimizing their perturbation values while fixing the pasting position or manipulating the position while fixing the patch's content. This reveals that the positions and perturbations are both important to the adversarial attack. For that, in this paper, we propose a novel method to simultaneously optimize the position and perturbation for an adversarial patch, and thus obtain a high attack success rate in the black-box setting. Technically, we regard the patch's position, the pre-designed hyper-parameters to determine the patch's perturbations as the variables, and utilize the reinforcement learning framework to simultaneously solve for the optimal solution based on the rewards obtained from the target model with a small number of queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Face Recognition (FR) task, and results on four representative FR models show that our method can significantly improve the attack success rate and query efficiency. Besides, experiments on the commercial FR service and physical environments confirm its practical application value. We also extend our method to the traffic sign recognition task to verify its generalization ability.

> Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection can be used in deep learning-based applications to reject outlier samples from being unreliably classified by deep neural networks. Learning to classify between OOD and in-distribution samples is difficult because data comprising the former is extremely diverse. It has been observed that an auxiliary OOD dataset is most effective in training a "rejection" network when its samples are semantically similar to in-distribution images. We first deduce that OOD images are perceived by a deep neural network to be semantically similar to in-distribution samples when they share a common background, as deep networks are observed to incorrectly classify such images with high confidence. We then propose a simple yet effective Key In-distribution feature Replacement BY inpainting (KIRBY) procedure that constructs a surrogate OOD dataset by replacing class-discriminative features of in-distribution samples with marginal background features. The procedure can be implemented using off-the-shelf vision algorithms, where each step within the algorithm is shown to make the surrogate data increasingly similar to in-distribution data. Design choices in each step are studied extensively, and an exhaustive comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrates KIRBY's competitiveness on various benchmarks.

> Automatic segmentation of kidney and kidney tumour in Computed Tomography (CT) images is essential, as it uses less time as compared to the current gold standard of manual segmentation. However, many hospitals are still reliant on manual study and segmentation of CT images by medical practitioners because of its higher accuracy. Thus, this study focuses on the development of an approach for automatic kidney and kidney tumour segmentation in contrast-enhanced CT images. A method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed, where a 3D U-Net segmentation model was developed and trained to delineate the kidney and kidney tumour from CT scans. Each CT image was pre-processed before inputting to the CNN, and the effect of down-sampled and patch-wise input images on the model performance was analysed. The proposed method was evaluated on the publicly available 2021 Kidney and Kidney Tumour Segmentation Challenge (KiTS21) dataset. The method with the best performing model recorded an average training Dice score of 0.6129, with the kidney and kidney tumour Dice scores of 0.7923 and 0.4344, respectively. For testing, the model obtained a kidney Dice score of 0.8034, and a kidney tumour Dice score of 0.4713, with an average Dice score of 0.6374.

> Complex knowledge base question answering can be achieved by converting questions into sequences of predefined actions. However, there is a significant semantic and structural gap between natural language and action sequences, which makes this conversion difficult. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-enhanced complex question answering framework, called ALCQA, which mitigates this gap through question-to-action alignment and question-to-question alignment. We train a question rewriting model to align the question and each action, and utilize a pretrained language model to implicitly align the question and KG artifacts. Moreover, considering that similar questions correspond to similar action sequences, we retrieve top-k similar question-answer pairs at the inference stage through question-to-question alignment and propose a novel reward-guided action sequence selection strategy to select from candidate action sequences. We conduct experiments on CQA and WQSP datasets, and the results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and obtains a 9.88\% improvements in the F1 metric on CQA dataset.

> Deep learning has achieved great success in the past few years. However, the performance of deep learning is likely to impede in face of non-IID situations. Domain generalization (DG) enables a model to generalize to an unseen test distribution, i.e., to learn domain-invariant representations. In this paper, we argue that domain-invariant features should be originating from both internal and mutual sides. Internal invariance means that the features can be learned with a single domain and the features capture intrinsic semantics of data, i.e., the property within a domain, which is agnostic to other domains. Mutual invariance means that the features can be learned with multiple domains (cross-domain) and the features contain common information, i.e., the transferable features w.r.t. other domains. We then propose DIFEX for Domain-Invariant Feature EXploration. DIFEX employs a knowledge distillation framework to capture the high-level Fourier phase as the internally-invariant features and learn cross-domain correlation alignment as the mutually-invariant features. We further design an exploration loss to increase the feature diversity for better generalization. Extensive experiments on both time-series and visual benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DIFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance.

> The combination of conduct, emotion, motivation, and thinking is referred to as personality. To shortlist candidates more effectively, many organizations rely on personality predictions. The firm can hire or pick the best candidate for the desired job description by grouping applicants based on the necessary personality preferences. A model is created to identify applicants' personality types so that employers may find qualified candidates by examining a person's facial expression, speech intonation, and resume. Additionally, the paper emphasises detecting the changes in employee behaviour. Employee attitudes and behaviour towards each set of questions are being examined and analysed. Here, the K-Modes clustering method is used to predict employee well-being, including job pressure, the working environment, and relationships with peers, utilizing the OCEAN Model and the CNN algorithm in the AVI-AI administrative system. Findings imply that AVIs can be used for efficient candidate screening with an AI decision agent. The study of the specific field is beyond the current explorations and needed to be expanded with deeper models and new configurations that can patch extremely complex operations.

> Creating an essay based on a few given topics is a challenging NLP task. Although several effective methods for this problem, topic-to-essay generation, have appeared recently, there is still much room for improvement, especially in terms of the coverage of the given topics and the coherence of the generated text. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called TegFormer which utilizes the Transformer architecture where the encoder is enriched with domain-specific contexts while the decoder is enhanced by a large-scale pre-trained language model. Specifically, a \emph{Topic-Extension} layer capturing the interaction between the given topics and their domain-specific contexts is plugged into the encoder. Since the given topics are usually concise and sparse, such an additional layer can bring more topic-related semantics in to facilitate the subsequent natural language generation. Moreover, an \emph{Embedding-Fusion} module that combines the domain-specific word embeddings learnt from the given corpus and the general-purpose word embeddings provided by a GPT-2 model pre-trained on massive text data is integrated into the decoder. Since GPT-2 is at a much larger scale, it contains a lot more implicit linguistic knowledge which would help the decoder to produce more grammatical and readable text. Extensive experiments have shown that the pieces of text generated by TegFormer have better topic coverage and higher text coherence than those from SOTA topic-to-essay techniques, according to automatic and human evaluations. As revealed by ablation studies, both the Topic-Extension layer and the Embedding-Fusion module contribute substantially to TegFormer's performance advantage.

> The current optical communication systems minimize bit or symbol errors without considering the semantic meaning behind digital bits, thus transmitting a lot of unnecessary information. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a semantic optical fiber communication (SOFC) system. Instead of encoding information into bits for transmission, semantic information is extracted from the source using deep learning. The generated semantic symbols are then directly transmitted through an optical fiber. Compared with the bit-based structure, the SOFC system achieved higher information compression and a more stable performance, especially in the low received optical power regime, and enhanced the robustness against optical link impairments. This work introduces an intelligent optical communication system at the human analytical thinking level, which is a significant step toward a breakthrough in the current optical communication architecture.

> Text-to-SQL semantic parsing is an important NLP task, which greatly facilitates the interaction between users and the database and becomes the key component in many human-computer interaction systems. Much recent progress in text-to-SQL has been driven by large-scale datasets, but most of them are centered on English. In this work, we present MultiSpider, the largest multilingual text-to-SQL dataset which covers seven languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese). Upon MultiSpider, we further identify the lexical and structural challenges of text-to-SQL (caused by specific language properties and dialect sayings) and their intensity across different languages. Experimental results under three typical settings (zero-shot, monolingual and multilingual) reveal a 6.1% absolute drop in accuracy in non-English languages. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are conducted to understand the reason for the performance drop of each language. Besides the dataset, we also propose a simple schema augmentation framework SAVe (Schema-Augmentation-with-Verification), which significantly boosts the overall performance by about 1.8% and closes the 29.5% performance gap across languages.

> Video Super-Resolution (VSR) aims to restore high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) videos. Existing VSR techniques usually recover HR frames by extracting pertinent textures from nearby frames with known degradation processes. Despite significant progress, grand challenges are remained to effectively extract and transmit high-quality textures from high-degraded low-quality sequences, such as blur, additive noises, and compression artifacts. In this work, a novel Frequency-Transformer (FTVSR) is proposed for handling low-quality videos that carry out self-attention in a combined space-time-frequency domain. First, video frames are split into patches and each patch is transformed into spectral maps in which each channel represents a frequency band. It permits a fine-grained self-attention on each frequency band, so that real visual texture can be distinguished from artifacts. Second, a novel dual frequency attention (DFA) mechanism is proposed to capture the global frequency relations and local frequency relations, which can handle different complicated degradation processes in real-world scenarios. Third, we explore different self-attention schemes for video processing in the frequency domain and discover that a ``divided attention'' which conducts a joint space-frequency attention before applying temporal-frequency attention, leads to the best video enhancement quality. Extensive experiments on three widely-used VSR datasets show that FTVSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on different low-quality videos with clear visual margins.

- `2212.13589v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13589v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13589v1)

> Classification using supervised learning requires annotating a large amount of classes-balanced data for model training and testing. This has practically limited the scope of applications with supervised learning, in particular deep learning. To address the issues associated with limited and imbalanced data, this paper introduces a sample-efficient co-supervised learning paradigm (SEC-CGAN), in which a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is trained alongside the classifier and supplements semantics-conditioned, confidence-aware synthesized examples to the annotated data during the training process. In this setting, the CGAN not only serves as a co-supervisor but also provides complementary quality examples to aid the classifier training in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SEC-CGAN outperforms the external classifier GAN (EC-GAN) and a baseline ResNet-18 classifier. For the comparison, all classifiers in above methods adopt the ResNet-18 architecture as the backbone. Particularly, for the Street View House Numbers dataset, using the 5% of training data, a test accuracy of 90.26% is achieved by SEC-CGAN as opposed to 88.59% by EC-GAN and 87.17% by the baseline classifier; for the highway image dataset, using the 10% of training data, a test accuracy of 98.27% is achieved by SEC-CGAN, compared to 97.84% by EC-GAN and 95.52% by the baseline classifier.

> Unlike existing knowledge distillation methods focus on the baseline settings, where the teacher models and training strategies are not that strong and competing as state-of-the-art approaches, this paper presents a method dubbed DIST to distill better from a stronger teacher. We empirically find that the discrepancy of predictions between the student and a stronger teacher may tend to be fairly severer. As a result, the exact match of predictions in KL divergence would disturb the training and make existing methods perform poorly. In this paper, we show that simply preserving the relations between the predictions of teacher and student would suffice, and propose a correlation-based loss to capture the intrinsic inter-class relations from the teacher explicitly. Besides, considering that different instances have different semantic similarities to each class, we also extend this relational match to the intra-class level. Our method is simple yet practical, and extensive experiments demonstrate that it adapts well to various architectures, model sizes and training strategies, and can achieve state-of-the-art performance consistently on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks.

> Vision transformers (ViTs) encoding an image as a sequence of patches bring new paradigms for semantic segmentation.We present an efficient framework of representation separation in local-patch level and global-region level for semantic segmentation with ViTs. It is targeted for the peculiar over-smoothness of ViTs in semantic segmentation, and therefore differs from current popular paradigms of context modeling and most existing related methods reinforcing the advantage of attention. We first deliver the decoupled two-pathway network in which another pathway enhances and passes down local-patch discrepancy complementary to global representations of transformers. We then propose the spatially adaptive separation module to obtain more separate deep representations and the discriminative cross-attention which yields more discriminative region representations through novel auxiliary supervisions. The proposed methods achieve some impressive results: 1) incorporated with large-scale plain ViTs, our methods achieve new state-of-the-art performances on five widely used benchmarks; 2) using masked pre-trained plain ViTs, we achieve 68.9% mIoU on Pascal Context, setting a new record; 3) pyramid ViTs integrated with the decoupled two-pathway network even surpass the well-designed high-resolution ViTs on Cityscapes; 4) the improved representations by our framework have favorable transferability in images with natural corruptions. The codes will be released publicly.

> Efficient continual learning in humans is enabled by a rich set of neurophysiological mechanisms and interactions between multiple memory systems. The brain efficiently encodes information in non-overlapping sparse codes, which facilitates the learning of new associations faster with controlled interference with previous associations. To mimic sparse coding in DNNs, we enforce activation sparsity along with a dropout mechanism which encourages the model to activate similar units for semantically similar inputs and have less overlap with activation patterns of semantically dissimilar inputs. This provides us with an efficient mechanism for balancing the reusability and interference of features, depending on the similarity of classes across tasks. Furthermore, we employ sparse coding in a multiple-memory replay mechanism. Our method maintains an additional long-term semantic memory that aggregates and consolidates information encoded in the synaptic weights of the working model. Our extensive evaluation and characteristics analysis show that equipped with these biologically inspired mechanisms, the model can further mitigate forgetting.

> To achieve accurate and low-cost 3D object detection, existing methods propose to benefit camera-based multi-view detectors with spatial cues provided by the LiDAR modality, e.g., dense depth supervision and bird-eye-view (BEV) feature distillation. However, they directly conduct point-to-point mimicking from LiDAR to camera, which neglects the inner-geometry of foreground targets and suffers from the modal gap between 2D-3D features. In this paper, we propose the learning scheme of Target Inner-Geometry from the LiDAR modality into camera-based BEV detectors for both dense depth and BEV features, termed as TiG-BEV. First, we introduce an inner-depth supervision module to learn the low-level relative depth relations between different foreground pixels. This enables the camera-based detector to better understand the object-wise spatial structures. Second, we design an inner-feature BEV distillation module to imitate the high-level semantics of different keypoints within foreground targets. To further alleviate the BEV feature gap between two modalities, we adopt both inter-channel and inter-keypoint distillation for feature-similarity modeling. With our target inner-geometry distillation, TiG-BEV can effectively boost BEVDepth by +2.3% NDS and +2.4% mAP, along with BEVDet by +9.1% NDS and +10.3% mAP on nuScenes val set.

> It is of critical importance to be aware of the historical discrimination embedded in the data and to consider a fairness measure to reduce bias throughout the predictive modeling pipeline. Given various notions of fairness defined in the literature, investigating the correlation and interaction among metrics is vital for addressing unfairness. Practitioners and data scientists should be able to comprehend each metric and examine their impact on one another given the context, use case, and regulations. Exploring the combinatorial space of different metrics for such examination is burdensome. To alleviate the burden of selecting fairness notions for consideration, we propose a framework that estimates the correlation among fairness notions. Our framework consequently identifies a set of diverse and semantically distinct metrics as representative for a given context. We propose a Monte-Carlo sampling technique for computing the correlations between fairness metrics by indirect and efficient perturbation in the model space. Using the estimated correlations, we then find a subset of representative metrics. The paper proposes a generic method that can be generalized to any arbitrary set of fairness metrics. We showcase the validity of the proposal using comprehensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets.

> Efficient custom pooling techniques that can aggressively trim the dimensions of a feature map and thereby reduce inference compute and memory footprint for resource-constrained computer vision applications have recently gained significant traction. However, prior pooling works extract only the local context of the activation maps, limiting their effectiveness. In contrast, we propose a novel non-local self-attentive pooling method that can be used as a drop-in replacement to the standard pooling layers, such as max/average pooling or strided convolution. The proposed self-attention module uses patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel restoration, followed by sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism efficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during down-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and detection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) pooling techniques. In particular, we surpass the test accuracy of existing pooling techniques on different variants of MobileNet-V2 on ImageNet by an average of 1.2%. With the aggressive down-sampling of the activation maps in the initial layers (providing up to 22x reduction in memory consumption), our approach achieves 1.43% higher test accuracy compared to SOTA techniques with iso-memory footprints. This enables the deployment of our models in memory-constrained devices, such as micro-controllers (without losing significant accuracy), because the initial activation maps consume a significant amount of on-chip memory for high-resolution images required for complex vision tasks. Our proposed pooling method also leverages the idea of channel pruning to further reduce memory footprints.

> Deep learning has been widely used for protein engineering. However, it is limited by the lack of sufficient experimental data to train an accurate model for predicting the functional fitness of high-order mutants. Here, we develop SESNet, a supervised deep-learning model to predict the fitness for protein mutants by leveraging both sequence and structure information, and exploiting attention mechanism. Our model integrates local evolutionary context from homologous sequences, the global evolutionary context encoding rich semantic from the universal protein sequence space and the structure information accounting for the microenvironment around each residue in a protein. We show that SESNet outperforms state-of-the-art models for predicting the sequence-function relationship on 26 deep mutational scanning datasets. More importantly, we propose a data augmentation strategy by leveraging the data from unsupervised models to pre-train our model. After that, our model can achieve strikingly high accuracy in prediction of the fitness of protein mutants, especially for the higher order variants (> 4 mutation sites), when finetuned by using only a small number of experimental mutation data (<50). The strategy proposed is of great practical value as the required experimental effort, i.e., producing a few tens of experimental mutation data on a given protein, is generally affordable by an ordinary biochemical group and can be applied on almost any protein.

> Debugging takes up a significant portion of developer time. As a result, automated debugging techniques including Fault Localization (FL) and Automated Program Repair (APR) have garnered significant attention due to their potential to aid developers in debugging tasks. Despite intensive research on these subjects, we are unaware of a theoretic framework that highlights the principles behind automated debugging and allows abstract analysis of techniques. Such a framework would heighten our understanding of the endeavor and provide a way to formally analyze techniques and approaches. To this end, we first propose a Bayesian framework of understanding automated repair and find that in conjunction with a concrete statement of the objective of automated debugging, we can recover maximal fault localization formulae from prior work, as well as analyze existing APR techniques and their underlying assumptions.   As a means of empirically demonstrating our framework, we further propose BAPP, a Bayesian Patch Prioritization technique that incorporates intermediate program values to analyze likely patch locations and repair actions, with its core equations being derived by our Bayesian framework. We find that incorporating program values allows BAPP to identify correct patches more precisely: when applied to the patches generated by kPAR, the rankings produced by BAPP reduce the number of required patch validation by 68% and consequently reduce the repair time by 34 minutes on average. Further, BAPP improves the precision of FL, increasing acc@5 on the studied bugs from 8 to 11. These results highlight the potential of value-cognizant automated debugging techniques, and further validates our theoretical framework. Finally, future directions that the framework suggests are provided.

> Recent progress in deep learning (DL)-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has led to a new paradigm of semantic communications. Two salient features of DeepJSCC-based semantic communications are the exploitation of semantic-aware features directly from the source signal, and the discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) of these features. Compared with traditional digital communications, semantic communications with DeepJSCC provide superior reconstruction performance at the receiver and graceful degradation with diminishing channel quality, but also exhibit a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in the transmitted signal. An open question has been whether the gains of DeepJSCC come from the additional freedom brought by the high-PAPR continuous-amplitude signal. In this paper, we address this question by exploring three PAPR reduction techniques in the application of image transmission. We confirm that the superior image reconstruction performance of DeepJSCC-based semantic communications can be retained while the transmitted PAPR is suppressed to an acceptable level. This observation is an important step towards the implementation of DeepJSCC in practical semantic communication systems.

> Deep Metric Learning (DML) learns a non-linear semantic embedding from input data that brings similar pairs together while keeping dissimilar data away from each other. To this end, many different methods are proposed in the last decade with promising results in various applications. The success of a DML algorithm greatly depends on its loss function. However, no loss function is perfect, and it deals only with some aspects of an optimal similarity embedding. Besides, the generalizability of the DML on unseen categories during the test stage is an important matter that is not considered by existing loss functions. To address these challenges, we propose novel approaches to combine different losses built on top of a shared deep feature extractor. The proposed ensemble of losses enforces the deep model to extract features that are consistent with all losses. Since the selected losses are diverse and each emphasizes different aspects of an optimal semantic embedding, our effective combining methods yield a considerable improvement over any individual loss and generalize well on unseen categories. Here, there is no limitation in choosing loss functions, and our methods can work with any set of existing ones. Besides, they can optimize each loss function as well as its weight in an end-to-end paradigm with no need to adjust any hyper-parameter. We evaluate our methods on some popular datasets from the machine vision domain in conventional Zero-Shot-Learning (ZSL) settings. The results are very encouraging and show that our methods outperform all baseline losses by a large margin in all datasets.

> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully used in classifying digital images but have been less successful in classifying images with meanings that are not linear combinations of their visualized features, like images of artwork. Moreover, it is unknown what additional features must be included into DNNs, so that they can possibly classify using features beyond visually displayed features, like color, size, and form. Non-displayed features are important in abstract representations, reasoning, and understanding ambiguous expressions, which are arguably topics less studied by current AI methods. This paper attempts to identify capabilities that are related to semantic processing, a current limitation of DNNs. The proposed methodology identifies the missing capabilities by comparing the process of understanding Mondrian's paintings with the process of understanding electronic circuit designs, another creative problem solving instance. The compared entities are cognitive architectures that attempt to loosely mimic cognitive activities. The paper offers a detailed presentation of the characteristics of the architectural components, like goals, concepts, ideas, rules, procedures, beliefs, expectations, and outcomes. To explain the usefulness of the methodology, the paper discusses a new, three-step computational method to distinguish Mondrian's paintings from other artwork. The method includes in a backward order the cognitive architecture's components that operate only with the characteristics of the available data.

> Deep-learning (DL) compilers such as TVM and TensorRT are increasingly being used to optimize deep neural network (DNN) models to meet performance, resource utilization and other requirements. Bugs in these compilers can result in models whose semantics differ from the original ones, producing incorrect results that corrupt the correctness of downstream applications. However, finding bugs in these compilers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a new fuzz testing approach for finding bugs in deep-learning compilers. Our core approach consists of (i) generating diverse yet valid DNN test models that can exercise a large part of the compiler's transformation logic using light-weight operator specifications; (ii) performing gradient-based search to find model inputs that avoid any floating-point exceptional values during model execution, reducing the chance of missed bugs or false alarms; and (iii) using differential testing to identify bugs. We implemented this approach in NNSmith which has found 72 new bugs for TVM, TensorRT, ONNXRuntime, and PyTorch to date. Of these 58 have been confirmed and 51 have been fixed by their respective project maintainers.

> Despite great recent advances achieved by deep neural networks (DNNs), they are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Intensive research efforts have been made to improve the robustness of DNNs; however, most empirical defenses can be adaptively attacked again, and the theoretically certified robustness is limited, especially on large-scale datasets. One potential root cause of such vulnerabilities for DNNs is that although they have demonstrated powerful expressiveness, they lack the reasoning ability to make robust and reliable predictions. In this paper, we aim to integrate domain knowledge to enable robust learning with the reasoning paradigm. In particular, we propose a certifiably robust learning with reasoning pipeline (CARE), which consists of a learning component and a reasoning component. Concretely, we use a set of standard DNNs to serve as the learning component to make semantic predictions, and we leverage the probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov logic networks (MLN), to serve as the reasoning component to enable knowledge/logic reasoning. However, it is known that the exact inference of MLN (reasoning) is #P-complete, which limits the scalability of the pipeline. To this end, we propose to approximate the MLN inference via variational inference based on an efficient expectation maximization algorithm. In particular, we leverage graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to encode the posterior distribution during variational inference and update the parameters of GCNs (E-step) and the weights of knowledge rules in MLN (M-step) iteratively. We conduct extensive experiments on different datasets and show that CARE achieves significantly higher certified robustness compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. We additionally conducted different ablation studies to demonstrate the empirical robustness of CARE and the effectiveness of different knowledge integration.

> We introduce a linguistically enhanced combination of pre-training methods for transformers. The pre-training objectives include POS-tagging, synset prediction based on semantic knowledge graphs, and parent prediction based on dependency parse trees. Our approach achieves competitive results on the Natural Language Inference task, compared to the state of the art. Specifically for smaller models, the method results in a significant performance boost, emphasizing the fact that intelligent pre-training can make up for fewer parameters and help building more efficient models. Combining POS-tagging and synset prediction yields the overall best results.

> There still remains an extreme performance gap between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when training from scratch on small datasets, which is concluded to the lack of inductive bias. In this paper, we further consider this problem and point out two weaknesses of ViTs in inductive biases, that is, the spatial relevance and diverse channel representation. First, on spatial aspect, objects are locally compact and relevant, thus fine-grained feature needs to be extracted from a token and its neighbors. While the lack of data hinders ViTs to attend the spatial relevance. Second, on channel aspect, representation exhibits diversity on different channels. But the scarce data can not enable ViTs to learn strong enough representation for accurate recognition. To this end, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Vision Transformer (DHVT) as the solution to enhance the two inductive biases. On spatial aspect, we adopt a hybrid structure, in which convolution is integrated into patch embedding and multi-layer perceptron module, forcing the model to capture the token features as well as their neighboring features. On channel aspect, we introduce a dynamic feature aggregation module in MLP and a brand new "head token" design in multi-head self-attention module to help re-calibrate channel representation and make different channel group representation interacts with each other. The fusion of weak channel representation forms a strong enough representation for classification. With this design, we successfully eliminate the performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, and our DHVT achieves a series of state-of-the-art performance with a lightweight model, 85.68% on CIFAR-100 with 22.8M parameters, 82.3% on ImageNet-1K with 24.0M parameters.

> In knowledge graph completion (KGC), predicting triples involving emerging entities and/or relations, which are unseen when the KG embeddings are learned, has become a critical challenge. Subgraph reasoning with message passing is a promising and popular solution. Some recent methods have achieved good performance, but they (i) usually can only predict triples involving unseen entities alone, failing to address more realistic fully inductive situations with both unseen entities and unseen relations, and (ii) often conduct message passing over the entities with the relation patterns not fully utilized. In this study, we propose a new method named RMPI which uses a novel Relational Message Passing network for fully Inductive KGC. It passes messages directly between relations to make full use of the relation patterns for subgraph reasoning with new techniques on graph transformation, graph pruning, relation-aware neighborhood attention, addressing empty subgraphs, etc., and can utilize the relation semantics defined in the ontological schema of KG. Extensive evaluation on multiple benchmarks has shown the effectiveness of techniques involved in RMPI and its better performance compared with the existing methods that support fully inductive KGC. RMPI is also comparable to the state-of-the-art partially inductive KGC methods with very promising results achieved. Our codes and data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/RMPI.

> We present a novel dataset named as HPointLoc, specially designed for exploring capabilities of visual place recognition in indoor environment and loop detection in simultaneous localization and mapping. The loop detection sub-task is especially relevant when a robot with an on-board RGB-D camera can drive past the same place (``Point") at different angles. The dataset is based on the popular Habitat simulator, in which it is possible to generate photorealistic indoor scenes using both own sensor data and open datasets, such as Matterport3D. To study the main stages of solving the place recognition problem on the HPointLoc dataset, we proposed a new modular approach named as PNTR. It first performs an image retrieval with the Patch-NetVLAD method, then extracts keypoints and matches them using R2D2, LoFTR or SuperPoint with SuperGlue, and finally performs a camera pose optimization step with TEASER++. Such a solution to the place recognition problem has not been previously studied in existing publications. The PNTR approach has shown the best quality metrics on the HPointLoc dataset and has a high potential for real use in localization systems for unmanned vehicles. The proposed dataset and framework are publicly available: https://github.com/metra4ok/HPointLoc.

> Denoising Diffusion models are gaining increasing popularity in the field of generative modeling for several reasons, including the simple and stable training, the excellent generative quality, and the solid probabilistic foundation. In this article, we address the problem of {\em embedding} an image into the latent space of Denoising Diffusion Models, that is finding a suitable ``noisy'' image whose denoising results in the original image. We particularly focus on Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models due to the deterministic nature of their reverse diffusion process. As a side result of our investigation, we gain a deeper insight into the structure of the latent space of diffusion models, opening interesting perspectives on its exploration, the definition of semantic trajectories, and the manipulation/conditioning of encodings for editing purposes. A particularly interesting property highlighted by our research, which is also characteristic of this class of generative models, is the independence of the latent representation from the networks implementing the reverse diffusion process. In other words, a common seed passed to different networks (each trained on the same dataset), eventually results in identical images.

> This work addresses an alternative approach for query expansion (QE) using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance the effectiveness of information search in e-commerce. We propose a modified QE conditional GAN (mQE-CGAN) framework, which resolves keywords by expanding the query with a synthetically generated query that proposes semantic information from text input. We train a sequence-to-sequence transformer model as the generator to produce keywords and use a recurrent neural network model as the discriminator to classify an adversarial output with the generator. With the modified CGAN framework, various forms of semantic insights gathered from the query document corpus are introduced to the generation process. We leverage these insights as conditions for the generator model and discuss their effectiveness for the query expansion task. Our experiments demonstrate that the utilization of condition structures within the mQE-CGAN framework can increase the semantic similarity between generated sequences and reference documents up to nearly 10% compared to baseline models

> Ontologies are a standard for semantic schemata in many knowledge-intensive domains of human interest. They are now becoming increasingly important also in areas until very recently dominated by subsymbolic representations and machine-learning-based data processing. One such area is information security, and more specifically malware detection. We propose PE Malware Ontology that offers a reusable semantic schema for Portable Executable (PE, Windows binary format) malware files. The ontology was inspired by the structure of the data in the EMBER dataset and it currently covers the data intended for static malware analysis. With this proposal, we hope to achieve: a) a unified semantic representation for PE malware datasets that are available or will be published in the future; (b) applicability of symbolic, neural-symbolic, or otherwise explainable approaches in the PE Malware domain that may lead to improved interpretability of results which may now be characterized by the terms defined in the ontology; and (c)by joint publishing of semantically treated EMBER data, including fractional datasets, also improved reproducibility of experiments.
